{"agent": "Assistant", "content": "Certainly! Let's analyze the lyrics of \"Human Nature\" to identify the last word before the second chorus.\n\nHere are the lyrics as provided:\n\n```\nLooking out across the nighttime\nThe city winks a sleepless eye\nHear her voice shake my window\nSweet seducing sighs\nGet me out into the nighttime\nFour walls won't hold me tonight\nIf this town is just an apple\nThen let me take a bite\n\nIf they say why?

Does he do me that way?\n\nReaching out to touch a stranger\nElectric eyes are everywhere\nSee that girl she knows I'm watching\nShe likes the way I stare\n\nIf they say why? (Why?) Why? (Why?)\nJust tell 'em that it's human nature\nWhy? (Why?) Why? (Why?) Does he do me that way?\nIf they say why? (Why?) Why? (Why?)\nTell 'em that it's human nature\nWhy? (Why?) Why? (Why?) Does he do me that way?\n\nI like livin' this way\nI like lovin' this way\n(That way) why? Oh, why?\n(That way) why? Oh, why?\n\nLooking out across the morning\nThe city's heart begins to beat\nReaching out, I touch her shoulder\nI'm dreaming of the street\n```\n\nThe first chorus is:\n```\nIf they say why? (Why?) Why? (Why?)\nTell 'em that it's human nature\nWhy? (Why?) Why? (Why?) Does he do me that way?\nIf they say, why? (Why?) Why? (Why?)\nTell 'em that it's human nature\nWhy? (Why?) Why? (Why?) Does he do me that way?\n```\n\nThe second chorus is the same:\n```\nIf they say why? (Why?) Why? (Why?)\nJust tell 'em that it's human nature\nWhy? (Why?) Why? (Why?) Does he do me that way?\nIf they say why? (Why?) Why? (Why?)\nTell 'em that it's human nature\nWhy? (Why?) Why? (Why?) Does he do me that way?\n```\n\nThe verse immediately before the second chorus is:\n```\nReaching out to touch a stranger\nElectric eyes are everywhere\nSee that girl she knows I'm watching\nShe likes the way I stare\n```\n\nThe last word before the second chorus is \"stare.\"\n\nSo, the last word before the second chorus of \"Human Nature\" by Michael Jackson is **\"stare.\"**"}
