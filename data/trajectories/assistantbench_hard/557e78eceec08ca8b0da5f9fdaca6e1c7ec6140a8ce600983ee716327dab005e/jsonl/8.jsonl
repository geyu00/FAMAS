{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich bar is closest to Mummers Museum in Philadelphia and is wheel chair accessible?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n   - The request is for a bar that is closest to Mummers Museum.\n   - The bar must be wheelchair accessible.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact address of Mummers Museum.\n   - A list of bars near Mummers Museum.\n   - Information on the wheelchair accessibility of these bars.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Google Maps, Yelp, or the official website of the Mummers Museum for the museum's address. For nearby bars and their accessibility, local business directories, Google Maps, and Yelp reviews can provide detailed information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The distance between Mummers Museum and each nearby bar.\n   - The closest bar based on the calculated distances.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Philadelphia has a vibrant bar scene, so it is likely that there are several bars within walking distance of Mummers Museum.\n   - Given the city's commitment to accessibility, many bars in popular areas are likely to be wheelchair accessible, but this needs verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Determine the Address of Mummers Museum**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for the official website or a reliable source to find the exact address of Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n\n- **Step 2: Identify Nearby Bars**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps or a similar service to find a list of bars within a short distance of Mummers Museum.\n\n- **Step 3: Check Wheelchair Accessibility of Nearby Bars**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the websites or Yelp pages of the identified bars to check for information on wheelchair accessibility.\n  - **WebSurfer**: If necessary, read through customer reviews to gather additional insights on accessibility.\n\n- **Step 4: Determine the Closest Bar**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to measure the distance from Mummers Museum to each of the accessible bars.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the bar with the shortest distance.\n\n- **Step 5: Compile and Present the Information**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings, including the name of the closest bar, its address, and confirmation of wheelchair accessibility."}
