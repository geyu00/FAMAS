{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nOn Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request involves the Cornell Law School website's legal information institute.\n   - The focus is on the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n   - The task is to find the word deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically on the Cornell Law School website.\n   - The article within that section that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles.\n   - The first rule in that article.\n   - The last amendment to that first rule as of 2021.\n   - The specific word that was deleted in that last amendment.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which article has \"witnesses\" in the most titles.\n   - Identifying the exact wording changes in the last amendment to the first rule.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically might be \"Federal Rules of Evidence\" (FRE), but this needs verification.\n   - The article with \"witnesses\" in the most titles is likely to be Article VI of the FRE, which deals with witnesses.\n   - The word deleted could be a common term related to witness testimony, such as \"testimony,\" \"deposition,\" or \"sworn.\" However, this is speculative and needs to be confirmed.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify the Fifth Section of Federal Rules Alphabetically**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Cornell Law School website's legal information institute and locate the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n\n- **Step 2: Find the Article with \"Witnesses\" in the Most Titles**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Within the identified section, find the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles.\n\n- **Step 3: Locate the First Rule in the Identified Article**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the first rule in the article found in Step 2.\n\n- **Step 4: Determine the Last Amendment to the First Rule as of 2021**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Find the last amendment to the first rule in the identified article, specifically as of 2021.\n\n- **Step 5: Identify the Word Deleted in the Last Amendment**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Examine the text of the last amendment to determine the specific word that was deleted.\n\n- **Step 6: Verify and Report the Findings**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the findings and report back the word that was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article with \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021."}

Competency to Testify in General \n Rule 601. Competency to Testify in General \n Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise. But in a civil case, state law governs the witness’s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision. \n Notes \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds of incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are religious belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the litigation as a party or interested person or spouse of a party or interested person. With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's Acts, American jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize these grounds. \n The Dead Man's Acts are surviving traces of the common law disqualification of parties and interested persons. They exist in variety too great to convey conviction of their wisdom and effectiveness. These rules contain no provision of this kind. For the reasoning underlying the decision not to give effect to state statutes in diversity cases, see the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 501. \n No mental or moral qualifications for testifying as a witness are specified. Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore §§501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty. This result may, however, be accomplished more directly, and without haggling in terms of legal standards, by the manner of administering the oath or affirmation under Rule 603. \n Admissibility of religious belief as a ground of impeachment is treated in Rule 610. Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Federal Rules of Evidence Toolbox \nWex: \nEvidence: Overview\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@graph\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"BreadcrumbList\",\n                \"itemListElement\": [\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 1,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu\",\n                            \"name\": \"LII\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 2,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre\",\n                            \"name\": \"Federal Rules of Evidence\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 5,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_601\",\n                            \"name\": \"\\nRule 601.

This amendment was primarily stylistic, aimed at restyling the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to ensure consistency in style and terminology throughout the rules. Specifically, the word \"otherwise\" was deleted from the rule, which originally stated, \"Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules.\" The amendment changed this to \"Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise,\" with the intention of making the rule clearer and more consistent without altering its substantive meaning."}
