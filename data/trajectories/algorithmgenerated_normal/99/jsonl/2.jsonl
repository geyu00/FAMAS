{"agent": "Ticket_Pricing_Expert", "content": "To start solving the task, I will first gather the necessary ticket pricing information for the Philadelphia Museum of Art. \n\n1. **Daily ticket prices**:\n   - Daily ticket price for an adult: $20 (assuming this as a typical price).\n   - Daily ticket price for a student: $14 (assuming this as a typical price).\n\n2. **Annual pass prices**:\n   - Annual pass price for an adult: $80 (assuming this as a typical price).\n   - Annual pass price for a student: $50 (assuming this as a typical price).\n\nNow, I will calculate the total cost for daily tickets and the total cost for annual passes based on these assumptions. \n\n### Total cost for daily tickets\n- For 4 adults visiting 5 times:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total for adults} = 4 \\text{ adults} \\times 5 \\text{ visits} \\times 20 \\text{ (daily ticket price)} = 4 \\times 5 \\times 20\n  \\]\n  \n- For 1 student visiting 5 times:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total for student} = 1 \\text{ student} \\times 5 \\text{ visits} \\times 14 \\text{ (daily ticket price)} = 1 \\times 5 \\times 14\n  \\]\n\n### Total cost for annual passes\n- For 4 adults:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total for adults} = 4 \\text{ adults} \\times 80 \\text{ (annual pass price)} = 4 \\times 80\n  \\]\n  \n- For 1 student:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total for student} = 1 \\text{ student} \\times 50 \\text{ (annual pass price)} = 1 \\times 50\n  \\]\n\nLet's put all this into a Python code to calculate the costs.
