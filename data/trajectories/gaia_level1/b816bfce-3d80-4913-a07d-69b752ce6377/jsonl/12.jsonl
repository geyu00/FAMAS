{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expresses distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of the journal, which is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The specific word quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - The identity of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n   - The exact context and content of the quotes.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house (from Norse mythology).\n   - The relevance of the journal's name to the content of the article.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Hreidmar's son who guarded his house is likely Fafnir, as he is the most famous for transforming into a dragon and guarding treasure in Norse mythology.\n   - The word in question could be something like \"cliché,\" \"tiresome,\" or \"ridiculous,\" given the context of distaste for dragon depictions.\n   - The journal is likely a specialized publication related to mythology, literature, or fantasy studies.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Journal Name**: Use WebSurfer to search for information about Hreidmar's sons and identify the son who guarded his house. This will help determine the name of the journal.\n- **Locate the Article**: Once the journal name is identified, use WebSurfer to find Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the specified journal.\n- **Extract the Word**: Read the article to locate the word quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for dragon depictions. Note the exact context and the identities of the authors.\n- **Verify the Information**: Cross-check the extracted word and author quotes to ensure accuracy.\n- **Summarize the Findings**: Compile the results and present the word, the authors, and any relevant context."}

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children’s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children’s literature dragons.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expresses distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - The journal is named \"Fafnir\" (verified from the search results).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific word quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - The identity of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n   - The exact context and content of the quotes.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house (from Norse mythology) is Fafnir.\n   - The relevance of the journal's name to the content of the article, which focuses on dragons and fantasy literature.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The word in question could be something like \"cliché,\" \"tiresome,\" or \"ridiculous,\" given the context of distaste for dragon depictions. This remains a strong guess based on the nature of academic discourse and the common criticisms of overused tropes in literature.\n   - The two authors whose quotes were used might be well-known scholars in the field of children's literature or fantasy studies. Given the focus on the uncanny and Freudian analysis, authors like Maria Tatar or Jack Zipes could be potential candidates.\n   - The journal \"Fafnir\" is a specialized publication related to mythology, literature, and fantasy studies, which aligns with the content of Emily Midkiff's article.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The journal name \"Fafnir\" confirms that the article is indeed in a publication focused on fantasy and mythology, which supports the idea that the word in question is likely a critique of overused or clichéd dragon depictions.\n- Authors like Maria Tatar and Jack Zipes are well-respected in the field of children's literature and often discuss the evolution and representation of mythical creatures, making them plausible candidates for the quotes.\n- The term \"cliché\" fits well with the academic tone and the critical perspective on modern dragon depictions in children's literature.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Repetitive Scrolling:** The web surfer was repeatedly scrolling through the same sections of the article without locating the specific word and authors.\n- **Lack of Specific Search:** The web surfer did not use specific search techniques within the article to find the word and authors efficiently.\n- **Inadequate Focus on Key Sections:** The web surfer did not focus on key sections of the article where the word and authors might be mentioned, such as the introduction or conclusion.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Direct Link to the Article:** Ensure the web surfer navigates directly to the PDF version of the article if available, as it may be easier to search within a PDF.\n- **Use Search Function:** Utilize the search function (Ctrl + F) within the article to look for keywords related to the word and authors.\n- **Focus on Key Sections:** Specifically search the introduction, conclusion, and any sections discussing the nature of dragon depictions.\n- **Summarize Key Points:** Summarize the key points of the article to ensure we are on the right track and to identify any relevant sections.\n- **Cross-Check Quotes:** Once the word and authors are found, cross-check the quotes to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the Article:**\n   - Use the web surfer to navigate directly to the PDF version of Emily Midkiff's article in the June 2014 issue of the journal Fafnir.\n   \n2. **Use Search Function:**\n   - Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to look for keywords such as \"cliché,\" \"tiresome,\" \"ridiculous,\" \"quote,\" \"author,\" \"dragon depiction,\" and \"distaste.\"\n   \n3. **Focus on Key Sections:**\n   - Specifically search the introduction, conclusion, and any sections discussing the nature of dragon depictions.\n   \n4. **Summarize Key Points:**\n   - Summarize the key points of the article to ensure we are on the right track and to identify any relevant sections.\n   \n5. **Locate the Word and Authors:**\n   - Identify the specific word quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - Note the identities of the two authors.\n   \n6. **Cross-Check Quotes:**\n   - Cross-check the quotes to ensure accuracy and provide the exact context and content of the quotes.\n\n7. **Compile the Results:**\n   - Compile the results and present the word, the authors, and any relevant context.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Use PDF Reader:** If the article is available in PDF format, use a PDF reader to search for the keywords more efficiently.\n- **Look for Academic Tone:** Pay attention to sections that have an academic tone and discuss the evolution or representation of dragons in literature.\n- **Check References:** If the word and authors are not immediately found, check the references section for any cited works that might provide clues.\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to locate the specific word and authors more efficiently and avoid the repetitive scrolling issue."}

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children's literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children's literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children's literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons' intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children's literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children's literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.\nclose\nDownload your PDF for free\nSign up to get access to over 50 million papers\nContinue with Google\nContinue with Apple\nContinue with Facebook\nemail\nContinue with Email\nBy continuing, you agree to our\nTerms of Use\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Indeed, few unnatural animals of any kind were to be found there. The fantasy beings that populated Victorian tales were overwhelmingly humanoid-ghosts, Doppelgangers {umlauted a}, mer-folk, fairies, witches, or magicians. Even when dragons became popular in nineteenth-century illustration, they were not yet popular in writing, and did not become so until the end of the century. Fantasy beings of all sorts, including dragons, had been absent from most eighteenth-century writing. Samuel Johnson in his \"Preface to Shakespeare\" condemned \"adventures, giants, dragons, and enchantments\" as proper only to primitive and plebian tastes. In the nineteenth-century prose wonder tales, the adventures, giants, and enchantments returned, but not the dragons. Dragons were probably avoided because the idea of the dragon had acquired a specific religious and allegorical meaning, too obvious for subtle characterization, and too specifically Christian for use in secular tales. Secular literature demanded secular figures. Even when the underlying meanings were Christian, as in the tales of George MacDonald, the surface mythology was not. He used characters common in folklore: fairy godmothers and nature spirits rather than angels as supernatural guardians and wicked witches, fairies, goblins, and giants rather than demons as supernatural tempters. (Lilith, his last fantasy, with the opposition of Lilith and Adam, was the only one to make use of supernatural figures overtly Judeo-Christian.) The dragon, unlike such folklore-based figures as fairies, with their potential for both good and evil, had become rigidly fixed [p. 221] with a single, overtly religious meaning. It was the dragon of Milton, Spenser, and the book of Revelations: it was Satan and absolutely evil. This view of the dragon as evil goes back to antiquity, and the best known dragons of ancient myth reinforced the idea of the dragon as simply and utterly evil. But this stereotype of the dragon as evil distorted the animal's mythic nature. As Joseph L. Fontenrose shows in his Python, the dragon is an ambivalent creature. Hero and dragon change places easily, and the dragon has its kindly side: The Chinese dragons are in general benevolent and beneficient deities, who send rain and bring good crops. They also bring thunderstorms, tempests, whirlwinds, and floods. Like Zeus or Baal, they bring both good and bad weather; for the god, we should not forget, can send both good and evil upon mortal man. And at this point we should also realise that dragons and snakes did not have a uniformly bad reputation in Greece and the Near East. Greece too had its benevolent reptilian deities: snakes that were spirits of springs, genii loci, embodiments or attributes of gods, e.g., Asklepios, Athena, Apollo … Zeus himself. [side-note: Joseph L. Fontenrose, Python, A Study of Delphic Myth and its Origins, pp. 401-492] (The interchangeability of hero and dragon is further discussed in pp. 469-474 of this work.) The dragon's strength made the red dragon the symbol of Wales and Arthur's Britain.

R. R. Tolkien above all. Far from being considered a complete research work, due to the vast amount of information and books on the subjects, this essay focuses on the Nordic dragon of manuscripts such as Beowulf (Cotton Vitellius A. xv.), the Nibelungenlied, the Völsungasaga and the section on The Elder Edda named Fáfnismál.\ndownload\nDownload free PDF\nView PDF\nchevron_right\n“Tolkien’s Dragons: Sources, Symbols, and Significance”\nCamilo PeraltaSymbolism, vol. 21, no. 1, 2021\nTolkien’s dragons are well-known to readers of The Hobbit and The Silmarillion, and scholars have long been interested in exploring the influences he drew upon in creating Smaug and his kindred. To date, however, most of their attention has focused on sources from the literary traditions of Old English and Old Norse, especially the dragons mentioned in Beowulf and in the Prose and Poetic Edda of medieval Iceland. In this article, I examine some of the more neglected sources that may have inspired Tolkien’s conception of these creatures, focusing on classical mythology, the Bible, and medieval English literature. My main interest is in how the symbolic roles of dragons within these traditions influenced their counterparts in Middle-earth. It is clear that, in making use of dragons as symbols of evil or tests of courage, Tolkien owes much to these ancient sources. At the same time, and in the manner of all great authors, he clearly adapts them to serve new ends that reflect his concerns as a Catholic living in England during the twentieth century. A more comprehensive understanding of how Tolkien’s dragons function as symbols may provide additional insight into certain postlapsarian themes and the importance of eucatastrophe within the legendarium as a whole.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named \"Fafnir,\" which is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expresses distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - The journal \"Fafnir\" is a specialized publication related to mythology, literature, and fantasy studies.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific word quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - The identity of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n   - The exact context and content of the quotes.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house (from Norse mythology) is Fafnir.\n   - The relevance of the journal's name to the content of the article, which focuses on dragons and fantasy literature.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The word in question could be something like \"cliché,\" \"tiresome,\" or \"ridiculous,\" given the context of distaste for dragon depictions. This remains a strong guess based on the nature of academic discourse and the common criticisms of overused tropes in literature.\n   - The two authors whose quotes were used might be well-known scholars in the field of children's literature or fantasy studies. Given the focus on the uncanny and Freudian analysis, authors like Maria Tatar or Jack Zipes could be potential candidates.\n   - The term \"cliché\" fits well with the academic tone and the critical perspective on modern dragon depictions in children's literature.\n   - The article likely discusses the evolution of dragon depictions in children's literature, contrasting modern, often softened or satirized dragons with the more traditional, uncanny dragons from mythology.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The journal name \"Fafnir\" confirms that the article is indeed in a publication focused on fantasy and mythology, which supports the idea that the word in question is likely a critique of overused or clichéd dragon depictions.\n- Authors like Maria Tatar and Jack Zipes are well-respected in the field of children's literature and often discuss the evolution and representation of mythical creatures, making them plausible candidates for the quotes.\n- The term \"cliché\" fits well with the academic tone and the critical perspective on modern dragon depictions in children's literature.\n- The abstract of the article mentions a trend to soften and satirize dragons, which suggests that the word in question is likely a criticism of this trend.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Download the PDF**: Ensure the PDF version of Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the journal Fafnir is downloaded.\n2. **Search the PDF**: Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to look for the words 'cliché', 'tiresome', 'ridiculous', 'quote', 'author', 'dragon depiction', and 'distaste'.\n3. **Focus on Key Sections**: Specifically search the introduction, conclusion, and any sections discussing the nature of dragon depictions.\n4. **Identify the Word and Authors**: Identify the specific word quoted from two different authors and note the identities of the two authors.\n5. **Cross-Check Quotes**: Cross-check the quotes to ensure accuracy and provide the exact context and content of the quotes.\n\nLet's proceed with downloading the PDF and searching for the word and authors.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Repetitive Actions**: We repeatedly attempted to download the PDF but did not confirm whether the download was successful or if the PDF was opened.\n- **Lack of Confirmation**: There was no verification step to ensure the PDF was actually downloaded and accessible.\n- **Inefficient Search**: We did not use the search function effectively once the PDF was opened, leading to delays and potential missed information.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Confirm Download**: Ensure the PDF is successfully downloaded and opened.\n- **Use Search Function**: Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to look for the specific words and phrases.\n- **Focus on Key Sections**: Focus on the introduction, conclusion, and sections discussing dragon depictions.\n- **Identify and Note**: Identify the specific word and the two authors, and note the exact context and content of the quotes.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Download the PDF**:\n   - Navigate to the PDF download link on the Academia.edu page.\n   - Confirm the PDF is downloaded and saved locally.\n\n2. **Open the PDF**:\n   - Use a PDF reader to open the downloaded PDF.\n   - Verify that the PDF is open and readable.\n\n3. **Use Search Function**:\n   - Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to look for the words 'cliché', 'tiresome', 'ridiculous', 'quote', 'author', 'dragon depiction', and 'distaste'.\n   - Focus on the introduction, conclusion, and any sections discussing the nature of dragon depictions.\n\n4. **Identify the Word and Authors**:\n   - Identify the specific word quoted from two different authors.\n   - Note the identities of the two authors.\n   - Cross-check the quotes to ensure accuracy and provide the exact context and content of the quotes.\n\n5. **Compile the Results**:\n   - Compile the results and present the word, the authors, and any relevant context.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Use PDF Reader**: Ensure the PDF reader is capable of searching within the document.\n- **Check for Multiple Pages**: If the word or authors are not found on the first page, continue searching through the entire document.\n- **Look for Academic Tone**: Pay attention to sections that have an academic tone and discuss the evolution or representation of dragons in literature.\n- **Check References**: If the word and authors are not immediately found, check the references section for any cited works that might provide clues.\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to efficiently locate the specific word and authors and avoid the previous issues."}

This   disconnect   with   traditional\ndragons   has   been   bemoaned   as   ruining   the   mythic   and   archetypal   power   of\ndragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than\nreadily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore:\nthe eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore,\nfrom which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary\nbeasts,   but   they   also   created   a   distinctly   unsettling   atmosphere   in   their   stories.\nModern   tamed   and   human-like   children’s   literature   dragons   borrow   certain\nuncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not\nalways   life-threatening   characters.   In   specific,   two   traits   borrowed   from   the\noriginal lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’\nintensely   possessive   gaze   and   their   clever,   manipulative   speech.   This   article\nanalyzes   these  Freudian   inheritances   to   argue   that   children’s   literature   dragons\nhave   not   been   entirely   softened   and   satirized;   the   potential   for   uncanny   fear\nembodied by  the human-like  behaviors  of legendary Western dragons  lingers  in\nmany modern children’s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are\nstill   strong   characters   and   can   and   should   be   analyzed   productively   through   a\nFreudian uncanny lens.\n\nKeywords: Dragon, uncanny, Freud, children’s literature\n\nBiography and contact info: Emily Midkiff (MA, English and Children's Literature) is teaching and\nworking on her PhD at the University of Minnesota.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien once declared that “the dragon in legend is a potent creation of men’s imagination,\nricher in significance than his barrow is in gold” (“The Monsters” 16). Dragons in mythology have\ncome   to   be   recognized   for   their   value   as   representations   of   ancient   cultures   or   as   worldwide\narchetypes. Anthropologists have found and studied dragons in nearly all surviving mythologies;\nmedievalists have examined them in manuscripts and bestiaries. In modern literature, dragons have\nflourished in their newer realm of fantasy and children’s literature as one of its most pervasive\nmythic animals.\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n41\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nThe Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature\n\nYet   within   children’s   literature,   scholars   have   noted   a   trend   beginning   even   before   the\ndragon’s mass popularity in fantasy to soften and satirize the dragon for children. While this type of\nfriendly dragon has become a well known resident of children’s  books, this  article argues that\nchildren’s literature dragons have been not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for\nuncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many\nmodern children’s literature dragons.\n\nFluffy Dragons\n\nIn comparison to ancient dragon lore, modern dragons for children inspire less terror and more\nlaughter, beginning most noticeably with Kenneth Grahame’s “The Reluctant Dragon” in 1898.\nRuth Stein in 1968 and Margaret Blount in 1974 both comment with distaste on the increasingly\ncuddly,   “fluffy”   nature   of   dragons   in   children’s   literature.   In   a   short   article   for  Elementary\nEducation,   Stein   expresses   hope   that   Tolkien’s   Smaug   would   improve   the   literary   dragon’s\nevolution   and  encourage   properly   scary   dragons.  While   this   has   since   proved  true   in  part,   the\nbemoaned   fluffy   dragons   remain   prevalent   alongside   Tolkien’s   menacing   breed.   Nonetheless\nBlount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they\ncould be less than terrifying and still remain “real dragons” (129). She points out several stories that\nfail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally\nbehave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in\norder to inspire conflict. Jon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a “real” dragon is and\neven praises the proliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame’s dragon, as parodies of the\noutdated cultural codes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223).\n\nHope Shastri’s 1992 dissertation on the picture book dragon gives concrete results to support\nthe observations of scholars like Stein, Blount, and Stott. Shastri performed a content analysis of\n151 picture books produced between 1950 and 1992 in order to ascertain"}
