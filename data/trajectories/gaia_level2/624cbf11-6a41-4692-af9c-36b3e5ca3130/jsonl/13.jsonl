Before presenting all of the discontinued B&J flavors, let\\u2019s answer a few basic questions about how you can visit the factory in Vermont and see the graveyard for yourself.                                                                    Where is the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor graveyard?    The graveyard is located at the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s company factory at 1281 Waterbury-Stowe Rd, Waterbury Village Historic District, VT 05676.     Note \\u2013 it\\u2019s not located at the company headquarters. The Ben & Jerry\\u2019s headquarters are in South Burlington, Vermont. The company factory is in Waterbury.    The graveyard is located in the rear of the factory parking lot. Follow the signs up a slight hill, past a playground, and you\\u2019ll spot the bright purple graveyard gate.    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"681\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ice-cream-headstones.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ice cream headstones\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19990\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ice-cream-headstones.jpg 500w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ice-cream-headstones-330x450.jpg 330w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ice-cream-headstones-441x600.jpg 441w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\\\" />                                                                    How much does it cost to visit the B&J graveyard?    You can visit the graveyard for free. But if you\\u2019d like to take the factory tour to see how the ice cream is made (and you should), that\\u2019ll cost $6 for adults and $5 for kids.     What hours is it open?    The B&J factory is open from 11 am to 6 pm Tuesday through Saturday. It\\u2019s closed Sunday and Monday.     How many flavors are in Ben & Jerry\\u2019s graveyard?    As of this writing, there are 44 flavors with headstones in the flavor graveyard. That number changes over time, as flavors are discontinued and new headstones have to be added to the graveyard.    What does the graveyard look like?    It looks like a literal graveyard, with stone markers for each flavor, although the headstones feature bright and colorful logos and epitaphs in the form of poems.     The graveyard has a striking purple gate at the entrance and a white picket fence surrounding it.    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"796\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben and jerrys flavor graveyard\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19971\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-1.jpg 600w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-1-339x450.jpg 339w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-1-452x600.jpg 452w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\\\" />Front gate of the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor graveyard.                                                                    Is every discontinued Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor in the graveyard?    Nope! This was surprising to learn. There are actually tons of old flavors that, for whatever reason, have not been given a headstone and a spot in the flavor graveyard. Those include Mocha Walnut, Hazed & Confused, and Fred & Ginger (a tribute to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.)     Scroll to the end of the article for a list of more discontinued flavors that aren\\u2019t in the graveyard.                                                                    Are abandoned flavors ever brought back from the flavor graveyard?    Yes, occasionally! In 2022, Ben & Jerry\\u2019s resurrected Dublin Mudslide after a 15-year hiatus and removed it from the flavor graveyard.     Dublin Mudslide features Irish cream liqueur ice cream with chocolate chip cookies and a coffee fudge swirl. Yum! The flavor originally existed from 2005 to 2007.    All the Flavors Currently in the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Flavor Graveyard    Let\\u2019s run down all the flavors currently on display in the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor graveyard (\\u201cOur Dearly De-pinted\\u201d), one by one. I\\u2019ve personally tried many of these flavors. Some of them were among my favorite ice cream flavors of all-time. Some I had no idea had been discontinued!     For each flavor, we\\u2019ll give the official Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor description, followed by the silly and fun epitaph on the headstone in the graveyard.    Oatmeal Cookie Chunk (2004-2012)    Sweet cream cinnamon ice cream with oatmeal cookies & fudge chunks    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"683\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/oatmeal-cookie-chunk.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"oatmeal cookie chunk\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19950\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/oatmeal-cookie-chunk.jpg 500w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/oatmeal-cookie-chunk-329x450.jpg 329w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/oatmeal-cookie-chunk-439x600.jpg 439w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\\\" />                                                                    Let\\u2019s start off with a bang, with my favorite ice cream flavor of all-time. That\\u2019s right, Oatmeal Cookie Chunk is the greatest ice cream flavor in the history of humankind! According to my taste buds, at least.    What made it so great? Start with a sweet cream cinnamon ice cream. That base is packed with flavor and unspeakably delicious. Then add in chocolate chunks and huge swaths of oatmeal cookie dough, and you have a flawless combination.    Backstory: My entire life, I used to wonder why cookie dough ice cream was just boring vanilla ice cream with tiny little unsatisfying balls of cookie dough tossed in. Why, I wondered, couldn\\u2019t they swirl in huge swaths of the cookie dough? Why couldn\\u2019t half the container be cookie dough swirls?    And then I discovered Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Oatmeal Cookie Chunk, and its robust cookie dough swaths. And my life was changed. Suddenly, anything was possible in the world of ice cream!    This was one of the longest-lasting flavors in the graveyard, remaining in stores for 8 years before it was discontinued.                                                                     The only reason I\\u2019m not depressed about its absence is that B&J now has a similar flavor, Oat of This Swirled, which features oatmeal cookie dough swirled into a brown sugar ice cream. It\\u2019s similar enough to give me that oatmeal cookie fix I need.    KaBerry KaBoom (2001)    Strawberry & blueberry ice creams with fudge-covered cracklin\\u2019 candy & a blueberry swirl    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"793\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kaberry-kaboom.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"kaberry kaboom flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19951\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kaberry-kaboom.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kaberry-kaboom-312x450.jpg 312w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kaberry-kaboom-416x600.jpg 416w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Yikes. It\\u2019s not hard to see why this one failed! Cracklin\\u2019 candies in ice cream? I could see that maybe working if done correctly. But covering the candy in chocolate is definitely not the way to do it. Imagine Nerds or Skittles covered in chocolate. Nobody wants that!    Also, strawberry and blueberry together is just way too sweet. I never got to try this flavor, but I can totally get why it didn\\u2019t survive even one full year.    Schweddy Balls (2011)    Vanilla ice cream with a hint of rum, loaded with fudge-covered rum & malt balls    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/schweddy-balls-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"schweddy balls ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19953\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/schweddy-balls-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/schweddy-balls-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/schweddy-balls-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Only Ben and Jerry are crazy enough to conceive an ice cream flavor around a Saturday Night Live sketch from a decade earlier.     That would be the famous 1998 sketch featuring Alec Baldwin as Pete Schweddy, a baker whose \\u201cSchweddy balls\\u201d were a favorite holiday dessert.    Schweddy Balls was a limited edition holiday batch for 2011, so it was never expected to live forever. Rum balls in a vanilla ice cream doesn\\u2019t sound like a combination that could last for years anyway. It was just a novelty flavor.    You can see that someone left roses at this headstone. That\\u2019s just silly enough to be funny.    Dave Matthews Band\\u2019s Magic Brownies (2007-2011)    Black raspberry ice cream swirled with sweet cream ice cream & fudgy brownies    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dave-matthews-band-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"dave matthews band ben &amp; jerrys ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19955\\\" style=\\\"width:550px;height:800px\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dave-matthews-band-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dave-matthews-band-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dave-matthews-band-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    The Dave Matthews Band was one of the biggest bands in the world in the early 2000s, and they shared a similar worldview with Ben & Jerry\\u2019s. Hence, a collab was born.    Magic Brownies was actually the second Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor in honor of DMB. I distinctly remember the first, called One Sweet Whirled (after the DMB tune \\u201cOne Sweet World\\u201d). That flavor arrived in 2002 and featured caramel and coffee ice creams with marshmallow swirls and coffee-flavored chocolate chips.     As a huge DMB fan, I was compelled to buy One Sweet Whirled, even though I don\\u2019t like coffee. It was decent, but only lasted until 2004.                                                                     Three years later, B&J decided to try another DMB flavor, this time with a raspberry kick. I don\\u2019t love raspberry in ice cream, so I never got around to trying the Magic Brownies.     Fresh Georgia Peach (1986-1991)    Vanilla ice cream with fresh Georgia peaches    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-graveyard-peach.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben jerrys graveyard peach\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19957\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-graveyard-peach.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-graveyard-peach-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-graveyard-peach-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Here\\u2019s one of the oldest flavors in the graveyard. Georgia peach was created in 1986, and it was very simple. Just vanilla ice cream with peaches. That was enough to last for five years.    I absolutely love peach ice cream, and would\\u2019ve been all over this flavor if I\\u2019d had the chance, but it was before my ice cream-buying time. B&J later created a Willie Nelson Peach Cobbler flavor that added shortbread into the mix.    What a Cluster (aka Clusterfluff) (2011-2014)    Peanut butter ice cream with caramel cluster pieces, marshmallow swirls & peanut buttery swirls    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clusterfluff-ben-jerrys.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"clusterfluff ben jerrys\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19958\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clusterfluff-ben-jerrys.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clusterfluff-ben-jerrys-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clusterfluff-ben-jerrys-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Here\\u2019s the other flavor in the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor graveyard that I miss dearly. What a Cluster is another of my all-time fave ice cream flavors.     It\\u2019s basically peanut butter and marshmallow, which is an incredible combination, with the added sweetness and crunchy texture of caramel clusters. It was modeled after fluffernutter. I was so bummed when this flavor went away!    Interesting fact \\u2013 this one was originally called Clusterfluff. That was a fun and slightly edgy play on words. And then shortly after, with no announcement or explanation, they changed it to the much more boring What a Cluster. Did Ben & Jerry\\u2019s succumb to consumer complaints about the name? Who knows, but that name change always bothered me.    Peanuts! Popcorn!

Gotta give kudos to Ben and Jerry for trying new things. But it didn\\u2019t quite work.     I have to say, the idea of peanuts and popcorn in ice cream doesn\\u2019t sound that appetizing initially. But when you read further, and realize that the popcorn was actually caramel popcorn, and that it was covered in white chocolate, and the peanuts were covered in toffee\\u2026 that actually sounds tasty!    Evidently, customers didn\\u2019t think so, as it disappeared in 2000, the same year it hit the market.

Plain old neapolitan isn\\u2019t really going to excite the typical B&J buyer. The company understood that and changed the neapolitan formula.    Instead of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry, Neapolitan Dynamite offered a pairing of Cherry Garcia and Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice creams instead. I never tried this one, but enough fans of the movie bought it that it hung around for four years.    Oh Pear (1997)    Fresh pear ice cream with a hint of almond and a light fudge swirl    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-pear-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben &amp; jerry's pear ice cream \\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19962\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-pear-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-pear-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-pear-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    One of the great mysteries of life for me is why there are so many peach-flavored foods and drinks, and so few pear-flavored ones. I love pear and never understood why there isn\\u2019t pear cobbler, pear-flavored soda, pear ice cream, pear yogurt, and all the rest.    Imagine my surprise upon learning that Ben & Jerry\\u2019s once produced a pear ice cream! But it was here for such a short time, I blinked and missed it.    Reading the description, though, I\\u2019m not sure how good it would\\u2019ve been. Ben & Jerry have this unfortunate compulsion to add chocolate to flavors that don\\u2019t need it (like Oatmeal Cookie Chunk.) And here we see that their pear ice cream actually had a fudge swirl. WTF, B & J?    I think the way to make a pear flavor work would\\u2019ve been to keep the mix-ins to a minimum. A few shaved almonds are fine, and maybe some cinnamon or brown sugar to punch it up a little. That\\u2019s all you need.     Holy Cannoli (1997-1998)    Creamy Ricotta and pistachio ice cream with chocolate-covered cannolis and roasted pistachio    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/holy-cannoli-flavor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"holy cannoli flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19964\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/holy-cannoli-flavor.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/holy-cannoli-flavor-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/holy-cannoli-flavor-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    I wonder if the reason Holy Cannoli never took off is that many people don\\u2019t know what cannolis are. It\\u2019s not a common dessert in most parts of the country.     The cannoli is a delicious Italian pastry stuffed with a creamy filling. I actually just had my first cannoli recently at Mike\\u2019s Pastry in the Cambridge neighborhood of Boston.     I\\u2019d totally buy Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Holy Cannoli if it came out today, but I never tried it back in the day.                                                                    The epitaph speculates that perhaps people were turned off by the pistachios, but I\\u2019m not so sure about that. Ben & Jerry\\u2019s has a Pistachio flavor that is still going strong.     I think that cannolis were just too unfamiliar, or the idea of Ricotta cheese in an ice cream didn\\u2019t sound appetizing enough.

But a glimpse at the ingredient list shows that there\\u2019s no actual cake in there \\u2013 just ice cream made to taste like cake batter. There aren\\u2019t even any rainbow sprinkles \\u2013 just a swirl of chocolate frosting.    The company did later make an actual \\u201cBirthday Cake\\u201d flavor that was more in tune with the kind of cake ice creams people are craving these days.

A traditional Boston Cream Pie is delicious, and this one captured its essence successfully, with the fudge and the pasty cream swirl.     Sad to see this one go, but at least it had a respectable six-year run!    UPDATE: Last year, Ben & Jerry\\u2019s released Bossin\\u2019 Cream Pie, an updated version of this flavor. It\\u2019s basically the same, except the layer of chocolate and chips are right on the top, rather than swirled in. I tried it and sadly didn\\u2019t love it, because the chocolate is hard and crunchy, rather than smooth and soft, as it is on the actual pie itself.

In the meantime, let\\u2019s mourn the loss of Wild Maine Blueberry ice cream. This was a rare Ben & Jerry\\u2019s offering that featured a fruit puree as part of the blend. We haven\\u2019t really seen other purees since then, so evidently customers made their voices heard that it wasn\\u2019t a winning formula.     Peanut Butter Me Up (2002-2003)    A peanut butter caramel core surrounded by peanut butter & chocolate ice creams with fudge chips                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanut-butter-me-up-ben-jerry.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"peanut butter me up ben jerry\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19968\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanut-butter-me-up-ben-jerry.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanut-butter-me-up-ben-jerry-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanut-butter-me-up-ben-jerry-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />    A peanut butter flavor that didn\\u2019t sell?

It sounds especially delicious \\u2013 peanut butter and chocolate ice creams with a peanut butter caramel core.                                                                    Maybe back in 2002, Ben & Jerry\\u2019s hadn\\u2019t yet mastered the \\u201ccore\\u201d ice cream techniques. These days, they have lots of flavors with a core filling, but they didn\\u2019t have many two decades ago. In fact, this was one of the first three \\u201ccore\\u201d ice creams the company created, which all debuted in 2002. Perhaps consumers weren\\u2019t yet ready for that type of dairy innovation.     Or maybe the caramel part was a turnoff. Caramel really doesn\\u2019t belong here. Ben and Jerry should hire someone to edit their flavor combinations before they hit the market!    Chocolate Comfort (1999)    Chocolate truffle ice low fat ice cream swirled with white chocolate low fat ice cream    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chocolate-comfort.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"chocolate comfort\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19969\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chocolate-comfort.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chocolate-comfort-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chocolate-comfort-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    You have to really screw something up to create a chocolate-flavored ice cream that people don\\u2019t like. So how did Ben & Jerry do it?    Well, the main crime was attempting a low-fat ice cream. If you\\u2019ve ever checked the label on a pint of Ben & Jerry\\u2019s you know that it\\u2019s absolutely loaded with calories and fat. We just accept that as the tradeoff for all that flavor.    This was an attempt to find out if there was a market for a lower-fat flavor, and apparently there was not. But I also think that making it a \\u201cchocolate truffle\\u201d flavor was a bad idea. I know truffles are all the rage, but a lot of us just don\\u2019t like truffle flavor and would never buy a flavor like this.

I\\u2019ve never seen such a flavor anywhere. Perhaps there\\u2019s a reason for that. If B&J couldn\\u2019t make it work, maybe no one can.    Who is Miz Jelena, by the way? I have no idea. I found a company called \\u201cMiz Jelena\\u2019s Homemade Southern Cookin'\\u201d that incorporated in 1992, the same year this ice cream hit the market, so perhaps there was a connection. Maybe Ben & Jerry had plans to create a whole line of southern-themed Miz Jelena ice creams if this one worked out. Alas, it did not.

The name is so off-putting. I cringe every time I read it.    Still, if the ice cream had featured lots of delicious mix-ins, I would\\u2019ve overlooked the name and given it a try. But it was literally just vanilla ice cream with nuts, fudge, and caramel. It\\u2019s hard to imagine a less inventive combination.    Pina Colada (2013)    Coconut ice cream with pineapple chunks                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pina-colada-ben-jerry.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"pina colada - ben &amp; jerry's graveyard\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19975\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pina-colada-ben-jerry.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pina-colada-ben-jerry-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pina-colada-ben-jerry-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />    Pineapple chunks mixed into coconut ice cream? Sign me up! Pina Colada ice cream was absolutely delicious. I wish this flavor had become a staple of the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s product line, but they chose to make it a Limited Batch, available only during summer 2013.                                                                    Interesting fact: I loved this ice cream during its brief run. When it went off the market, I was forced to look around to find other brands that had similar flavors. I finally located Haagen Dazs\\u2019 Pineapple Coconut, which has remained one of my favorites for the past several years.     So Ben & Jerry inadvertently created more business for their rival, by getting me addicted to a flavor and then immediately pulling it off the market. That\\u2019s probably not what they had in mind!    P.S. Pineapple lovers may want to check out my article about visiting the Dole Plantation in Hawaii.

They\\u2019re similar to Moon Pies, the beloved product of Chattanooga, Tennessee. But Whoopie Pies tend to be softer and feature chocolate, while Moon Pies can have various flavors.    Ben and Jerry chose to give their Whoopie Pie ice cream a clever name that recalls the Newlywed Game. And they opted to feature a chocolate ice cream base with marshmallow and devil\\u2019s food cookies swirled in. That sounds tasty! Every ice cream I\\u2019ve ever tried that features marshmallow has been delicious. I wish I\\u2019d gotten a chance to try this one.

Vermonty Python (2006-2008)    Coffee liqueur ice cream with a chocolate cookie crumb swirl and fudge cows    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vermonty-python-flavor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"vermonty python ice cream flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19983\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vermonty-python-flavor.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vermonty-python-flavor-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vermonty-python-flavor-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Ooh, Vermonty Python (named, of course, for the iconic British comedy troupe Monty Python) sounds like it would have been a really good ice cream. I\\u2019ve come around over the years to enjoying coffee-flavored ice cream.    This one takes the coffee and adds in chocolate cookie crumbs. More ice creams should feature cookie crumbs! That\\u2019s another winning ingredient. As for the \\u201cfudge cows,\\u201d well, those are just weird. They were evidently little pieces of fudge shaped like cows. I guess they capture the bizarre vibe of Monty Python, so it all makes sense.    Mission to Marzipan (2009-2010)    Sweet cream ice cream with almond cookies & a marzipan swirl    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mission-to-marzipan.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"mission to marzipan ben &amp; jerry's flavor graveyard\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19984\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mission-to-marzipan.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mission-to-marzipan-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mission-to-marzipan-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Mission to Marzipan is a cool-sounding name. But understanding this flavor requires actually knowing what marzipan is. I didn\\u2019t know marzipan was actually a real thing. I assumed it was a silly word made up by Ben and Jerry.    Turns out that marzipan is a confection made from sugar, honey, and ground almonds. And this pint mixes a marzipan swirl into a sweet cream ice cream. Sweet cream is eternally one of the best ice cream flavors. This combination was great!    Sugar Plum (1989-1990)    Plum ice cream with a caramel swirl                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sugar-plum-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"sugar plum ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19982\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sugar-plum-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sugar-plum-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sugar-plum-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />    There was a plum ice cream? Seriously? There was a plum ice cream? I love strange flavors, and this one has to be one of the strangest. You never see plum-flavored anything.     Sugar Plum ice cream hit stores in 1989, way before I was buying ice cream. I was a kid and my family was buying gallon containers of generic vanilla back then, so I sadly had no opportunity to give the plum variety a shot. If you ever tried Sugar Plum, please leave a comment letting us know how it was!                                                                    Chocolate Almond Fudge Chip (1993-1996, 1998-1999, 2001-2006)    Coconut ice cream with fudge chips & roasted almonds    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/coconut-almond-fudge-chip.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"coconut almond fudge chip\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19986\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/coconut-almond-fudge-chip.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/coconut-almond-fudge-chip-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/coconut-almond-fudge-chip-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Chocolate Almond Fudge Chip is the flavor that seemingly never dies. It was sent to the graveyard in 1996, brought back two years later, re-graveyarded in 1999, brought back once more two years later, and finally sent back to the graveyard in 2006.    It\\u2019s easy to see why this flavor keeps returning. We all know that coconut and chocolate are a proven combo. I appreciate that B&J used a coconut ice cream base with chocolate mixed in, as opposed to a chocolate base with coconut mixed in. Going all-in on coconut is never a bad idea!    Tennessee Mud (1988-1989)    Coffee ice cream with Amaretto, Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey, and roasted slivered almonds    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tennessee-mud-flavor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"tennessee mud flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19987\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tennessee-mud-flavor.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tennessee-mud-flavor-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tennessee-mud-flavor-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Booze! Not many Ben & Jerry\\u2019s ice creams contain liquor, but Tennessee Mud sure did. It mixed Jack Daniels and Amaretto into a coffee-flavored ice cream base.    I personally don\\u2019t love boozy ice creams, and I guess the public didn\\u2019t go for it, either. You also have to figure that adding Jack Daniels into the mix was cost-prohibitive. They probably weren\\u2019t making as much profit from each pint of Tennessee Mud as they were from other flavors, because that whiskey ain\\u2019t cheap.

The description won me over though. A sweet custard ice cream (that\\u2019s different!) with a caramelized sugar swirl? It sounded fantastic. And it was.    I don\\u2019t know how you go about adding caramelized sugar into an ice cream, but I sure hope Ben and Jerry try it again sometime. This flavor lasted five years, which was a nice run.    Fossil Fuel (2005-2010)    Sweet cream ice cream with chocolate cookie pieces, fudge dinosaurs, and a fudge swirl    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fossil-fuel-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"fossil fuel ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19991\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fossil-fuel-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fossil-fuel-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fossil-fuel-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Fossil Fuel was a fairly simple combination \\u2013 sweet cream ice cream with chocolate and fudge. But that\\u2019s a really appealing pairing. That explains why the flavor survived for five years.    This flavor allowed the company to highlight the important issue of renewable energy. When they retired Fossil Fuel, Ben and Jerry said, \\u201cWe made the decision to lay it to rest in the Flavor Graveyard, because we believe that fossil fuels, whether ice cream or the real thing, belong in the ground!\\u201d    The Wich (2004-2006)    Chewy chocolate chunk cookies with vanilla & chocolately chip ice cream                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-wich-flavor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"the wich flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19993\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-wich-flavor.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-wich-flavor-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-wich-flavor-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />    The Wich was the B&J attempt to recreate the magic of an ice cream sandwich. Chewy cookies mixed into an ice cream is a great idea, but the flavor was still too basic to last.                                                                    Once the company started selling proper ice cream sandwiches, that kinda rendered The Wich unnecessary.    Dastardly Mash (1979-1991)    Chocolate ice cream with pecans, almonds, raisins & chocolate chips    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dastardly-mash.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"dastardly mash ben jerry\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19994\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dastardly-mash.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dastardly-mash-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dastardly-mash-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Here\\u2019s another really old one. Dastardly Mash was created in 1979 and lasted more than a decade. The epitaph poem on its headstone speculates that the raisins may have caused its demise.     That sounds about right! Raisins in ice cream are rare. Their sweet and chewy texture conflicts with the creamy goodness of the ice cream. It would be like putting Skittles or jelly beans in ice cream.    Interestingly, though, I always wondered why my beloved Oatmeal Cookie Chunk didn\\u2019t have raisins. If you\\u2019re going to have raisins in any ice cream, oatmeal cookie is the place for it! It always struck me as odd that the oatmeal ice cream had chocolate chips instead.    Cool Britannia (1989-1990)    Vanilla ice cream with strawberries and fudge-covered shortbread    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cool-britannia-ben-jerry.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"cool britannia ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19995\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cool-britannia-ben-jerry.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cool-britannia-ben-jerry-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cool-britannia-ben-jerry-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Cool Britannia wasn\\u2019t quite cool enough, as it only lasted two years. Strawberries and shortbread do indeed sound like a good pairing.     But again, why add fudge to the mix? This was another flavor where B&J added chocolate unnecessarily, resulting in an inferior flavor.    Economic Crunch (1987)    Vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered almonds, pecans and walnuts    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/economic-crunch-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"economic crunch ben &amp; jerrys flavor graveyard\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19996\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/economic-crunch-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/economic-crunch-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/economic-crunch-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Economic Crunch has to be one of the weirdest ideas Ben & Jerry ever had. After the October 1987 stock market crash, they whipped up this vanilla + nuts concoction and personally delivered it to stock brokers on Wall Street in New York City to cheer them up.    But a stock market crash is such a bizarre thing to commemorate with an ice cream. By that logic, why not create a Pearl Harbor flavor?     Wavy Gravy (1992-2001)    Caramel and cashew Brazil nut ice cream with a chocolate hazelnut fudge swirl & roasted almonds    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wavy-gravy-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"wavy gravy ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19997\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wavy-gravy-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wavy-gravy-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wavy-gravy-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Wavy Gravy is a famous hippie best-known for his appearance at Woodstock. Ben approached him in San Francisco in 1991 with the idea of naming an ice cream after him.    After some trial and error, they settled on a caramel and cashew Brazil nut ice cream with almonds and hazelnut. That\\u2019s a really complex recipe. Perhaps there was too much going on for just one pint. But the flavor lasted for 8 years.    Wavy Gravy ice cream was briefly resurrected in 2005 as the winner of a fan vote, and was again available at scoop shops across the country for a short time.

I\\u2019ve always loved white chocolate, but its flavor can be a bit too sweet when it\\u2019s mixed into an ice cream. I wonder if that\\u2019s what happened with Bovinity Divinity.     This one mixed white and milk chocolate ice creams and cows. Ultimately, it\\u2019s just different types of chocolate, so I\\u2019m guessing it might not have been creative enough to satisfy the public.

This one was modeled after the White Russian and features Kahlua coffee liqueur with coffee ice cream.    Is that too much coffee? Perhaps. The flavor survived for a full decade though, so lots of people enjoyed it. Hmm\\u2026 now I\\u2019m in the mood to order a White Russian at the bar!

The flavor was a little too simple for my taste \\u2013 just vanilla ice cream with crunchy nuts. But at least it was for a good cause.    This is Nuts (2001-2002)    A nutty mix of chocolate & pistachio ice creams with fudge-covered almonds & lightly-roasted pistachios    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-this-is-nuts.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben jerry this is nuts\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20016\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-this-is-nuts.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-this-is-nuts-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-this-is-nuts-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    The name This is Nuts makes it sound as though this flavor has several different types of nuts mixed in. But it\\u2019s actually just pistachios and almonds, with fudge and chocolate ice cream.    I personally love pistachios and would\\u2019ve enjoyed this flavor. But I can see why the general public wouldn\\u2019t have been blown away. Hey, at least Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Pistachio flavor is still on the market!

In this case, Coconut Almond Fudge Chip was paired with New York Super Fudge Chunk.    Both flavors are good on their own. But I\\u2019ve never been a fan of these pairings. I\\u2019d rather have a full pint of the flavors I like instead of splitting a pint between two flavors.    Ethan Almond (1988)    Vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered almonds                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ethan-almond-flavor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ethan almond flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20018\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ethan-almond-flavor.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ethan-almond-flavor-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ethan-almond-flavor-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />    Ethan Almond has to get the prize for simplest flavor in the history of Ben & Jerry\\u2019s. Just vanilla with almonds covered in chocolate.     If you\\u2019re wondering about the strange name, Ethan Almond was a tribute to Ethan Allen, a Revolutionary War patriot and early leader of Vermont. Most people have never heard of him, so this flavor may have been doomed from the start.

This one included cookie dough and was moderately successful, lasting for 7 years.

This was at least a creative flavor design, mixing raspberry, blackberry, and passion fruit.      Devil\\u2019s Food Chocolate Sorbet (1996-2001)    Swirls of light chocolate & dark chocolate sorbet    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/devils-food-chocolate.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"devil's food chocolate sorbet\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20021\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/devils-food-chocolate.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/devils-food-chocolate-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/devils-food-chocolate-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Devil\\u2019s food is one of the richest flavors around, but how would it taste in sorbet form? I never got to find out. Devil\\u2019s Food Chocolate Sorbet stuck around for five years before leaving us in 2001, the same year many other flavors joined the graveyard.    Discontinued Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Flavors That Aren\\u2019t in the Graveyard    Ben & Jerry\\u2019s makes it seem as though all of the abandoned flavors are here in the graveyard. But I was surprised to learn there are dozens of discontinued flavors which don\\u2019t have headstones like the others.     Here\\u2019s a selection of some of the discontinued Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavors you won\\u2019t see in the flavor graveyard:    Brownie Batter. (Brownie batter ice cream with a rich brownie batter swirl) Ahhh, this brings back memories. Brownie Batter ice cream was so delicious! Why\\u2019d they have to stop production? It lasted from 2003 to 2011. I\\u2019m still upset that Ben and Jerry gave up on this one. But at least there\\u2019s a Brownie Batter Core ice cream still on the market.    Festivus. (Brown sugar cinnamon ice cream with gingerbread cookies & a ginger-caramel swirl) This Seinfeld-themed flavor \\u2013 tagline \\u201cThe flavor for the rest of us\\u201d \\u2013 was a Limited Edition batch during the holiday seasons of 2000 and 2001. It later reappeared under two different names: Gingerbread Cookie (2004) and Gingersnap (2009.)    Fred & Ginger. (Ginger ice cream with chocolate bowties) This flavor was created in honor of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, legendary dance and film partners. Unfortunately, it was massively unpopular, and 45 of the 47 scoop shops that carried it did not reorder. Ginger is just a weird flavor for an ice cream, so it was a clever concept, but a bad ice cream. It was here and gone in 1988.                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"597\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-factory-tour-vermont.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben and jerrys factory tour vermont\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20003\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-factory-tour-vermont.jpg 800w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-factory-tour-vermont-450x336.jpg 450w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-factory-tour-vermont-768x573.jpg 768w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\" />    Peanut Butter & Jelly. (Peanut butter ice cream with peanut butter bits and strawberry jelly swirl) PB&J is such an interesting idea for an ice cream flavor. But there\\u2019s a reason why you never see jelly in ice creams from any brand. This was lasted from 1989 to 1990. This flavor used to have a headstone in the graveyard, but for some reason it was removed.    Mocha Walnut. (Mocha ice cream with walnuts) Available only during 1981, this was Ben & Jerry\\u2019s worst-selling flavor of all-time. That especially disappointed Ben, who called it his personal favorite flavor. Perhaps the American public just wasn\\u2019t ready for a coffee-flavored ice cream in the early \\u201980s.                                                                    Coconutterly Fair. (Chocolate ice cream with coconut caramel swirls & a chocolately-covered coconut caramel crunch) Coconutterly Fair, served up from 2011 to 2012, had a name that didn\\u2019t make much sense, and a flavor profile that wasn\\u2019t different enough from some other coconut ice creams Ben and Jerry already had.    Goodbye Yellow Brickle Road. (Chocolate ice cream, peanut butter cookie dough, brickle candy pieces, and white chocolately chunks) In 2008, the company created an Elton John-themed flavor in honor of Sir Elton\\u2019s first-ever concert in Vermont. This Limited Batch was off store shelves by 2009, but it was good while it lasted.     Willie Nelson\\u2019s Country Peach Cobbler. (Peach ice cream with cinnamon-sugar shortbread pieces and a peach swirl) Ooh, I love me some cobbler! This Willie Nelson-inspired flavor sounds positively delightful.     Run Burgundy\\u2019s Scotchy Scotch Scotch. (Butterscotch ice cream with butterscotch swirls) A Ron Burgundy-themed ice cream! This heavy butterscotch flavor honored the famous Will Ferrell newscaster character. That\\u2019s a lot of butterscotch, though.    Tuskegee Chunk. (Peanut butter ice cream with chocolate chunks) It\\u2019s just peanut butter and chocolate! Like a Reese\\u2019s cup! How could Tuskegee Chunk have failed? This one remains a mystery. It was featured from 1989 to 1990.    Cow Power. (Sweet cream ice cream with chocolate cookie pieces, dark chocolatey cows & a chocolate fudge swirl) Cow Power had a lot of cream and a lot of chocolate, but it was pretty basic. This was a limited batch created only for 2012.    Fudge Central. (A soft fudge truffle core surrounded by chocolate & vanilla ice creams with white and dark fudge chips) Fudge Central was one of the three initial \\u201ccore\\u201d ice creams Ben & Jerry created in 2002, along with Peanut Butter Me Up (which appears in the graveyard) and Karamel Sutra (which is still sold today.) Fudge Central had a unique fudge truffle core, but only lasted until 2005.                                                                    Black & Tan. (Cream stout ice cream swirled with chocolate ice cream) Created in 2006, this flavor was designed to capture the essence of the UK beverage Black & Tan, which blends a pale ale and a dark beer. But some Irish consumers reminded Ben and Jerry that Black & Tan was also the name of the notoriously aggressive police force recruited during the Irish War of Independence. B&J apologized and quickly did away with the flavor.    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"700\\\" height=\\\"560\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/discontinued-flavors.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"discontinued flavors\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20009\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/discontinued-flavors.jpg 700w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/discontinued-flavors-450x360.jpg 450w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\" />    Hazed & Confused Core. (Chocolate & hazelnut ice creams with fudge chips and a hazelnut fudge core) The Hazed & Confused Core flavor lasted only from 2014 to 2015. It was the third failed Ben & Jerry\\u2019s hazelnut flavor, following Chocolate Hazelnut Swirl (1988-1991) and Coffee Hazelnut Swirl (2000.)                                                                    Orange & Cream. (Sweet Orange ice cream with swirls of vanilla ice cream) Take an orange creamsicle, remove the stick, and pack it in a pint, and you have Orange & Cream. I would love this flavor, so I\\u2019m not sure why it didn\\u2019t succeed!    Chocolate Orange Fudge. (Chocolate fudge ice cream infused with orange liqueur) I don\\u2019t know about the combination of chocolate and orange. It doesn\\u2019t sound very appealing. Apparently I\\u2019m in the majority with this opinion.    Most of the 2Twisted flavors. In the early 2000s, Ben and Jerry decided to create a series of 2Twisted ice creams, which were basically two different flavors packed together in the same pint.     While two of these offerings remain on the market (Half Baked and Everything But the\\u2026), most of them are long gone. That includes Monkey Wrench (Chunky Monkey + Peanut Butter Cup), Entangled Mints (Mint Chocolate Cookie + Marble Mint Chunk), and Pulp Addiction (Chocolate Orange Fudge + Orange & Cream.)    There are many more abandoned flavors. In addition to all the flavors listed above, the official Ben & Jerry\\u2019s site lists the following flavors as discontinued: Apricot, Banana Walnut, Blond Brownie Sundae, Cantaloupe, Cold Brew Caramel Latte Ice Cream, Egg Nog, Grapefruit Ice, Heath Bar Crunch, Ice Tea Ginseng, Lemon Meringue, Malted Milk Ball, Mango, Maple Grape Nut, Pecan Sticky Buns, Pink Lemonade, Rootbeer Float My Boat, Smores, and Snickerdoodle Cookie.

The tour takes visitors through a viewing window above the manufacturing room. You can see the flavors being produced and mixed in large tanks. The windows are small, and the time is brief, so don\\u2019t expect to see too much.    There\\u2019s also a video presentation describing the history of the company, and a gift shop with all sorts of goodies, including souvenirs and pints of various flavors.    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"740\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-gift-shop-740x600.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben jerry gift shop\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20000\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-gift-shop-740x600.jpg 740w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-gift-shop-450x365.jpg 450w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-gift-shop.jpg 750w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\\\" />                                                                    I felt the tour was worth the $6, even if it was somewhat short. The tour ends with a free sample of a flavor of the day. They tried to fool people with this fake sign stating that today\\u2019s flavor was \\u201cBroccoli Cheddar Chunk.\\u201d    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"437\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/broccoli-cheddar-chunk-437x600.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"broccoli cheddar ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20002\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/broccoli-cheddar-chunk-437x600.jpg 437w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/broccoli-cheddar-chunk-328x450.jpg 328w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/broccoli-cheddar-chunk.jpg 550w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px\\\" />                                                                    Then the tour guide flipped over the sign to reveal the actual flavor of the day, Strawberry Cheesecake. But many of us were bummed that there wasn\\u2019t really a Broccoli Cheddar flavor we could try. Hearing Strawberry Cheesecake after that was honestly a letdown.     There\\u2019s also a scoop shop on the premises. I got a cup of Marshmallow Sky, because I\\u2019d never heard of that flavor before.     It\\u2019s marshmallow ice cream with marshmallow swirl and cookie dough chunks. Plus it has an eye-catching sky blue color. So delicious!    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"435\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/marshmallow-sky-ice-cream-435x600.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"marshmallow sky ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20005\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/marshmallow-sky-ice-cream-435x600.jpg 435w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/marshmallow-sky-ice-cream-327x450.jpg 327w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/marshmallow-sky-ice-cream.jpg 550w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\\\" />                                                                    And that\\u2019s it for my visit to the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s graveyard in Vermont!

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The time frame specified is \"as of the end of 2022.\"\n   - The Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard is a physical location at the company factory in Waterbury, Vermont, and also has an online presence.\n   - The flavor graveyard features headstones with poetic epitaphs for most of the discontinued flavors.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The URL or specific page of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as it appeared at the end of 2022.\n   - The identity of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n   - The photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - The text on the headstone, specifically the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which headstone is in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - Identifying the last line of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard likely has a section dedicated to retired flavors, and each flavor might have its own headstone with a unique rhyme.\n   - The oldest flavor might be one of the original flavors introduced by Ben & Jerry's, such as \"Cherry Garcia\" or \"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.\" However, based on the information from the Quirky Travel Guy article, the oldest flavor in the graveyard could be \"Dastardly Mash,\" which was introduced in 1979.\n   - The last line of the rhyme might be a play on words or a pun related to the flavor's name or characteristics. For example, the epitaph for \"Dastardly Mash\" might include a reference to its nutty and raisin-filled nature.\n   - The photo of the oldest flavor's headstone might show multiple headstones in the background, and we need to identify which one is in the background and read the last line of the rhyme on that headstone.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The Quirky Travel Guy article provided a detailed list of flavors and their introduction dates, suggesting that \"Dastardly Mash\" is one of the oldest flavors in the graveyard, introduced in 1979.\n- Given the playful and humorous nature of Ben & Jerry's branding, it is reasonable to assume that the epitaphs on the headstones are likely to include puns or wordplay related to the flavor's name and characteristics.\n- The photo of the oldest flavor's headstone might show multiple headstones in the background, and we need to carefully identify which one is in the background to read the last line of the rhyme accurately.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Context Length Limitation**: The previous attempts to process the webpage content resulted in errors due to the context length exceeding the model's maximum token limit (32768 tokens).\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: The web surfer did not effectively navigate to the specific section of the page containing the oldest flavor's headstone and the background headstone.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided to the web surfer were not detailed enough to guide it to the exact information needed.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page on the Quirky Travel Guy website.\n- **Step 2**: Scroll down to the section that lists the flavors in the graveyard, starting from the oldest.\n- **Step 3**: Identify the oldest flavor's headstone and locate the photo associated with it.\n- **Step 4**: Zoom in on the photo to clearly see the headstone in the background.\n- **Step 5**: Extract and read the last line of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n- **Step 6**: Provide the last line of the rhyme as the final answer.\n\n### Detailed Instructions for WebSurfer\n\n1. **Navigate to the Page**:\n   - Open the URL: `https://quirkytravelguy.com/ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-ice-cream-vermont-headquarters/`\n\n2. **Scroll to the Oldest Flavors Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the section that lists the flavors in the graveyard, starting from the oldest. Look for the heading \"All the Flavors Currently in the Ben & Jerry’s Flavor Graveyard.\"\n\n3. **Identify the Oldest Flavor's Headstone**:\n   - Find the oldest flavor, which is likely \"Dastardly Mash\" (introduced in 1979).\n   - Locate the photo associated with the oldest flavor's headstone.\n\n4. **Zoom"}

Before presenting all of the discontinued B&J flavors, let\\u2019s answer a few basic questions about how you can visit the factory in Vermont and see the graveyard for yourself.                                                                    Where is the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor graveyard?    The graveyard is located at the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s company factory at 1281 Waterbury-Stowe Rd, Waterbury Village Historic District, VT 05676.     Note \\u2013 it\\u2019s not located at the company headquarters. The Ben & Jerry\\u2019s headquarters are in South Burlington, Vermont. The company factory is in Waterbury.    The graveyard is located in the rear of the factory parking lot. Follow the signs up a slight hill, past a playground, and you\\u2019ll spot the bright purple graveyard gate.    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"681\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ice-cream-headstones.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ice cream headstones\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19990\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ice-cream-headstones.jpg 500w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ice-cream-headstones-330x450.jpg 330w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ice-cream-headstones-441x600.jpg 441w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\\\" />                                                                    How much does it cost to visit the B&J graveyard?    You can visit the graveyard for free. But if you\\u2019d like to take the factory tour to see how the ice cream is made (and you should), that\\u2019ll cost $6 for adults and $5 for kids.     What hours is it open?    The B&J factory is open from 11 am to 6 pm Tuesday through Saturday. It\\u2019s closed Sunday and Monday.     How many flavors are in Ben & Jerry\\u2019s graveyard?    As of this writing, there are 44 flavors with headstones in the flavor graveyard. That number changes over time, as flavors are discontinued and new headstones have to be added to the graveyard.    What does the graveyard look like?    It looks like a literal graveyard, with stone markers for each flavor, although the headstones feature bright and colorful logos and epitaphs in the form of poems.     The graveyard has a striking purple gate at the entrance and a white picket fence surrounding it.    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"796\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben and jerrys flavor graveyard\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19971\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-1.jpg 600w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-1-339x450.jpg 339w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-1-452x600.jpg 452w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\\\" />Front gate of the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor graveyard.                                                                    Is every discontinued Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor in the graveyard?    Nope! This was surprising to learn. There are actually tons of old flavors that, for whatever reason, have not been given a headstone and a spot in the flavor graveyard. Those include Mocha Walnut, Hazed & Confused, and Fred & Ginger (a tribute to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.)     Scroll to the end of the article for a list of more discontinued flavors that aren\\u2019t in the graveyard.                                                                    Are abandoned flavors ever brought back from the flavor graveyard?    Yes, occasionally! In 2022, Ben & Jerry\\u2019s resurrected Dublin Mudslide after a 15-year hiatus and removed it from the flavor graveyard.     Dublin Mudslide features Irish cream liqueur ice cream with chocolate chip cookies and a coffee fudge swirl. Yum! The flavor originally existed from 2005 to 2007.    All the Flavors Currently in the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Flavor Graveyard    Let\\u2019s run down all the flavors currently on display in the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor graveyard (\\u201cOur Dearly De-pinted\\u201d), one by one. I\\u2019ve personally tried many of these flavors. Some of them were among my favorite ice cream flavors of all-time. Some I had no idea had been discontinued!     For each flavor, we\\u2019ll give the official Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor description, followed by the silly and fun epitaph on the headstone in the graveyard.    Oatmeal Cookie Chunk (2004-2012)    Sweet cream cinnamon ice cream with oatmeal cookies & fudge chunks    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"683\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/oatmeal-cookie-chunk.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"oatmeal cookie chunk\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19950\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/oatmeal-cookie-chunk.jpg 500w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/oatmeal-cookie-chunk-329x450.jpg 329w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/oatmeal-cookie-chunk-439x600.jpg 439w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\\\" />                                                                    Let\\u2019s start off with a bang, with my favorite ice cream flavor of all-time. That\\u2019s right, Oatmeal Cookie Chunk is the greatest ice cream flavor in the history of humankind! According to my taste buds, at least.    What made it so great? Start with a sweet cream cinnamon ice cream. That base is packed with flavor and unspeakably delicious. Then add in chocolate chunks and huge swaths of oatmeal cookie dough, and you have a flawless combination.    Backstory: My entire life, I used to wonder why cookie dough ice cream was just boring vanilla ice cream with tiny little unsatisfying balls of cookie dough tossed in. Why, I wondered, couldn\\u2019t they swirl in huge swaths of the cookie dough? Why couldn\\u2019t half the container be cookie dough swirls?    And then I discovered Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Oatmeal Cookie Chunk, and its robust cookie dough swaths. And my life was changed. Suddenly, anything was possible in the world of ice cream!    This was one of the longest-lasting flavors in the graveyard, remaining in stores for 8 years before it was discontinued.                                                                     The only reason I\\u2019m not depressed about its absence is that B&J now has a similar flavor, Oat of This Swirled, which features oatmeal cookie dough swirled into a brown sugar ice cream. It\\u2019s similar enough to give me that oatmeal cookie fix I need.    KaBerry KaBoom (2001)    Strawberry & blueberry ice creams with fudge-covered cracklin\\u2019 candy & a blueberry swirl    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"793\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kaberry-kaboom.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"kaberry kaboom flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19951\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kaberry-kaboom.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kaberry-kaboom-312x450.jpg 312w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kaberry-kaboom-416x600.jpg 416w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Yikes. It\\u2019s not hard to see why this one failed! Cracklin\\u2019 candies in ice cream? I could see that maybe working if done correctly. But covering the candy in chocolate is definitely not the way to do it. Imagine Nerds or Skittles covered in chocolate. Nobody wants that!    Also, strawberry and blueberry together is just way too sweet. I never got to try this flavor, but I can totally get why it didn\\u2019t survive even one full year.    Schweddy Balls (2011)    Vanilla ice cream with a hint of rum, loaded with fudge-covered rum & malt balls    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/schweddy-balls-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"schweddy balls ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19953\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/schweddy-balls-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/schweddy-balls-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/schweddy-balls-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Only Ben and Jerry are crazy enough to conceive an ice cream flavor around a Saturday Night Live sketch from a decade earlier.     That would be the famous 1998 sketch featuring Alec Baldwin as Pete Schweddy, a baker whose \\u201cSchweddy balls\\u201d were a favorite holiday dessert.    Schweddy Balls was a limited edition holiday batch for 2011, so it was never expected to live forever. Rum balls in a vanilla ice cream doesn\\u2019t sound like a combination that could last for years anyway. It was just a novelty flavor.    You can see that someone left roses at this headstone. That\\u2019s just silly enough to be funny.    Dave Matthews Band\\u2019s Magic Brownies (2007-2011)    Black raspberry ice cream swirled with sweet cream ice cream & fudgy brownies    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dave-matthews-band-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"dave matthews band ben &amp; jerrys ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19955\\\" style=\\\"width:550px;height:800px\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dave-matthews-band-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dave-matthews-band-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dave-matthews-band-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    The Dave Matthews Band was one of the biggest bands in the world in the early 2000s, and they shared a similar worldview with Ben & Jerry\\u2019s. Hence, a collab was born.    Magic Brownies was actually the second Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor in honor of DMB. I distinctly remember the first, called One Sweet Whirled (after the DMB tune \\u201cOne Sweet World\\u201d). That flavor arrived in 2002 and featured caramel and coffee ice creams with marshmallow swirls and coffee-flavored chocolate chips.     As a huge DMB fan, I was compelled to buy One Sweet Whirled, even though I don\\u2019t like coffee. It was decent, but only lasted until 2004.                                                                     Three years later, B&J decided to try another DMB flavor, this time with a raspberry kick. I don\\u2019t love raspberry in ice cream, so I never got around to trying the Magic Brownies.     Fresh Georgia Peach (1986-1991)    Vanilla ice cream with fresh Georgia peaches    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-graveyard-peach.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben jerrys graveyard peach\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19957\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-graveyard-peach.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-graveyard-peach-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-graveyard-peach-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Here\\u2019s one of the oldest flavors in the graveyard. Georgia peach was created in 1986, and it was very simple. Just vanilla ice cream with peaches. That was enough to last for five years.    I absolutely love peach ice cream, and would\\u2019ve been all over this flavor if I\\u2019d had the chance, but it was before my ice cream-buying time. B&J later created a Willie Nelson Peach Cobbler flavor that added shortbread into the mix.    What a Cluster (aka Clusterfluff) (2011-2014)    Peanut butter ice cream with caramel cluster pieces, marshmallow swirls & peanut buttery swirls    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clusterfluff-ben-jerrys.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"clusterfluff ben jerrys\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19958\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clusterfluff-ben-jerrys.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clusterfluff-ben-jerrys-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clusterfluff-ben-jerrys-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Here\\u2019s the other flavor in the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor graveyard that I miss dearly. What a Cluster is another of my all-time fave ice cream flavors.     It\\u2019s basically peanut butter and marshmallow, which is an incredible combination, with the added sweetness and crunchy texture of caramel clusters. It was modeled after fluffernutter. I was so bummed when this flavor went away!    Interesting fact \\u2013 this one was originally called Clusterfluff. That was a fun and slightly edgy play on words. And then shortly after, with no announcement or explanation, they changed it to the much more boring What a Cluster. Did Ben & Jerry\\u2019s succumb to consumer complaints about the name? Who knows, but that name change always bothered me.    Peanuts! Popcorn!

Gotta give kudos to Ben and Jerry for trying new things. But it didn\\u2019t quite work.     I have to say, the idea of peanuts and popcorn in ice cream doesn\\u2019t sound that appetizing initially. But when you read further, and realize that the popcorn was actually caramel popcorn, and that it was covered in white chocolate, and the peanuts were covered in toffee\\u2026 that actually sounds tasty!    Evidently, customers didn\\u2019t think so, as it disappeared in 2000, the same year it hit the market.

Plain old neapolitan isn\\u2019t really going to excite the typical B&J buyer. The company understood that and changed the neapolitan formula.    Instead of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry, Neapolitan Dynamite offered a pairing of Cherry Garcia and Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice creams instead. I never tried this one, but enough fans of the movie bought it that it hung around for four years.    Oh Pear (1997)    Fresh pear ice cream with a hint of almond and a light fudge swirl    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-pear-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben &amp; jerry's pear ice cream \\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19962\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-pear-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-pear-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-pear-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    One of the great mysteries of life for me is why there are so many peach-flavored foods and drinks, and so few pear-flavored ones. I love pear and never understood why there isn\\u2019t pear cobbler, pear-flavored soda, pear ice cream, pear yogurt, and all the rest.    Imagine my surprise upon learning that Ben & Jerry\\u2019s once produced a pear ice cream! But it was here for such a short time, I blinked and missed it.    Reading the description, though, I\\u2019m not sure how good it would\\u2019ve been. Ben & Jerry have this unfortunate compulsion to add chocolate to flavors that don\\u2019t need it (like Oatmeal Cookie Chunk.) And here we see that their pear ice cream actually had a fudge swirl. WTF, B & J?    I think the way to make a pear flavor work would\\u2019ve been to keep the mix-ins to a minimum. A few shaved almonds are fine, and maybe some cinnamon or brown sugar to punch it up a little. That\\u2019s all you need.     Holy Cannoli (1997-1998)    Creamy Ricotta and pistachio ice cream with chocolate-covered cannolis and roasted pistachio    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/holy-cannoli-flavor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"holy cannoli flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19964\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/holy-cannoli-flavor.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/holy-cannoli-flavor-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/holy-cannoli-flavor-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    I wonder if the reason Holy Cannoli never took off is that many people don\\u2019t know what cannolis are. It\\u2019s not a common dessert in most parts of the country.     The cannoli is a delicious Italian pastry stuffed with a creamy filling. I actually just had my first cannoli recently at Mike\\u2019s Pastry in the Cambridge neighborhood of Boston.     I\\u2019d totally buy Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Holy Cannoli if it came out today, but I never tried it back in the day.                                                                    The epitaph speculates that perhaps people were turned off by the pistachios, but I\\u2019m not so sure about that. Ben & Jerry\\u2019s has a Pistachio flavor that is still going strong.     I think that cannolis were just too unfamiliar, or the idea of Ricotta cheese in an ice cream didn\\u2019t sound appetizing enough.

But a glimpse at the ingredient list shows that there\\u2019s no actual cake in there \\u2013 just ice cream made to taste like cake batter. There aren\\u2019t even any rainbow sprinkles \\u2013 just a swirl of chocolate frosting.    The company did later make an actual \\u201cBirthday Cake\\u201d flavor that was more in tune with the kind of cake ice creams people are craving these days.

A traditional Boston Cream Pie is delicious, and this one captured its essence successfully, with the fudge and the pasty cream swirl.     Sad to see this one go, but at least it had a respectable six-year run!    UPDATE: Last year, Ben & Jerry\\u2019s released Bossin\\u2019 Cream Pie, an updated version of this flavor. It\\u2019s basically the same, except the layer of chocolate and chips are right on the top, rather than swirled in. I tried it and sadly didn\\u2019t love it, because the chocolate is hard and crunchy, rather than smooth and soft, as it is on the actual pie itself.

In the meantime, let\\u2019s mourn the loss of Wild Maine Blueberry ice cream. This was a rare Ben & Jerry\\u2019s offering that featured a fruit puree as part of the blend. We haven\\u2019t really seen other purees since then, so evidently customers made their voices heard that it wasn\\u2019t a winning formula.     Peanut Butter Me Up (2002-2003)    A peanut butter caramel core surrounded by peanut butter & chocolate ice creams with fudge chips                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanut-butter-me-up-ben-jerry.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"peanut butter me up ben jerry\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19968\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanut-butter-me-up-ben-jerry.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanut-butter-me-up-ben-jerry-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanut-butter-me-up-ben-jerry-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />    A peanut butter flavor that didn\\u2019t sell?

It sounds especially delicious \\u2013 peanut butter and chocolate ice creams with a peanut butter caramel core.                                                                    Maybe back in 2002, Ben & Jerry\\u2019s hadn\\u2019t yet mastered the \\u201ccore\\u201d ice cream techniques. These days, they have lots of flavors with a core filling, but they didn\\u2019t have many two decades ago. In fact, this was one of the first three \\u201ccore\\u201d ice creams the company created, which all debuted in 2002. Perhaps consumers weren\\u2019t yet ready for that type of dairy innovation.     Or maybe the caramel part was a turnoff. Caramel really doesn\\u2019t belong here. Ben and Jerry should hire someone to edit their flavor combinations before they hit the market!    Chocolate Comfort (1999)    Chocolate truffle ice low fat ice cream swirled with white chocolate low fat ice cream    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chocolate-comfort.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"chocolate comfort\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19969\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chocolate-comfort.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chocolate-comfort-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chocolate-comfort-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    You have to really screw something up to create a chocolate-flavored ice cream that people don\\u2019t like. So how did Ben & Jerry do it?    Well, the main crime was attempting a low-fat ice cream. If you\\u2019ve ever checked the label on a pint of Ben & Jerry\\u2019s you know that it\\u2019s absolutely loaded with calories and fat. We just accept that as the tradeoff for all that flavor.    This was an attempt to find out if there was a market for a lower-fat flavor, and apparently there was not. But I also think that making it a \\u201cchocolate truffle\\u201d flavor was a bad idea. I know truffles are all the rage, but a lot of us just don\\u2019t like truffle flavor and would never buy a flavor like this.

I\\u2019ve never seen such a flavor anywhere. Perhaps there\\u2019s a reason for that. If B&J couldn\\u2019t make it work, maybe no one can.    Who is Miz Jelena, by the way? I have no idea. I found a company called \\u201cMiz Jelena\\u2019s Homemade Southern Cookin'\\u201d that incorporated in 1992, the same year this ice cream hit the market, so perhaps there was a connection. Maybe Ben & Jerry had plans to create a whole line of southern-themed Miz Jelena ice creams if this one worked out. Alas, it did not.    Turtle Soup (2006-2010)    Vanilla ice cream with fudge and caramel cashews & a caramel swirl    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/turtle-soup-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"turtle soup ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19974\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/turtle-soup-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/turtle-soup-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/turtle-soup-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Turtle Soup survived for four years, but I\\u2019ll be honest: I could never get past the name. \\u201cTurtle soup\\u201d conjures up images of a southern stew with veggies and turtle bits. The name is so off-putting. I cringe every time I read it.    Still, if the ice cream had featured lots of delicious mix-ins, I would\\u2019ve overlooked the name and given it a try. But it was literally just vanilla ice cream with nuts, fudge, and caramel. It\\u2019s hard to imagine a less inventive combination.    Pina Colada (2013)    Coconut ice cream with pineapple chunks                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pina-colada-ben-jerry.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"pina colada - ben &amp; jerry's graveyard\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19975\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pina-colada-ben-jerry.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pina-colada-ben-jerry-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pina-colada-ben-jerry-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />    Pineapple chunks mixed into coconut ice cream? Sign me up! Pina Colada ice cream was absolutely delicious. I wish this flavor had become a staple of the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s product line, but they chose to make it a Limited Batch, available only during summer 2013.                                                                    Interesting fact: I loved this ice cream during its brief run. When it went off the market, I was forced to look around to find other brands that had similar flavors. I finally located Haagen Dazs\\u2019 Pineapple Coconut, which has remained one of my favorites for the past several years.     So Ben & Jerry inadvertently created more business for their rival, by getting me addicted to a flavor and then immediately pulling it off the market. That\\u2019s probably not what they had in mind!    P.S. Pineapple lovers may want to check out my article about visiting the Dole Plantation in Hawaii.

They\\u2019re similar to Moon Pies, the beloved product of Chattanooga, Tennessee. But Whoopie Pies tend to be softer and feature chocolate, while Moon Pies can have various flavors.    Ben and Jerry chose to give their Whoopie Pie ice cream a clever name that recalls the Newlywed Game. And they opted to feature a chocolate ice cream base with marshmallow and devil\\u2019s food cookies swirled in. That sounds tasty! Every ice cream I\\u2019ve ever tried that features marshmallow has been delicious. I wish I\\u2019d gotten a chance to try this one.

I don\\u2019t ever remember seeing it in stores, but Chocolate Peppermint Crunch had a solid four-year run.    Mint chocolate chip ice cream is everywhere, but Chocolate Peppermint is more unique and sounds more delicious. Hopefully this one will be resurrected and find itself back in stores someday!

Add in fudge-covered honeycomb candy nuggets, and I can\\u2019t imagine why everyone didn\\u2019t love this flavor.    Honey I\\u2019m Home may reside in the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s graveyard, but the company recently created a flavor called Home Sweet Honeycomb, which is almost the exact same recipe.

Look at the first ingredient on the list: \\u201cRich milk chocolate cashew Brazil-nut butter ice cream.\\u201d All of that is one ingredient? It\\u2019s ice cream that tastes like chocolate, cashews, and nut butter?     If consumers can\\u2019t make sense of what the flavor is, they\\u2019re certainly not going to buy it. I do think this might\\u2019ve been a tasty flavor though. Macadamia nuts covered in white and dark fudge sounds wondrous.

Especially in the case of That\\u2019s My Jam, as the entire core of the pint is raspberry. You have to really like that particular berry to enjoy this.    Perhaps Ben and Jerry should wave the white flag, and forever stop trying to work raspberry into a flavor that people will actually buy.

I\\u2019ve come around over the years to enjoying coffee-flavored ice cream.    This one takes the coffee and adds in chocolate cookie crumbs. More ice creams should feature cookie crumbs! That\\u2019s another winning ingredient. As for the \\u201cfudge cows,\\u201d well, those are just weird. They were evidently little pieces of fudge shaped like cows. I guess they capture the bizarre vibe of Monty Python, so it all makes sense.

But understanding this flavor requires actually knowing what marzipan is. I didn\\u2019t know marzipan was actually a real thing. I assumed it was a silly word made up by Ben and Jerry.    Turns out that marzipan is a confection made from sugar, honey, and ground almonds. And this pint mixes a marzipan swirl into a sweet cream ice cream. Sweet cream is eternally one of the best ice cream flavors. This combination was great!

Seriously? There was a plum ice cream? I love strange flavors, and this one has to be one of the strangest. You never see plum-flavored anything.     Sugar Plum ice cream hit stores in 1989, way before I was buying ice cream.

It was sent to the graveyard in 1996, brought back two years later, re-graveyarded in 1999, brought back once more two years later, and finally sent back to the graveyard in 2006.    It\\u2019s easy to see why this flavor keeps returning. We all know that coconut and chocolate are a proven combo. I appreciate that B&J used a coconut ice cream base with chocolate mixed in, as opposed to a chocolate base with coconut mixed in. Going all-in on coconut is never a bad idea!    Tennessee Mud (1988-1989)    Coffee ice cream with Amaretto, Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey, and roasted slivered almonds    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tennessee-mud-flavor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"tennessee mud flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19987\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tennessee-mud-flavor.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tennessee-mud-flavor-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tennessee-mud-flavor-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Booze! Not many Ben & Jerry\\u2019s ice creams contain liquor, but Tennessee Mud sure did. It mixed Jack Daniels and Amaretto into a coffee-flavored ice cream base.    I personally don\\u2019t love boozy ice creams, and I guess the public didn\\u2019t go for it, either. You also have to figure that adding Jack Daniels into the mix was cost-prohibitive. They probably weren\\u2019t making as much profit from each pint of Tennessee Mud as they were from other flavors, because that whiskey ain\\u2019t cheap.     Creme Brulee (2007-2012)    Sweet custard ice cream with a caramelized sugar swirl    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/creme-brulee-ben-jerry.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"creme brulee ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19988\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/creme-brulee-ben-jerry.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/creme-brulee-ben-jerry-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/creme-brulee-ben-jerry-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    I remember buying the Creme Brulee flavor, even though I wasn\\u2019t entirely sure what creme brulee was. The description won me over though. A sweet custard ice cream (that\\u2019s different!) with a caramelized sugar swirl? It sounded fantastic. And it was.    I don\\u2019t know how you go about adding caramelized sugar into an ice cream, but I sure hope Ben and Jerry try it again sometime. This flavor lasted five years, which was a nice run.    Fossil Fuel (2005-2010)    Sweet cream ice cream with chocolate cookie pieces, fudge dinosaurs, and a fudge swirl    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fossil-fuel-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"fossil fuel ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19991\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fossil-fuel-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fossil-fuel-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fossil-fuel-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Fossil Fuel was a fairly simple combination \\u2013 sweet cream ice cream with chocolate and fudge. But that\\u2019s a really appealing pairing. That explains why the flavor survived for five years.    This flavor allowed the company to highlight the important issue of renewable energy. When they retired Fossil Fuel, Ben and Jerry said, \\u201cWe made the decision to lay it to rest in the Flavor Graveyard, because we believe that fossil fuels, whether ice cream or the real thing, belong in the ground!\\u201d    The Wich (2004-2006)    Chewy chocolate chunk cookies with vanilla & chocolately chip ice cream                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-wich-flavor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"the wich flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19993\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-wich-flavor.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-wich-flavor-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-wich-flavor-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />    The Wich was the B&J attempt to recreate the magic of an ice cream sandwich. Chewy cookies mixed into an ice cream is a great idea, but the flavor was still too basic to last.                                                                    Once the company started selling proper ice cream sandwiches, that kinda rendered The Wich unnecessary.    Dastardly Mash (1979-1991)    Chocolate ice cream with pecans, almonds, raisins & chocolate chips    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dastardly-mash.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"dastardly mash ben jerry\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19994\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dastardly-mash.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dastardly-mash-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dastardly-mash-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Here\\u2019s another really old one. Dastardly Mash was created in 1979 and lasted more than a decade. The epitaph poem on its headstone speculates that the raisins may have caused its demise.     That sounds about right! Raisins in ice cream are rare. Their sweet and chewy texture conflicts with the creamy goodness of the ice cream. It would be like putting Skittles or jelly beans in ice cream.    Interestingly, though, I always wondered why my beloved Oatmeal Cookie Chunk didn\\u2019t have raisins. If you\\u2019re going to have raisins in any ice cream, oatmeal cookie is the place for it! It always struck me as odd that the oatmeal ice cream had chocolate chips instead.    Cool Britannia (1989-1990)    Vanilla ice cream with strawberries and fudge-covered shortbread    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cool-britannia-ben-jerry.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"cool britannia ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19995\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cool-britannia-ben-jerry.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cool-britannia-ben-jerry-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cool-britannia-ben-jerry-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Cool Britannia wasn\\u2019t quite cool enough, as it only lasted two years. Strawberries and shortbread do indeed sound like a good pairing.     But again, why add fudge to the mix? This was another flavor where B&J added chocolate unnecessarily, resulting in an inferior flavor.    Economic Crunch (1987)    Vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered almonds, pecans and walnuts    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/economic-crunch-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"economic crunch ben &amp; jerrys flavor graveyard\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19996\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/economic-crunch-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/economic-crunch-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/economic-crunch-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Economic Crunch has to be one of the weirdest ideas Ben & Jerry ever had. After the October 1987 stock market crash, they whipped up this vanilla + nuts concoction and personally delivered it to stock brokers on Wall Street in New York City to cheer them up.    But a stock market crash is such a bizarre thing to commemorate with an ice cream. By that logic, why not create a Pearl Harbor flavor?     Wavy Gravy (1992-2001)    Caramel and cashew Brazil nut ice cream with a chocolate hazelnut fudge swirl & roasted almonds    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wavy-gravy-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"wavy gravy ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19997\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wavy-gravy-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wavy-gravy-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wavy-gravy-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Wavy Gravy is a famous hippie best-known for his appearance at Woodstock. Ben approached him in San Francisco in 1991 with the idea of naming an ice cream after him.    After some trial and error, they settled on a caramel and cashew Brazil nut ice cream with almonds and hazelnut. That\\u2019s a really complex recipe. Perhaps there was too much going on for just one pint. But the flavor lasted for 8 years.    Wavy Gravy ice cream was briefly resurrected in 2005 as the winner of a fan vote, and was again available at scoop shops across the country for a short time.

I\\u2019ve always loved white chocolate, but its flavor can be a bit too sweet when it\\u2019s mixed into an ice cream. I wonder if that\\u2019s what happened with Bovinity Divinity.     This one mixed white and milk chocolate ice creams and cows. Ultimately, it\\u2019s just different types of chocolate, so I\\u2019m guessing it might not have been creative enough to satisfy the public.

This one was modeled after the White Russian and features Kahlua coffee liqueur with coffee ice cream.    Is that too much coffee? Perhaps. The flavor survived for a full decade though, so lots of people enjoyed it. Hmm\\u2026 now I\\u2019m in the mood to order a White Russian at the bar!

The flavor was a little too simple for my taste \\u2013 just vanilla ice cream with crunchy nuts. But at least it was for a good cause.    This is Nuts (2001-2002)    A nutty mix of chocolate & pistachio ice creams with fudge-covered almonds & lightly-roasted pistachios    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-this-is-nuts.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben jerry this is nuts\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20016\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-this-is-nuts.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-this-is-nuts-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-this-is-nuts-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    The name This is Nuts makes it sound as though this flavor has several different types of nuts mixed in. But it\\u2019s actually just pistachios and almonds, with fudge and chocolate ice cream.    I personally love pistachios and would\\u2019ve enjoyed this flavor. But I can see why the general public wouldn\\u2019t have been blown away. Hey, at least Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Pistachio flavor is still on the market!

In this case, Coconut Almond Fudge Chip was paired with New York Super Fudge Chunk.    Both flavors are good on their own. But I\\u2019ve never been a fan of these pairings.

Just vanilla with almonds covered in chocolate.     If you\\u2019re wondering about the strange name, Ethan Almond was a tribute to Ethan Allen, a Revolutionary War patriot and early leader of Vermont. Most people have never heard of him, so this flavor may have been doomed from the start.

Discontinued Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Flavors That Aren\\u2019t in the Graveyard    Ben & Jerry\\u2019s makes it seem as though all of the abandoned flavors are here in the graveyard. But I was surprised to learn there are dozens of discontinued flavors which don\\u2019t have headstones like the others.     Here\\u2019s a selection of some of the discontinued Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavors you won\\u2019t see in the flavor graveyard:    Brownie Batter. (Brownie batter ice cream with a rich brownie batter swirl) Ahhh, this brings back memories. Brownie Batter ice cream was so delicious! Why\\u2019d they have to stop production? It lasted from 2003 to 2011. I\\u2019m still upset that Ben and Jerry gave up on this one. But at least there\\u2019s a Brownie Batter Core ice cream still on the market.    Festivus. (Brown sugar cinnamon ice cream with gingerbread cookies & a ginger-caramel swirl) This Seinfeld-themed flavor \\u2013 tagline \\u201cThe flavor for the rest of us\\u201d \\u2013 was a Limited Edition batch during the holiday seasons of 2000 and 2001. It later reappeared under two different names: Gingerbread Cookie (2004) and Gingersnap (2009.)    Fred & Ginger. (Ginger ice cream with chocolate bowties) This flavor was created in honor of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, legendary dance and film partners. Unfortunately, it was massively unpopular, and 45 of the 47 scoop shops that carried it did not reorder. Ginger is just a weird flavor for an ice cream, so it was a clever concept, but a bad ice cream. It was here and gone in 1988.                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"597\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-factory-tour-vermont.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben and jerrys factory tour vermont\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20003\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-factory-tour-vermont.jpg 800w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-factory-tour-vermont-450x336.jpg 450w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-factory-tour-vermont-768x573.jpg 768w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\" />    Peanut Butter & Jelly. (Peanut butter ice cream with peanut butter bits and strawberry jelly swirl) PB&J is such an interesting idea for an ice cream flavor. But there\\u2019s a reason why you never see jelly in ice creams from any brand. This was lasted from 1989 to 1990. This flavor used to have a headstone in the graveyard, but for some reason it was removed.    Mocha Walnut. (Mocha ice cream with walnuts) Available only during 1981, this was Ben & Jerry\\u2019s worst-selling flavor of all-time. That especially disappointed Ben, who called it his personal favorite flavor. Perhaps the American public just wasn\\u2019t ready for a coffee-flavored ice cream in the early \\u201980s.                                                                    Coconutterly Fair. (Chocolate ice cream with coconut caramel swirls & a chocolately-covered coconut caramel crunch) Coconutterly Fair, served up from 2011 to 2012, had a name that didn\\u2019t make much sense, and a flavor profile that wasn\\u2019t different enough from some other coconut ice creams Ben and Jerry already had.    Goodbye Yellow Brickle Road. (Chocolate ice cream, peanut butter cookie dough, brickle candy pieces, and white chocolately chunks) In 2008, the company created an Elton John-themed flavor in honor of Sir Elton\\u2019s first-ever concert in Vermont. This Limited Batch was off store shelves by 2009, but it was good while it lasted.     Willie Nelson\\u2019s Country Peach Cobbler. (Peach ice cream with cinnamon-sugar shortbread pieces and a peach swirl) Ooh, I love me some cobbler! This Willie Nelson-inspired flavor sounds positively delightful.     Run Burgundy\\u2019s Scotchy Scotch Scotch. (Butterscotch ice cream with butterscotch swirls) A Ron Burgundy-themed ice cream! This heavy butterscotch flavor honored the famous Will Ferrell newscaster character. That\\u2019s a lot of butterscotch, though.    Tuskegee Chunk. (Peanut butter ice cream with chocolate chunks) It\\u2019s just peanut butter and chocolate! Like a Reese\\u2019s cup! How could Tuskegee Chunk have failed? This one remains a mystery. It was featured from 1989 to 1990.    Cow Power. (Sweet cream ice cream with chocolate cookie pieces, dark chocolatey cows & a chocolate fudge swirl) Cow Power had a lot of cream and a lot of chocolate, but it was pretty basic. This was a limited batch created only for 2012.    Fudge Central. (A soft fudge truffle core surrounded by chocolate & vanilla ice creams with white and dark fudge chips) Fudge Central was one of the three initial \\u201ccore\\u201d ice creams Ben & Jerry created in 2002, along with Peanut Butter Me Up (which appears in the graveyard) and Karamel Sutra (which is still sold today.) Fudge Central had a unique fudge truffle core, but only lasted until 2005.                                                                    Black & Tan. (Cream stout ice cream swirled with chocolate ice cream) Created in 2006, this flavor was designed to capture the essence of the UK beverage Black & Tan, which blends a pale ale and a dark beer. But some Irish consumers reminded Ben and Jerry that Black & Tan was also the name of the notoriously aggressive police force recruited during the Irish War of Independence. B&J apologized and quickly did away with the flavor.    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"700\\\" height=\\\"560\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/discontinued-flavors.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"discontinued flavors\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20009\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/discontinued-flavors.jpg 700w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/discontinued-flavors-450x360.jpg 450w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\" />    Hazed & Confused Core. (Chocolate & hazelnut ice creams with fudge chips and a hazelnut fudge core) The Hazed & Confused Core flavor lasted only from 2014 to 2015. It was the third failed Ben & Jerry\\u2019s hazelnut flavor, following Chocolate Hazelnut Swirl (1988-1991) and Coffee Hazelnut Swirl (2000.)                                                                    Orange & Cream. (Sweet Orange ice cream with swirls of vanilla ice cream) Take an orange creamsicle, remove the stick, and pack it in a pint, and you have Orange & Cream. I would love this flavor, so I\\u2019m not sure why it didn\\u2019t succeed!    Chocolate Orange Fudge. (Chocolate fudge ice cream infused with orange liqueur) I don\\u2019t know about the combination of chocolate and orange. It doesn\\u2019t sound very appealing. Apparently I\\u2019m in the majority with this opinion.    Most of the 2Twisted flavors. In the early 2000s, Ben and Jerry decided to create a series of 2Twisted ice creams, which were basically two different flavors packed together in the same pint.     While two of these offerings remain on the market (Half Baked and Everything But the\\u2026), most of them are long gone. That includes Monkey Wrench (Chunky Monkey + Peanut Butter Cup), Entangled Mints (Mint Chocolate Cookie + Marble Mint Chunk), and Pulp Addiction (Chocolate Orange Fudge + Orange & Cream.)    There are many more abandoned flavors. In addition to all the flavors listed above, the official Ben & Jerry\\u2019s site lists the following flavors as discontinued: Apricot, Banana Walnut, Blond Brownie Sundae, Cantaloupe, Cold Brew Caramel Latte Ice Cream, Egg Nog, Grapefruit Ice, Heath Bar Crunch, Ice Tea Ginseng, Lemon Meringue, Malted Milk Ball, Mango, Maple Grape Nut, Pecan Sticky Buns, Pink Lemonade, Rootbeer Float My Boat, Smores, and Snickerdoodle Cookie.

The tour takes visitors through a viewing window above the manufacturing room. You can see the flavors being produced and mixed in large tanks. The windows are small, and the time is brief, so don\\u2019t expect to see too much.    There\\u2019s also a video presentation describing the history of the company, and a gift shop with all sorts of goodies, including souvenirs and pints of various flavors.    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"740\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-gift-shop-740x600.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben jerry gift shop\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20000\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-gift-shop-740x600.jpg 740w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-gift-shop-450x365.jpg 450w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-gift-shop.jpg 750w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\\\" />                                                                    I felt the tour was worth the $6, even if it was somewhat short. The tour ends with a free sample of a flavor of the day. They tried to fool people with this fake sign stating that today\\u2019s flavor was \\u201cBroccoli Cheddar Chunk.\\u201d    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"437\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/broccoli-cheddar-chunk-437x600.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"broccoli cheddar ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20002\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/broccoli-cheddar-chunk-437x600.jpg 437w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/broccoli-cheddar-chunk-328x450.jpg 328w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/broccoli-cheddar-chunk.jpg 550w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px\\\" />                                                                    Then the tour guide flipped over the sign to reveal the actual flavor of the day, Strawberry Cheesecake. But many of us were bummed that there wasn\\u2019t really a Broccoli Cheddar flavor we could try. Hearing Strawberry Cheesecake after that was honestly a letdown.     There\\u2019s also a scoop shop on the premises. I got a cup of Marshmallow Sky, because I\\u2019d never heard of that flavor before.     It\\u2019s marshmallow ice cream with marshmallow swirl and cookie dough chunks. Plus it has an eye-catching sky blue color. So delicious!    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"435\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/marshmallow-sky-ice-cream-435x600.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"marshmallow sky ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20005\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/marshmallow-sky-ice-cream-435x600.jpg 435w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/marshmallow-sky-ice-cream-327x450.jpg 327w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/marshmallow-sky-ice-cream.jpg 550w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\\\" />                                                                    And that\\u2019s it for my visit to the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s graveyard in Vermont!

Before presenting all of the discontinued B&J flavors, let\\u2019s answer a few basic questions about how you can visit the factory in Vermont and see the graveyard for yourself.                                                                    Where is the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor graveyard?    The graveyard is located at the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s company factory at 1281 Waterbury-Stowe Rd, Waterbury Village Historic District, VT 05676.     Note \\u2013 it\\u2019s not located at the company headquarters. The Ben & Jerry\\u2019s headquarters are in South Burlington, Vermont. The company factory is in Waterbury.    The graveyard is located in the rear of the factory parking lot. Follow the signs up a slight hill, past a playground, and you\\u2019ll spot the bright purple graveyard gate.    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"681\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ice-cream-headstones.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ice cream headstones\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19990\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ice-cream-headstones.jpg 500w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ice-cream-headstones-330x450.jpg 330w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ice-cream-headstones-441x600.jpg 441w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\\\" />                                                                    How much does it cost to visit the B&J graveyard?    You can visit the graveyard for free. But if you\\u2019d like to take the factory tour to see how the ice cream is made (and you should), that\\u2019ll cost $6 for adults and $5 for kids.     What hours is it open?    The B&J factory is open from 11 am to 6 pm Tuesday through Saturday. It\\u2019s closed Sunday and Monday.     How many flavors are in Ben & Jerry\\u2019s graveyard?    As of this writing, there are 44 flavors with headstones in the flavor graveyard. That number changes over time, as flavors are discontinued and new headstones have to be added to the graveyard.    What does the graveyard look like?    It looks like a literal graveyard, with stone markers for each flavor, although the headstones feature bright and colorful logos and epitaphs in the form of poems.     The graveyard has a striking purple gate at the entrance and a white picket fence surrounding it.    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"796\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben and jerrys flavor graveyard\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19971\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-1.jpg 600w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-1-339x450.jpg 339w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-1-452x600.jpg 452w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\\\" />Front gate of the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor graveyard.                                                                    Is every discontinued Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor in the graveyard?    Nope! This was surprising to learn. There are actually tons of old flavors that, for whatever reason, have not been given a headstone and a spot in the flavor graveyard. Those include Mocha Walnut, Hazed & Confused, and Fred & Ginger (a tribute to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.)     Scroll to the end of the article for a list of more discontinued flavors that aren\\u2019t in the graveyard.                                                                    Are abandoned flavors ever brought back from the flavor graveyard?    Yes, occasionally! In 2022, Ben & Jerry\\u2019s resurrected Dublin Mudslide after a 15-year hiatus and removed it from the flavor graveyard.     Dublin Mudslide features Irish cream liqueur ice cream with chocolate chip cookies and a coffee fudge swirl. Yum! The flavor originally existed from 2005 to 2007.    All the Flavors Currently in the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Flavor Graveyard    Let\\u2019s run down all the flavors currently on display in the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor graveyard (\\u201cOur Dearly De-pinted\\u201d), one by one. I\\u2019ve personally tried many of these flavors. Some of them were among my favorite ice cream flavors of all-time. Some I had no idea had been discontinued!     For each flavor, we\\u2019ll give the official Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor description, followed by the silly and fun epitaph on the headstone in the graveyard.    Oatmeal Cookie Chunk (2004-2012)    Sweet cream cinnamon ice cream with oatmeal cookies & fudge chunks    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"683\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/oatmeal-cookie-chunk.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"oatmeal cookie chunk\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19950\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/oatmeal-cookie-chunk.jpg 500w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/oatmeal-cookie-chunk-329x450.jpg 329w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/oatmeal-cookie-chunk-439x600.jpg 439w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\\\" />                                                                    Let\\u2019s start off with a bang, with my favorite ice cream flavor of all-time. That\\u2019s right, Oatmeal Cookie Chunk is the greatest ice cream flavor in the history of humankind! According to my taste buds, at least.    What made it so great? Start with a sweet cream cinnamon ice cream. That base is packed with flavor and unspeakably delicious. Then add in chocolate chunks and huge swaths of oatmeal cookie dough, and you have a flawless combination.    Backstory: My entire life, I used to wonder why cookie dough ice cream was just boring vanilla ice cream with tiny little unsatisfying balls of cookie dough tossed in. Why, I wondered, couldn\\u2019t they swirl in huge swaths of the cookie dough? Why couldn\\u2019t half the container be cookie dough swirls?    And then I discovered Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Oatmeal Cookie Chunk, and its robust cookie dough swaths. And my life was changed. Suddenly, anything was possible in the world of ice cream!    This was one of the longest-lasting flavors in the graveyard, remaining in stores for 8 years before it was discontinued.                                                                     The only reason I\\u2019m not depressed about its absence is that B&J now has a similar flavor, Oat of This Swirled, which features oatmeal cookie dough swirled into a brown sugar ice cream. It\\u2019s similar enough to give me that oatmeal cookie fix I need.    KaBerry KaBoom (2001)    Strawberry & blueberry ice creams with fudge-covered cracklin\\u2019 candy & a blueberry swirl    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"793\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kaberry-kaboom.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"kaberry kaboom flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19951\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kaberry-kaboom.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kaberry-kaboom-312x450.jpg 312w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kaberry-kaboom-416x600.jpg 416w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Yikes. It\\u2019s not hard to see why this one failed! Cracklin\\u2019 candies in ice cream? I could see that maybe working if done correctly. But covering the candy in chocolate is definitely not the way to do it. Imagine Nerds or Skittles covered in chocolate. Nobody wants that!    Also, strawberry and blueberry together is just way too sweet. I never got to try this flavor, but I can totally get why it didn\\u2019t survive even one full year.    Schweddy Balls (2011)    Vanilla ice cream with a hint of rum, loaded with fudge-covered rum & malt balls    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/schweddy-balls-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"schweddy balls ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19953\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/schweddy-balls-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/schweddy-balls-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/schweddy-balls-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Only Ben and Jerry are crazy enough to conceive an ice cream flavor around a Saturday Night Live sketch from a decade earlier.     That would be the famous 1998 sketch featuring Alec Baldwin as Pete Schweddy, a baker whose \\u201cSchweddy balls\\u201d were a favorite holiday dessert.    Schweddy Balls was a limited edition holiday batch for 2011, so it was never expected to live forever. Rum balls in a vanilla ice cream doesn\\u2019t sound like a combination that could last for years anyway. It was just a novelty flavor.    You can see that someone left roses at this headstone. That\\u2019s just silly enough to be funny.    Dave Matthews Band\\u2019s Magic Brownies (2007-2011)    Black raspberry ice cream swirled with sweet cream ice cream & fudgy brownies    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dave-matthews-band-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"dave matthews band ben &amp; jerrys ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19955\\\" style=\\\"width:550px;height:800px\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dave-matthews-band-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dave-matthews-band-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dave-matthews-band-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    The Dave Matthews Band was one of the biggest bands in the world in the early 2000s, and they shared a similar worldview with Ben & Jerry\\u2019s. Hence, a collab was born.    Magic Brownies was actually the second Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor in honor of DMB. I distinctly remember the first, called One Sweet Whirled (after the DMB tune \\u201cOne Sweet World\\u201d). That flavor arrived in 2002 and featured caramel and coffee ice creams with marshmallow swirls and coffee-flavored chocolate chips.     As a huge DMB fan, I was compelled to buy One Sweet Whirled, even though I don\\u2019t like coffee. It was decent, but only lasted until 2004.                                                                     Three years later, B&J decided to try another DMB flavor, this time with a raspberry kick. I don\\u2019t love raspberry in ice cream, so I never got around to trying the Magic Brownies.     Fresh Georgia Peach (1986-1991)    Vanilla ice cream with fresh Georgia peaches    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-graveyard-peach.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben jerrys graveyard peach\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19957\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-graveyard-peach.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-graveyard-peach-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerrys-graveyard-peach-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Here\\u2019s one of the oldest flavors in the graveyard. Georgia peach was created in 1986, and it was very simple. Just vanilla ice cream with peaches. That was enough to last for five years.    I absolutely love peach ice cream, and would\\u2019ve been all over this flavor if I\\u2019d had the chance, but it was before my ice cream-buying time. B&J later created a Willie Nelson Peach Cobbler flavor that added shortbread into the mix.    What a Cluster (aka Clusterfluff) (2011-2014)    Peanut butter ice cream with caramel cluster pieces, marshmallow swirls & peanut buttery swirls    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clusterfluff-ben-jerrys.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"clusterfluff ben jerrys\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19958\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clusterfluff-ben-jerrys.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clusterfluff-ben-jerrys-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clusterfluff-ben-jerrys-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Here\\u2019s the other flavor in the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavor graveyard that I miss dearly. What a Cluster is another of my all-time fave ice cream flavors.     It\\u2019s basically peanut butter and marshmallow, which is an incredible combination, with the added sweetness and crunchy texture of caramel clusters. It was modeled after fluffernutter. I was so bummed when this flavor went away!    Interesting fact \\u2013 this one was originally called Clusterfluff. That was a fun and slightly edgy play on words. And then shortly after, with no announcement or explanation, they changed it to the much more boring What a Cluster. Did Ben & Jerry\\u2019s succumb to consumer complaints about the name? Who knows, but that name change always bothered me.    Peanuts! Popcorn! (2000)    Caramel ice cream with white fudge-covered caramel popcorn, toffee-covered peanuts & a caramel swirl    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanuts-popcorn-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"peanuts popcorn ben and jerrys\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19959\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanuts-popcorn-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanuts-popcorn-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanuts-popcorn-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Popcorn in ice cream? Gotta give kudos to Ben and Jerry for trying new things. But it didn\\u2019t quite work.     I have to say, the idea of peanuts and popcorn in ice cream doesn\\u2019t sound that appetizing initially. But when you read further, and realize that the popcorn was actually caramel popcorn, and that it was covered in white chocolate, and the peanuts were covered in toffee\\u2026 that actually sounds tasty!    Evidently, customers didn\\u2019t think so, as it disappeared in 2000, the same year it hit the market.

Plain old neapolitan isn\\u2019t really going to excite the typical B&J buyer. The company understood that and changed the neapolitan formula.    Instead of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry, Neapolitan Dynamite offered a pairing of Cherry Garcia and Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice creams instead. I never tried this one, but enough fans of the movie bought it that it hung around for four years.

I love pear and never understood why there isn\\u2019t pear cobbler, pear-flavored soda, pear ice cream, pear yogurt, and all the rest.    Imagine my surprise upon learning that Ben & Jerry\\u2019s once produced a pear ice cream! But it was here for such a short time, I blinked and missed it.    Reading the description, though, I\\u2019m not sure how good it would\\u2019ve been. Ben & Jerry have this unfortunate compulsion to add chocolate to flavors that don\\u2019t need it (like Oatmeal Cookie Chunk.) And here we see that their pear ice cream actually had a fudge swirl. WTF, B & J?    I think the way to make a pear flavor work would\\u2019ve been to keep the mix-ins to a minimum. A few shaved almonds are fine, and maybe some cinnamon or brown sugar to punch it up a little. That\\u2019s all you need.     Holy Cannoli (1997-1998)    Creamy Ricotta and pistachio ice cream with chocolate-covered cannolis and roasted pistachio    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/holy-cannoli-flavor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"holy cannoli flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19964\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/holy-cannoli-flavor.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/holy-cannoli-flavor-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/holy-cannoli-flavor-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    I wonder if the reason Holy Cannoli never took off is that many people don\\u2019t know what cannolis are. It\\u2019s not a common dessert in most parts of the country.     The cannoli is a delicious Italian pastry stuffed with a creamy filling. I actually just had my first cannoli recently at Mike\\u2019s Pastry in the Cambridge neighborhood of Boston.     I\\u2019d totally buy Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Holy Cannoli if it came out today, but I never tried it back in the day.                                                                    The epitaph speculates that perhaps people were turned off by the pistachios, but I\\u2019m not so sure about that. Ben & Jerry\\u2019s has a Pistachio flavor that is still going strong.     I think that cannolis were just too unfamiliar, or the idea of Ricotta cheese in an ice cream didn\\u2019t sound appetizing enough.

But a glimpse at the ingredient list shows that there\\u2019s no actual cake in there \\u2013 just ice cream made to taste like cake batter. There aren\\u2019t even any rainbow sprinkles \\u2013 just a swirl of chocolate frosting.    The company did later make an actual \\u201cBirthday Cake\\u201d flavor that was more in tune with the kind of cake ice creams people are craving these days.

A traditional Boston Cream Pie is delicious, and this one captured its essence successfully, with the fudge and the pasty cream swirl.     Sad to see this one go, but at least it had a respectable six-year run!    UPDATE: Last year, Ben & Jerry\\u2019s released Bossin\\u2019 Cream Pie, an updated version of this flavor. It\\u2019s basically the same, except the layer of chocolate and chips are right on the top, rather than swirled in. I tried it and sadly didn\\u2019t love it, because the chocolate is hard and crunchy, rather than smooth and soft, as it is on the actual pie itself.

In the meantime, let\\u2019s mourn the loss of Wild Maine Blueberry ice cream. This was a rare Ben & Jerry\\u2019s offering that featured a fruit puree as part of the blend. We haven\\u2019t really seen other purees since then, so evidently customers made their voices heard that it wasn\\u2019t a winning formula.     Peanut Butter Me Up (2002-2003)    A peanut butter caramel core surrounded by peanut butter & chocolate ice creams with fudge chips                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanut-butter-me-up-ben-jerry.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"peanut butter me up ben jerry\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19968\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanut-butter-me-up-ben-jerry.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanut-butter-me-up-ben-jerry-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/peanut-butter-me-up-ben-jerry-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />    A peanut butter flavor that didn\\u2019t sell? How is that possible?! It sounds especially delicious \\u2013 peanut butter and chocolate ice creams with a peanut butter caramel core.                                                                    Maybe back in 2002, Ben & Jerry\\u2019s hadn\\u2019t yet mastered the \\u201ccore\\u201d ice cream techniques. These days, they have lots of flavors with a core filling, but they didn\\u2019t have many two decades ago. In fact, this was one of the first three \\u201ccore\\u201d ice creams the company created, which all debuted in 2002. Perhaps consumers weren\\u2019t yet ready for that type of dairy innovation.     Or maybe the caramel part was a turnoff. Caramel really doesn\\u2019t belong here. Ben and Jerry should hire someone to edit their flavor combinations before they hit the market!    Chocolate Comfort (1999)    Chocolate truffle ice low fat ice cream swirled with white chocolate low fat ice cream    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chocolate-comfort.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"chocolate comfort\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19969\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chocolate-comfort.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chocolate-comfort-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/chocolate-comfort-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    You have to really screw something up to create a chocolate-flavored ice cream that people don\\u2019t like. So how did Ben & Jerry do it?    Well, the main crime was attempting a low-fat ice cream. If you\\u2019ve ever checked the label on a pint of Ben & Jerry\\u2019s you know that it\\u2019s absolutely loaded with calories and fat. We just accept that as the tradeoff for all that flavor.    This was an attempt to find out if there was a market for a lower-fat flavor, and apparently there was not. But I also think that making it a \\u201cchocolate truffle\\u201d flavor was a bad idea. I know truffles are all the rage, but a lot of us just don\\u2019t like truffle flavor and would never buy a flavor like this.

I\\u2019ve never seen such a flavor anywhere. Perhaps there\\u2019s a reason for that. If B&J couldn\\u2019t make it work, maybe no one can.    Who is Miz Jelena, by the way? I have no idea. I found a company called \\u201cMiz Jelena\\u2019s Homemade Southern Cookin'\\u201d that incorporated in 1992, the same year this ice cream hit the market, so perhaps there was a connection. Maybe Ben & Jerry had plans to create a whole line of southern-themed Miz Jelena ice creams if this one worked out. Alas, it did not.

The name is so off-putting. I cringe every time I read it.    Still, if the ice cream had featured lots of delicious mix-ins, I would\\u2019ve overlooked the name and given it a try. But it was literally just vanilla ice cream with nuts, fudge, and caramel. It\\u2019s hard to imagine a less inventive combination.    Pina Colada (2013)    Coconut ice cream with pineapple chunks                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pina-colada-ben-jerry.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"pina colada - ben &amp; jerry's graveyard\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19975\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pina-colada-ben-jerry.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pina-colada-ben-jerry-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/pina-colada-ben-jerry-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />    Pineapple chunks mixed into coconut ice cream? Sign me up! Pina Colada ice cream was absolutely delicious. I wish this flavor had become a staple of the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s product line, but they chose to make it a Limited Batch, available only during summer 2013.                                                                    Interesting fact: I loved this ice cream during its brief run. When it went off the market, I was forced to look around to find other brands that had similar flavors. I finally located Haagen Dazs\\u2019 Pineapple Coconut, which has remained one of my favorites for the past several years.     So Ben & Jerry inadvertently created more business for their rival, by getting me addicted to a flavor and then immediately pulling it off the market. That\\u2019s probably not what they had in mind!    P.S. Pineapple lovers may want to check out my article about visiting the Dole Plantation in Hawaii.

They\\u2019re similar to Moon Pies, the beloved product of Chattanooga, Tennessee. But Whoopie Pies tend to be softer and feature chocolate, while Moon Pies can have various flavors.    Ben and Jerry chose to give their Whoopie Pie ice cream a clever name that recalls the Newlywed Game. And they opted to feature a chocolate ice cream base with marshmallow and devil\\u2019s food cookies swirled in. That sounds tasty! Every ice cream I\\u2019ve ever tried that features marshmallow has been delicious. I wish I\\u2019d gotten a chance to try this one.

Vermonty Python (2006-2008)    Coffee liqueur ice cream with a chocolate cookie crumb swirl and fudge cows    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vermonty-python-flavor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"vermonty python ice cream flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19983\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vermonty-python-flavor.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vermonty-python-flavor-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vermonty-python-flavor-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Ooh, Vermonty Python (named, of course, for the iconic British comedy troupe Monty Python) sounds like it would have been a really good ice cream. I\\u2019ve come around over the years to enjoying coffee-flavored ice cream.    This one takes the coffee and adds in chocolate cookie crumbs. More ice creams should feature cookie crumbs! That\\u2019s another winning ingredient. As for the \\u201cfudge cows,\\u201d well, those are just weird. They were evidently little pieces of fudge shaped like cows. I guess they capture the bizarre vibe of Monty Python, so it all makes sense.    Mission to Marzipan (2009-2010)    Sweet cream ice cream with almond cookies & a marzipan swirl    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mission-to-marzipan.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"mission to marzipan ben &amp; jerry's flavor graveyard\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19984\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mission-to-marzipan.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mission-to-marzipan-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mission-to-marzipan-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Mission to Marzipan is a cool-sounding name. But understanding this flavor requires actually knowing what marzipan is. I didn\\u2019t know marzipan was actually a real thing. I assumed it was a silly word made up by Ben and Jerry.    Turns out that marzipan is a confection made from sugar, honey, and ground almonds. And this pint mixes a marzipan swirl into a sweet cream ice cream. Sweet cream is eternally one of the best ice cream flavors. This combination was great!    Sugar Plum (1989-1990)    Plum ice cream with a caramel swirl                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sugar-plum-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"sugar plum ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19982\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sugar-plum-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sugar-plum-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sugar-plum-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />    There was a plum ice cream? Seriously? There was a plum ice cream? I love strange flavors, and this one has to be one of the strangest. You never see plum-flavored anything.     Sugar Plum ice cream hit stores in 1989, way before I was buying ice cream. I was a kid and my family was buying gallon containers of generic vanilla back then, so I sadly had no opportunity to give the plum variety a shot. If you ever tried Sugar Plum, please leave a comment letting us know how it was!                                                                    Chocolate Almond Fudge Chip (1993-1996, 1998-1999, 2001-2006)    Coconut ice cream with fudge chips & roasted almonds    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/coconut-almond-fudge-chip.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"coconut almond fudge chip\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19986\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/coconut-almond-fudge-chip.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/coconut-almond-fudge-chip-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/coconut-almond-fudge-chip-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Chocolate Almond Fudge Chip is the flavor that seemingly never dies. It was sent to the graveyard in 1996, brought back two years later, re-graveyarded in 1999, brought back once more two years later, and finally sent back to the graveyard in 2006.    It\\u2019s easy to see why this flavor keeps returning. We all know that coconut and chocolate are a proven combo. I appreciate that B&J used a coconut ice cream base with chocolate mixed in, as opposed to a chocolate base with coconut mixed in. Going all-in on coconut is never a bad idea!    Tennessee Mud (1988-1989)    Coffee ice cream with Amaretto, Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey, and roasted slivered almonds    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tennessee-mud-flavor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"tennessee mud flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19987\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tennessee-mud-flavor.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tennessee-mud-flavor-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tennessee-mud-flavor-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Booze! Not many Ben & Jerry\\u2019s ice creams contain liquor, but Tennessee Mud sure did. It mixed Jack Daniels and Amaretto into a coffee-flavored ice cream base.    I personally don\\u2019t love boozy ice creams, and I guess the public didn\\u2019t go for it, either. You also have to figure that adding Jack Daniels into the mix was cost-prohibitive. They probably weren\\u2019t making as much profit from each pint of Tennessee Mud as they were from other flavors, because that whiskey ain\\u2019t cheap.

The description won me over though. A sweet custard ice cream (that\\u2019s different!) with a caramelized sugar swirl? It sounded fantastic. And it was.    I don\\u2019t know how you go about adding caramelized sugar into an ice cream, but I sure hope Ben and Jerry try it again sometime. This flavor lasted five years, which was a nice run.    Fossil Fuel (2005-2010)    Sweet cream ice cream with chocolate cookie pieces, fudge dinosaurs, and a fudge swirl    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fossil-fuel-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"fossil fuel ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19991\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fossil-fuel-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fossil-fuel-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fossil-fuel-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Fossil Fuel was a fairly simple combination \\u2013 sweet cream ice cream with chocolate and fudge. But that\\u2019s a really appealing pairing. That explains why the flavor survived for five years.    This flavor allowed the company to highlight the important issue of renewable energy. When they retired Fossil Fuel, Ben and Jerry said, \\u201cWe made the decision to lay it to rest in the Flavor Graveyard, because we believe that fossil fuels, whether ice cream or the real thing, belong in the ground!\\u201d    The Wich (2004-2006)    Chewy chocolate chunk cookies with vanilla & chocolately chip ice cream                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-wich-flavor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"the wich flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19993\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-wich-flavor.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-wich-flavor-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-wich-flavor-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />    The Wich was the B&J attempt to recreate the magic of an ice cream sandwich. Chewy cookies mixed into an ice cream is a great idea, but the flavor was still too basic to last.                                                                    Once the company started selling proper ice cream sandwiches, that kinda rendered The Wich unnecessary.    Dastardly Mash (1979-1991)    Chocolate ice cream with pecans, almonds, raisins & chocolate chips    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dastardly-mash.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"dastardly mash ben jerry\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19994\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dastardly-mash.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dastardly-mash-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dastardly-mash-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Here\\u2019s another really old one. Dastardly Mash was created in 1979 and lasted more than a decade. The epitaph poem on its headstone speculates that the raisins may have caused its demise.     That sounds about right! Raisins in ice cream are rare. Their sweet and chewy texture conflicts with the creamy goodness of the ice cream. It would be like putting Skittles or jelly beans in ice cream.    Interestingly, though, I always wondered why my beloved Oatmeal Cookie Chunk didn\\u2019t have raisins. If you\\u2019re going to have raisins in any ice cream, oatmeal cookie is the place for it! It always struck me as odd that the oatmeal ice cream had chocolate chips instead.    Cool Britannia (1989-1990)    Vanilla ice cream with strawberries and fudge-covered shortbread    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cool-britannia-ben-jerry.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"cool britannia ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19995\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cool-britannia-ben-jerry.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cool-britannia-ben-jerry-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cool-britannia-ben-jerry-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Cool Britannia wasn\\u2019t quite cool enough, as it only lasted two years. Strawberries and shortbread do indeed sound like a good pairing.     But again, why add fudge to the mix? This was another flavor where B&J added chocolate unnecessarily, resulting in an inferior flavor.    Economic Crunch (1987)    Vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered almonds, pecans and walnuts    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/economic-crunch-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"economic crunch ben &amp; jerrys flavor graveyard\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19996\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/economic-crunch-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/economic-crunch-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/economic-crunch-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Economic Crunch has to be one of the weirdest ideas Ben & Jerry ever had. After the October 1987 stock market crash, they whipped up this vanilla + nuts concoction and personally delivered it to stock brokers on Wall Street in New York City to cheer them up.    But a stock market crash is such a bizarre thing to commemorate with an ice cream. By that logic, why not create a Pearl Harbor flavor?     Wavy Gravy (1992-2001)    Caramel and cashew Brazil nut ice cream with a chocolate hazelnut fudge swirl & roasted almonds    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wavy-gravy-ice-cream.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"wavy gravy ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-19997\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wavy-gravy-ice-cream.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wavy-gravy-ice-cream-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/wavy-gravy-ice-cream-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Wavy Gravy is a famous hippie best-known for his appearance at Woodstock. Ben approached him in San Francisco in 1991 with the idea of naming an ice cream after him.    After some trial and error, they settled on a caramel and cashew Brazil nut ice cream with almonds and hazelnut. That\\u2019s a really complex recipe. Perhaps there was too much going on for just one pint. But the flavor lasted for 8 years.    Wavy Gravy ice cream was briefly resurrected in 2005 as the winner of a fan vote, and was again available at scoop shops across the country for a short time.

I\\u2019ve always loved white chocolate, but its flavor can be a bit too sweet when it\\u2019s mixed into an ice cream. I wonder if that\\u2019s what happened with Bovinity Divinity.     This one mixed white and milk chocolate ice creams and cows. Ultimately, it\\u2019s just different types of chocolate, so I\\u2019m guessing it might not have been creative enough to satisfy the public.

This one was modeled after the White Russian and features Kahlua coffee liqueur with coffee ice cream.    Is that too much coffee? Perhaps. The flavor survived for a full decade though, so lots of people enjoyed it. Hmm\\u2026 now I\\u2019m in the mood to order a White Russian at the bar!

The flavor was a little too simple for my taste \\u2013 just vanilla ice cream with crunchy nuts. But at least it was for a good cause.    This is Nuts (2001-2002)    A nutty mix of chocolate & pistachio ice creams with fudge-covered almonds & lightly-roasted pistachios    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-this-is-nuts.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben jerry this is nuts\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20016\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-this-is-nuts.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-this-is-nuts-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-this-is-nuts-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    The name This is Nuts makes it sound as though this flavor has several different types of nuts mixed in. But it\\u2019s actually just pistachios and almonds, with fudge and chocolate ice cream.    I personally love pistachios and would\\u2019ve enjoyed this flavor. But I can see why the general public wouldn\\u2019t have been blown away. Hey, at least Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Pistachio flavor is still on the market!

In this case, Coconut Almond Fudge Chip was paired with New York Super Fudge Chunk.    Both flavors are good on their own. But I\\u2019ve never been a fan of these pairings. I\\u2019d rather have a full pint of the flavors I like instead of splitting a pint between two flavors.    Ethan Almond (1988)    Vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered almonds                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ethan-almond-flavor.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ethan almond flavor\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20018\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ethan-almond-flavor.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ethan-almond-flavor-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ethan-almond-flavor-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />    Ethan Almond has to get the prize for simplest flavor in the history of Ben & Jerry\\u2019s. Just vanilla with almonds covered in chocolate.     If you\\u2019re wondering about the strange name, Ethan Almond was a tribute to Ethan Allen, a Revolutionary War patriot and early leader of Vermont. Most people have never heard of him, so this flavor may have been doomed from the start.

This one included cookie dough and was moderately successful, lasting for 7 years.

This was at least a creative flavor design, mixing raspberry, blackberry, and passion fruit.      Devil\\u2019s Food Chocolate Sorbet (1996-2001)    Swirls of light chocolate & dark chocolate sorbet    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/devils-food-chocolate.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"devil's food chocolate sorbet\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20021\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/devils-food-chocolate.jpg 550w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/devils-food-chocolate-309x450.jpg 309w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/devils-food-chocolate-413x600.jpg 413w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\\\" />                                                                    Devil\\u2019s food is one of the richest flavors around, but how would it taste in sorbet form? I never got to find out. Devil\\u2019s Food Chocolate Sorbet stuck around for five years before leaving us in 2001, the same year many other flavors joined the graveyard.    Discontinued Ben & Jerry\\u2019s Flavors That Aren\\u2019t in the Graveyard    Ben & Jerry\\u2019s makes it seem as though all of the abandoned flavors are here in the graveyard. But I was surprised to learn there are dozens of discontinued flavors which don\\u2019t have headstones like the others.     Here\\u2019s a selection of some of the discontinued Ben & Jerry\\u2019s flavors you won\\u2019t see in the flavor graveyard:    Brownie Batter. (Brownie batter ice cream with a rich brownie batter swirl) Ahhh, this brings back memories. Brownie Batter ice cream was so delicious! Why\\u2019d they have to stop production? It lasted from 2003 to 2011. I\\u2019m still upset that Ben and Jerry gave up on this one. But at least there\\u2019s a Brownie Batter Core ice cream still on the market.    Festivus. (Brown sugar cinnamon ice cream with gingerbread cookies & a ginger-caramel swirl) This Seinfeld-themed flavor \\u2013 tagline \\u201cThe flavor for the rest of us\\u201d \\u2013 was a Limited Edition batch during the holiday seasons of 2000 and 2001. It later reappeared under two different names: Gingerbread Cookie (2004) and Gingersnap (2009.)    Fred & Ginger. (Ginger ice cream with chocolate bowties) This flavor was created in honor of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, legendary dance and film partners. Unfortunately, it was massively unpopular, and 45 of the 47 scoop shops that carried it did not reorder. Ginger is just a weird flavor for an ice cream, so it was a clever concept, but a bad ice cream. It was here and gone in 1988.                                                                    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"597\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-factory-tour-vermont.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben and jerrys factory tour vermont\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20003\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-factory-tour-vermont.jpg 800w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-factory-tour-vermont-450x336.jpg 450w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-factory-tour-vermont-768x573.jpg 768w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\" />    Peanut Butter & Jelly. (Peanut butter ice cream with peanut butter bits and strawberry jelly swirl) PB&J is such an interesting idea for an ice cream flavor. But there\\u2019s a reason why you never see jelly in ice creams from any brand. This was lasted from 1989 to 1990. This flavor used to have a headstone in the graveyard, but for some reason it was removed.    Mocha Walnut. (Mocha ice cream with walnuts) Available only during 1981, this was Ben & Jerry\\u2019s worst-selling flavor of all-time. That especially disappointed Ben, who called it his personal favorite flavor. Perhaps the American public just wasn\\u2019t ready for a coffee-flavored ice cream in the early \\u201980s.                                                                    Coconutterly Fair. (Chocolate ice cream with coconut caramel swirls & a chocolately-covered coconut caramel crunch) Coconutterly Fair, served up from 2011 to 2012, had a name that didn\\u2019t make much sense, and a flavor profile that wasn\\u2019t different enough from some other coconut ice creams Ben and Jerry already had.    Goodbye Yellow Brickle Road. (Chocolate ice cream, peanut butter cookie dough, brickle candy pieces, and white chocolately chunks) In 2008, the company created an Elton John-themed flavor in honor of Sir Elton\\u2019s first-ever concert in Vermont. This Limited Batch was off store shelves by 2009, but it was good while it lasted.     Willie Nelson\\u2019s Country Peach Cobbler. (Peach ice cream with cinnamon-sugar shortbread pieces and a peach swirl) Ooh, I love me some cobbler! This Willie Nelson-inspired flavor sounds positively delightful.     Run Burgundy\\u2019s Scotchy Scotch Scotch. (Butterscotch ice cream with butterscotch swirls) A Ron Burgundy-themed ice cream! This heavy butterscotch flavor honored the famous Will Ferrell newscaster character. That\\u2019s a lot of butterscotch, though.    Tuskegee Chunk. (Peanut butter ice cream with chocolate chunks) It\\u2019s just peanut butter and chocolate! Like a Reese\\u2019s cup! How could Tuskegee Chunk have failed? This one remains a mystery. It was featured from 1989 to 1990.    Cow Power. (Sweet cream ice cream with chocolate cookie pieces, dark chocolatey cows & a chocolate fudge swirl) Cow Power had a lot of cream and a lot of chocolate, but it was pretty basic. This was a limited batch created only for 2012.    Fudge Central. (A soft fudge truffle core surrounded by chocolate & vanilla ice creams with white and dark fudge chips) Fudge Central was one of the three initial \\u201ccore\\u201d ice creams Ben & Jerry created in 2002, along with Peanut Butter Me Up (which appears in the graveyard) and Karamel Sutra (which is still sold today.) Fudge Central had a unique fudge truffle core, but only lasted until 2005.                                                                    Black & Tan. (Cream stout ice cream swirled with chocolate ice cream) Created in 2006, this flavor was designed to capture the essence of the UK beverage Black & Tan, which blends a pale ale and a dark beer. But some Irish consumers reminded Ben and Jerry that Black & Tan was also the name of the notoriously aggressive police force recruited during the Irish War of Independence. B&J apologized and quickly did away with the flavor.    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"700\\\" height=\\\"560\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/discontinued-flavors.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"discontinued flavors\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20009\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/discontinued-flavors.jpg 700w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/discontinued-flavors-450x360.jpg 450w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\" />    Hazed & Confused Core. (Chocolate & hazelnut ice creams with fudge chips and a hazelnut fudge core) The Hazed & Confused Core flavor lasted only from 2014 to 2015. It was the third failed Ben & Jerry\\u2019s hazelnut flavor, following Chocolate Hazelnut Swirl (1988-1991) and Coffee Hazelnut Swirl (2000.)                                                                    Orange & Cream. (Sweet Orange ice cream with swirls of vanilla ice cream) Take an orange creamsicle, remove the stick, and pack it in a pint, and you have Orange & Cream. I would love this flavor, so I\\u2019m not sure why it didn\\u2019t succeed!    Chocolate Orange Fudge. (Chocolate fudge ice cream infused with orange liqueur) I don\\u2019t know about the combination of chocolate and orange. It doesn\\u2019t sound very appealing. Apparently I\\u2019m in the majority with this opinion.    Most of the 2Twisted flavors. In the early 2000s, Ben and Jerry decided to create a series of 2Twisted ice creams, which were basically two different flavors packed together in the same pint.     While two of these offerings remain on the market (Half Baked and Everything But the\\u2026), most of them are long gone. That includes Monkey Wrench (Chunky Monkey + Peanut Butter Cup), Entangled Mints (Mint Chocolate Cookie + Marble Mint Chunk), and Pulp Addiction (Chocolate Orange Fudge + Orange & Cream.)    There are many more abandoned flavors. In addition to all the flavors listed above, the official Ben & Jerry\\u2019s site lists the following flavors as discontinued: Apricot, Banana Walnut, Blond Brownie Sundae, Cantaloupe, Cold Brew Caramel Latte Ice Cream, Egg Nog, Grapefruit Ice, Heath Bar Crunch, Ice Tea Ginseng, Lemon Meringue, Malted Milk Ball, Mango, Maple Grape Nut, Pecan Sticky Buns, Pink Lemonade, Rootbeer Float My Boat, Smores, and Snickerdoodle Cookie.    That\\u2019s quite a list!

The tour takes visitors through a viewing window above the manufacturing room. You can see the flavors being produced and mixed in large tanks. The windows are small, and the time is brief, so don\\u2019t expect to see too much.    There\\u2019s also a video presentation describing the history of the company, and a gift shop with all sorts of goodies, including souvenirs and pints of various flavors.    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"740\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-gift-shop-740x600.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ben jerry gift shop\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20000\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-gift-shop-740x600.jpg 740w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-gift-shop-450x365.jpg 450w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ben-jerry-gift-shop.jpg 750w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\\\" />                                                                    I felt the tour was worth the $6, even if it was somewhat short. The tour ends with a free sample of a flavor of the day. They tried to fool people with this fake sign stating that today\\u2019s flavor was \\u201cBroccoli Cheddar Chunk.\\u201d    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"437\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/broccoli-cheddar-chunk-437x600.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"broccoli cheddar ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20002\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/broccoli-cheddar-chunk-437x600.jpg 437w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/broccoli-cheddar-chunk-328x450.jpg 328w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/broccoli-cheddar-chunk.jpg 550w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px\\\" />                                                                    Then the tour guide flipped over the sign to reveal the actual flavor of the day, Strawberry Cheesecake. But many of us were bummed that there wasn\\u2019t really a Broccoli Cheddar flavor we could try. Hearing Strawberry Cheesecake after that was honestly a letdown.     There\\u2019s also a scoop shop on the premises. I got a cup of Marshmallow Sky, because I\\u2019d never heard of that flavor before.     It\\u2019s marshmallow ice cream with marshmallow swirl and cookie dough chunks. Plus it has an eye-catching sky blue color. So delicious!    <img decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"435\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" src=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/marshmallow-sky-ice-cream-435x600.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"marshmallow sky ice cream\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-20005\\\" srcset=\\\"https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/marshmallow-sky-ice-cream-435x600.jpg 435w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/marshmallow-sky-ice-cream-327x450.jpg 327w, https://quirkytravelguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/marshmallow-sky-ice-cream.jpg 550w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\\\" />                                                                    And that\\u2019s it for my visit to the Ben & Jerry\\u2019s graveyard in Vermont! It\\u2019s a must-visit on any New England road trip through Vermont and New Hampshire.    In slightly-related news I\\u2019ve blogged about a surprising number of real graveyards, including Andy Warhol\\u2019s grave in Pittsburgh, Marilyn Monroe\\u2019s grave in Los Angeles, and the Granary Cemetery in Boston.
