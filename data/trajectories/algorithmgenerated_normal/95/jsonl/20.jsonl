Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify the authors of the paper \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\" published in 2015, determine which of these authors had authored papers prior to 2015, and find the title of the first paper authored by the identified author.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Search for the paper \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\" published in 2015 to identify its authors.\n2. Check the publication history of each author to identify who had authored papers prior to 2015.\n3. Find the title of the first paper authored by the identified author.\n\n## Output format\n- The title of the first paper authored by the author who had authored prior papers.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure the correct identification of the authors of the paper.\n- Verify the publication history accurately to determine the first authored paper.\n- Provide the title of the first authored paper in a clear and concise manner.\n\n## Results (including code blocks) and reason from last response\nThe identified authors of the paper \"Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?\" published in 2015 are Pietro Murano and Iram N. The search for Pietro Murano's publication history on arXiv did not return useful results, as the papers found were authored by different individuals. Thus, additional searches on other databases or alternative methods are needed to accurately find Pietro Murano's first authored paper prior to 2015.\n\n### Errors or issues in the conversation\n1. **Search on ArXiv Unrelated Results Issue**: The results returned during the search for Pietro Murano's publication history on arXiv yielded papers with various unrelated authors and topics, indicating that the search query may be too broad or not targeted appropriately.\n2. **Database Limitation**: Depending solely on arXiv for publication history may not be comprehensive. Alternative databases such as Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or institutional repositories should be considered.\n\n### Need to double-check?\nYes "}
