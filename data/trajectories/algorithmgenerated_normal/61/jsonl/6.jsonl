Run the Python code against an array of strings, listed below. The output of the Python script will be a URL containing C++ source code. Compile and run this C++ code against the array [35, 12, 8, 99, 21, 5] and return the sum of the third and fifth integers in the sorted list.\n\narr = ['_alg', 'ghi', 'C++', 'jkl', 'tps', '/Q', 'pqr', 'stu', ':', '//', 'rose', 'vwx', 'yz1', '234', 'tta', '567', '890', 'cod', 'e.', 'or', 'g/', 'wiki', '/', 'ing', 'sort', 'abc' , 'or', 'it', 'hms', 'mno' , 'uic', 'ksort', '#', 'ht' ] Please solve the problem carefully.The attached file path is: ../2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nExecute the provided Python script against the given array of strings and extract the URL containing C++ source code.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Execute the provided Python script with the given array of strings.\n2. Extract the URL from the script's output.\n\n## Output format\nThe extracted URL containing C++ source code.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure the Python script is executed correctly and the URL is accurately extracted."}

However, since I cannot directly see or access external images, could you please provide the contents of the Python script? Once I have that, I can execute it against the given array of strings and extract the URL containing the C++ source code. \n\nOnce you share the script, we can move forward."}
