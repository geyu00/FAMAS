{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich bar is closest to Mummers Museum in Philadelphia and is wheel chair accessible?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is the Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n   - The request is for a bar that is closest to the Mummers Museum.\n   - The bar must be wheelchair accessible.\n   - The exact address of the Mummers Museum is 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of bars near the Mummers Museum.\n   - Information on which of these bars are wheelchair accessible.\n   - Specific distances from the Mummers Museum to nearby bars.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Google Maps, Yelp, the Mummers Museum website, and local accessibility guides or resources.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The closest bar to the Mummers Museum based on the distances obtained from the lookup.\n   - Confirmation of wheelchair accessibility for the closest bar.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Mummers Museum is located in an area of Philadelphia that has several bars, given the cultural and historical significance of the Mummers in the city.\n   - Some bars in Philadelphia are known to be wheelchair accessible, but this will need verification.\n   - Based on preliminary searches, the following bars are near the Mummers Museum:\n     - 12 Steps Down\n     - Dirty Franks\n     - McGillin's Olde Ale House\n     - Milkboy Coffee\n     - Bridget Foy's\n   - These bars are within walking distance of the Mummers Museum, but their exact distances and wheelchair accessibility need to be confirmed.\n\n**Reasoning for Educated Guesses:**\n- The area around the Mummers Museum is likely to have several establishments due to its location and the popularity of the Mummers parade.\n- Bars in urban areas like Philadelphia often have some level of accessibility, but specific details need to be verified through reliable sources such as their websites or Yelp pages.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Context Length Exceeded**: The error occurred because the model's maximum context length was exceeded. This indicates that the conversation history or the amount of data being processed was too large for the model to handle.\n- **Redundant Requests**: Repeatedly asking for the same information without reducing the context or breaking down the tasks led to the context length issue.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Break Down Tasks**: Divide the task into smaller, manageable steps to avoid exceeding the context length.\n- **Reduce Redundancy**: Ensure that each step builds on the previous one without repeating information unnecessarily.\n- **Use WebSurfer Efficiently**: Leverage WebSurfer to gather specific information directly from relevant sources.\n\n### Updated Plan\n1. **Verify the Address of the Mummers Museum**:\n   - Confirm the address: 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n\n2. **Find Nearby Bars**:\n   - Use Google Maps to find a list of bars near the Mummers Museum.\n   - Focus on the following bars: 12 Steps Down, Dirty Franks, McGillin's Olde Ale House, Milkboy Coffee, and Bridget Foy's.\n\n3. **Check Distances**:\n   - Use Google Maps to find the exact distances from the Mummers Museum to each of these bars.\n   - Record the distances.\n\n4. **Check Wheelchair Accessibility**:\n   - Use Yelp or the official websites of each bar to check for wheelchair accessibility.\n   - Record whether each bar is wheelchair accessible.\n\n5. **Derive the Closest Accessible Bar**:\n   - Compare the distances and accessibility information to determine the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1: Verify the Address**\n  - Assistant: Confirm the address of the Mummers Museum.\n  - WebSurfer: Search for \"Mummers Museum address\" and verify the address is 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n\n- **Step 2: Find Nearby Bars**\n  - WebSurfer: Search for \"bars near Mummers Museum 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147\" and list the following bars: 12 Steps Down, Dirty Franks, McGillin's Olde Ale House, Milkboy Coffee, and Bridget Foy's.\n\n- **Step 3: Check Distances**\n  - WebSurfer: Use Google Maps to find the exact distances from the Mummers Museum to each of the listed bars.\n  - Record the distances.\n\n- **Step 4: Check Wheelchair Accessibility**\n  - WebSurfer: For each bar, search for \"bar name wheelchair accessible\" on Yelp or the bar's official website.\n  - Record whether each bar is wheelchair accessible.\n\n- **Step 5: Derive the Closest Accessible Bar**\n  - Assistant: Compare the distances and accessibility information to determine the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n  - Provide the final answer.\n\n### Example Commands\n- **Step 1: Verify the Address**\n  - WebSurfer: Search for \"Mummers Museum address\" and confirm the address is 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n\n- **Step 2: Find Nearby Bars**\n  - WebSurfer: Search for \"bars near Mummers Museum 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147\" and list the following bars: 12 Steps Down, Dirty Franks, McGillin's Olde Ale House, Milkboy Coffee, and Bridget Foy's.\n\n- **Step 3: Check Distances**\n  - WebSurfer: Use Google Maps to find the exact distances from the Mummers Museum to each of the listed bars.\n  - Record the distances.\n\n- **Step 4: Check Wheelchair Accessibility**\n  - WebSurfer: For each bar, search for \"bar name wheelchair accessible\" on Yelp or the bar's official website.\n  - Record whether each bar is wheelchair accessible.\n\n- **Step 5: Derive the Closest Accessible Bar**\n  - Assistant: Compare the distances and accessibility information to determine the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n  - Provide the final answer.\n\nBy breaking down the tasks and ensuring each step is focused and efficient, we can avoid the context length issue and successfully complete the task."}
