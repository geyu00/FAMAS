{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Fund.\n   - The transaction fees for the fund are $0.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds available during the specified time period.\n   - The performance data (percentage increase) of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - The transaction fee information for each of these funds to confirm they have $0 transaction fees.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news sites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each relevant fund over the specified period.\n   - The identification of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Fidelity likely has multiple Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance of these funds can vary significantly, and economic conditions, market trends, and specific investment strategies will influence their performance.\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is possible that some funds may have experienced negative returns or very low positive returns.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify Relevant Fidelity Funds**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search Fidelity's official website for a list of International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees.\n  \n- **Collect Performance Data**\n  - Use WebSurfer to gather the performance data (percentage increase) for each identified fund from May 2019 to May 2024.\n  \n- **Derive Percentage Increase**\n  - Use Assistant to calculate the percentage increase for each fund over the specified period, if not directly provided.\n\n- **Determine the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase**\n  - Use Assistant to compare the percentage increases and identify the fund with the lowest value.\n\n- **Verify and Summarize**\n  - Use WebSurfer to verify the findings by cross-referencing with additional sources if necessary.\n  - Use Assistant to summarize the results and provide the final answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Fund.\n   - The transaction fees for the fund are $0.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n   - One identified fund is the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-ACC-USD (ISIN: LU0261950470), which has a 19.7% return over the 5-year period ending June 30, 2025.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds available during the specified time period.\n   - The performance data (percentage increase) of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - The transaction fee information for each of these funds to confirm they have $0 transaction fees.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news sites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n   - Additional funds to check include:\n     - Fidelity ® Emerging Markets Fund (Symbol: FEMKX)\n     - Fidelity Funds - Instl Emerging Markets Equity Fund I-ACC-USD\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each relevant fund over the specified period.\n   - The identification of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Fidelity likely has multiple Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance of these funds can vary significantly, and economic conditions, market trends, and specific investment strategies will influence their performance.\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is possible that some funds may have experienced negative returns or very low positive returns.\n   - Based on the performance data of the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-ACC-USD, it is reasonable to expect that other funds in this category may also have similar or varying performance metrics.\n   - The Fidelity ® Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) is a well-known fund and is likely to have comprehensive performance data available on Fidelity's official website or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The addition of the Fidelity ® Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) and the Fidelity Funds - Instl Emerging Markets Equity Fund I-ACC-USD is based on the search results and the likelihood that these are prominent funds in the category.\n- The performance data of the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-ACC-USD provides a benchmark for what to expect from other funds in the same category.\n- The assumption that Fidelity's official website and financial databases like Morningstar will have detailed performance data for these funds is based on the typical practices of financial institutions and the availability of such data for other mutual funds.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Repetitive Searches**: We repeatedly searched for the same information without refining the search queries or exploring different sources.\n2. **Incomplete Data Extraction**: We did not consistently extract and verify the performance data for multiple funds, focusing too narrowly on a single fund.\n3. **Technical Issues**: There were occasional technical issues with the web surfer, leading to incomplete or failed page loads.\n4. **Lack of Systematic Approach**: We did not have a systematic plan to ensure we covered all necessary steps and avoided redundant actions.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific search terms to find the required data.\n   - Example: \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024 site:fidelity.com\"\n\n2. **Systematic Data Collection**:\n   - Create a list of all relevant Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - For each fund, navigate to its performance page and extract the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n\n3. **Use Multiple Sources**:\n   - Cross-reference data from Fidelity's official website with financial databases like Morningstar.\n   - Use the WebSurfer to navigate and extract data from both sources.\n\n4. **Handle Technical Issues**:\n   - Ensure the WebSurfer waits for pages to fully load before extracting data.\n   - Retry failed searches or page loads to avoid missing important information.\n\n5. **Consolidate and Compare Data**:\n   - Compile the performance data for all identified funds.\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase over the specified period.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Search for Relevant Funds**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a search using the query \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024 site:fidelity.com\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of relevant funds from the search results.\n\n2. **Navigate to Each Fund's Performance Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each fund identified, navigate to its performance page on Fidelity's official website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the performance section and extract the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference with Morningstar**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a search using the query \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024 site:morningstar.com\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the performance data for the identified funds from Morningstar.\n\n4. **Handle Technical Issues**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the `sleep` function to wait for pages to fully load before extracting data.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Retry failed searches or page loads to ensure data completeness.\n\n5. **Compile and Compare Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the performance data for all identified funds.\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase over the specified period.\n\n6. **Summarize and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the final answer, including the name of the fund and its percentage increase.\n\nBy following this new plan, we aim to systematically gather and verify the necessary data, ensuring we avoid the previous issues and efficiently complete the task."}

The request is about a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Fund.\n   - The transaction fees for the fund are $0.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n   - One identified fund is the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-ACC-USD (ISIN: LU0261950470), which has a 19.7% return over the 5-year period ending June 30, 2025.\n   - The Fidelity website is experiencing technical issues, making it difficult to directly access the performance pages for specific funds.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds available during the specified time period.\n   - The performance data (percentage increase) of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - The transaction fee information for each of these funds to confirm they have $0 transaction fees.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news sites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n   - Additional funds to check include:\n     - Fidelity ® Emerging Markets Fund (Symbol: FEMKX)\n     - Fidelity Funds - Instl Emerging Markets Equity Fund I-ACC-USD\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each relevant fund over the specified period.\n   - The identification of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Fidelity likely has multiple Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance of these funds can vary significantly, and economic conditions, market trends, and specific investment strategies will influence their performance.\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is possible that some funds may have experienced negative returns or very low positive returns.\n   - Based on the performance data of the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-ACC-USD, it is reasonable to expect that other funds in this category may also have similar or varying performance metrics.\n   - The Fidelity ® Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) is a well-known fund and is likely to have comprehensive performance data available on Fidelity's official website or financial databases like Morningstar.\n   - Due to the technical issues with Fidelity's website, it may be more reliable to use alternative sources like Morningstar for performance data.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The addition of the Fidelity ® Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) and the Fidelity Funds - Instl Emerging Markets Equity Fund I-ACC-USD is based on the search results and the likelihood that these are prominent funds in the category.\n- The performance data of the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-ACC-USD provides a benchmark for what to expect from other funds in the same category.\n- The assumption that Fidelity's official website and financial databases like Morningstar will have detailed performance data for these funds is based on the typical practices of financial institutions and the availability of such data for other mutual funds.\n- Given the technical issues with Fidelity's website, it is prudent to rely on alternative sources like Morningstar to ensure we can access the necessary performance data.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific search terms to find the required data.\n   - Example: \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024 site:morningstar.com\".\n\n2. **Systematic Data Collection**:\n   - Create a list of all relevant Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - For each fund, navigate to its performance page on Morningstar and extract the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n\n3. **Use Multiple Sources**:\n   - Cross-reference data from Morningstar with any available data from Fidelity's official website once the technical issues are resolved.\n   - Use the WebSurfer to navigate and extract data from both sources.\n\n4. **Handle Technical Issues**:\n   - Ensure the WebSurfer waits for pages to fully load before extracting data.\n   - Retry failed searches or page loads to avoid missing important information.\n\n5. **Consolidate and Compare Data**:\n   - Compile the performance data for all identified funds.\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase over the specified period.\n\n6. **Summarize and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - Summarize the findings and provide the final answer, including the name of the fund and its percentage increase.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Search for Relevant Funds on Morningstar**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a search using the query \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024 site:morningstar.com\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of relevant funds and their performance pages.\n\n2. **Navigate to Each Fund's Performance Page on Morningstar**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each fund identified, navigate to its performance page on Morningstar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the performance section and extract the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference with Fidelity's Website**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the technical issues with Fidelity's website are resolved, cross-reference the data with Fidelity's official website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract any additional performance data or transaction fee information.\n\n4. **Handle Technical Issues**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the `sleep` function to wait for pages to fully load before extracting data.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Retry failed searches or page loads to ensure data completeness.\n\n5. **Compile and Compare Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the performance data for all identified funds.\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase over the specified period.\n\n6. **Summarize and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the final answer, including the name of the fund and its percentage increase.\n\nBy following this updated plan, we aim to systematically gather and verify the necessary data, ensuring we avoid the previous issues and efficiently complete the task.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Technical Issues with Fidelity's Website**:\n   - The Fidelity website encountered HTTP/2 protocol errors, preventing us from accessing the performance pages of the mutual funds.\n   - Repeated attempts to navigate to the performance pages resulted in the same error, indicating a persistent issue with the website.\n\n2. **Inefficient Search Strategy**:\n   - The search queries used were too specific and may not have returned the most relevant results, leading to dead ends or error-prone links.\n   - Relying solely on Fidelity's website for data extraction was a single point of failure.\n\n3. **Lack of Backup Plan**:\n   - No alternative sources were immediately utilized when the primary source (Fidelity's website) failed.\n   - This lack of redundancy led to repeated failures and wasted time.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Alternative Sources**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a search using the query \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024 site:morningstar.com\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of relevant funds and their performance pages from Morningstar.\n\n2. **Systematic Data Collection**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each fund identified, navigate to its performance page on Morningstar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the performance section and extract the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure to wait for the page to fully load using the `sleep` function if necessary.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference with Fidelity's Website (if possible)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the technical issues with Fidelity's website are resolved, cross-reference the data with Fidelity's official website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract any additional performance data or transaction fee information.\n\n4. **Handle Technical Issues**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the `sleep` function to wait for pages to fully load before extracting data.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Retry failed searches or page loads to ensure data completeness.\n\n5. **Compile and Compare Data**:\n   -

**Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the final answer, including the name of the fund and its percentage increase.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Search for Relevant Funds on Morningstar**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a search using the query \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024 site:morningstar.com\".\n   -

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Fund.\n- The transaction fees for the fund are $0.\n- The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n- One identified fund is the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-ACC-USD (ISIN: LU0261950470), which has a 19.7% return over the 5-year period ending June 30, 2025.\n- The Fidelity website is experiencing technical issues, making it difficult to directly access the performance pages for specific funds.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds available during the specified time period.\n- The performance data (percentage increase) of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- The transaction fee information for each of these funds to confirm they have $0 transaction fees.\n- These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news sites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n- Additional funds to check include:\n  - Fidelity ® Emerging Markets Fund (Symbol: FEMKX)\n  - Fidelity Funds - Instl Emerging Markets Equity Fund I-ACC-USD\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The percentage increase for each relevant fund over the specified period.\n- The identification of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Fidelity likely has multiple Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.**\n  - Reasoning: Fidelity offers a wide range of mutual funds, and while some may have $0 transaction fees, others might not. It is essential to verify this information for each fund.\n- **The performance of these funds can vary significantly, and economic conditions, market trends, and specific investment strategies will influence their performance.**\n  - Reasoning: Emerging markets are known for their volatility, and different funds may have different investment strategies, leading to varied performance outcomes.\n- **Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is possible that some funds may have experienced negative returns or very low positive returns.**\n  - Reasoning: The economic and political conditions in emerging markets can lead to significant fluctuations in fund performance.\n- **Based on the performance data of the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-ACC-USD, it is reasonable to expect that other funds in this category may also have similar or varying performance metrics.**\n  - Reasoning: The 19.7% return over the 5-year period for the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-ACC-USD provides a benchmark, but other funds may have performed differently.\n- **The Fidelity ® Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) is a well-known fund and is likely to have comprehensive performance data available on Fidelity's official website or financial databases like Morningstar.**\n  - Reasoning: As a prominent fund, FEMKX is likely to be well-documented and have detailed performance data available.\n- **Due to the technical issues with Fidelity's website, it may be more reliable to use alternative sources like Morningstar for performance data.**\n  - Reasoning: Morningstar is a reputable financial database that provides comprehensive performance data for mutual funds, making it a reliable alternative source.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific search terms to find the required data.\n   - Example: \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024 site:morningstar.com\".\n\n2. **Systematic Data Collection**:\n   - Create a list of all relevant Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - For each fund, navigate to its performance page on Morningstar and extract the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n\n3. **Use Multiple Sources**:\n   - Cross-reference data from Morningstar with any available data from Fidelity's official website once the technical issues are resolved.\n   - Use the WebSurfer to navigate and extract data from both sources.\n\n4. **Handle Technical Issues**:\n   - Ensure the WebSurfer waits for pages to fully load before extracting data.\n   - Retry failed searches or page loads to avoid missing important information.\n\n5. **Consolidate and Compare Data**:\n   - Compile the performance data for all identified funds.\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase over the specified period.\n\n6. **Summarize and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - Summarize the findings and provide the final answer, including the name of the fund and its percentage increase.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Search for Relevant Funds on Morningstar**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a search using the query \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024 site:morningstar.com\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of relevant funds and their performance pages.\n\n2. **Navigate to Each Fund's Performance Page on Morningstar**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each fund identified, navigate to its performance page on Morningstar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the performance section and extract the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the `sleep` function to wait for pages to fully load before extracting data.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference with Fidelity's Website**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the technical issues with Fidelity's website are resolved, cross-reference the data with Fidelity's official website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract any additional performance data or transaction fee information.\n\n4. **Handle Technical Issues**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the `sleep` function to wait for pages to fully load before extracting data.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Retry failed searches or page loads to ensure data completeness.\n\n5. **Compile and Compare Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the performance data for all identified funds.\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase over the specified period.\n\n6. **Summarize and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the final answer, including the name of the fund and its percentage increase.\n\nBy following this updated plan, we aim to systematically gather and verify the necessary data, ensuring we avoid the previous issues and efficiently complete the task.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Technical Issues with Fidelity's Website**:\n   - The Fidelity website encountered HTTP/2 protocol errors, preventing us from accessing the performance pages of the mutual funds.\n   - Repeated attempts to navigate to the performance pages resulted in the same error, indicating a persistent issue with the website.\n\n2. **Inefficient Search Strategy**:\n   - The search queries used were too specific and may not have returned the most relevant results, leading to dead ends or error-prone links.\n   - Relying solely on Fidelity's website for data extraction was a single point of failure.\n\n3. **Lack of Backup Plan**:\n   - No alternative sources were immediately utilized when the primary source (Fidelity's website) failed.\n   - This lack of redundancy led to repeated failures and wasted time.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Alternative Sources**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a search using the query \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024 site:morningstar.com\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of relevant funds and their performance pages from Morningstar.\n\n2. **Systematic Data Collection**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each fund identified, navigate to its performance page on Morningstar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the performance section and extract the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the `sleep` function to wait for pages to fully load before extracting data.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference with Fidelity's Website (if possible)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the technical issues with Fidelity's website are resolved, cross-reference the data with Fidelity's official website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract any additional performance data or transaction fee information.\n\n4. **Handle Technical Issues**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the `sleep` function to wait for pages to fully load before extracting data.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Retry failed searches or page loads to ensure data completeness.\n\n5. **Compile and Compare Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the performance data for all identified funds.\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase over the specified period.\n\n6. **Summarize and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the final answer, including the name of the fund and its percentage increase.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Search for Relevant Funds on Morningstar**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a search using the query \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024 site:morningstar.com\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of relevant funds and their performance pages.\n\n2. **Navigate to Each Fund's Performance Page on Morningstar**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each fund identified, navigate to its performance page on Morningstar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the performance section and extract the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the `sleep` function to wait for pages to fully load before extracting data.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference with Fidelity's Website (if possible)**:\n   -
