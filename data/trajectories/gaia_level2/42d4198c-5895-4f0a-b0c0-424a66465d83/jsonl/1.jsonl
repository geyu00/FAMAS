{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - We need to find the number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for this game before the month listed as its release date.\n   - The release date is based on the information available on the Wikipedia page as of the most recent entry from 2022.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards.\n   - The release date of the game as listed on its Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022).\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page for the game, specifically the number of revisions before the month of the release date.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the month of the game's release date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019 is likely to be a well-known and critically acclaimed title.\n   - The release date of the game is likely to be clearly stated on the Wikipedia page.\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the release date will require checking the page's revision history.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the 2019 British Academy Games Award Winner:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for the winner of the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n  \n- **Find the Release Date:**\n  - Once the game's name is identified, use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page for the game.\n  - Extract the release date of the game as listed on the Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022).\n\n- **Check Revision History:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the \"View history\" tab of the Wikipedia page.\n  - Use WebSurfer to count the number of revisions made before the month of the game's release date.\n\n- **Report the Results:**\n  - Summarize the findings, including the name of the game, its release date, and the number of revisions before the release date."}

The game was released worldwide for the \nPlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a \nWindows port released in January 2022. It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are basically 2 protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and \ngods of the Norse world.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"God of War (2018 video game)\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2016-06-14T19:06:41Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-16T13:09:35Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"headline\": \"2018 action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by Santa Monica Studio\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"853\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"God of War (2018 video game) - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019 is \"God of War.\"\n   - The game \"God of War\" was released worldwide for the PlayStation 4 in April 2018.\n   - We need to find the number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" before April 2018.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" before April 2018.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the month of the game's release date (April 2018).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The game \"God of War\" is a well-known and critically acclaimed title, which suggests that its Wikipedia page likely had a significant number of revisions even before its release.\n   - The release date of \"God of War\" is clearly stated on the Wikipedia page, which simplifies the task of identifying the relevant period for counting revisions.\n   - Given the popularity and anticipation of \"God of War,\" it is reasonable to expect that the Wikipedia page saw frequent updates and contributions from both fans and editors leading up to its release.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Popularity and Anticipation:** \"God of War\" is a highly anticipated and well-received game, which typically results in a lot of community interest and activity on platforms like Wikipedia. This suggests that the page would have seen numerous revisions as new information became available.\n- **Clear Release Date:** The release date being clearly stated on the Wikipedia page makes it straightforward to identify the cutoff point for counting revisions.\n- **Community Engagement:** The active community around the \"God of War\" franchise is likely to have contributed to a high number of edits and updates, especially as the release date approached.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Excessive Context Length:** The error occurred because the model's maximum context length was exceeded. This happened due to the large amount of data being processed, particularly when trying to count the revisions on the Wikipedia page.\n- **Inefficient Scrolling and Counting:** The repeated scrolling and manual counting of revisions were inefficient and led to the accumulation of a large amount of context, eventually causing the model to exceed its token limit.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Wikipedia Page:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page for \"God of War (2018 video game).\"\n\n2. **Find the Release Date:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to locate and extract the release date of \"God of War\" from the Wikipedia page.\n\n3. **Navigate to the Revision History:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the \"View history\" tab of the Wikipedia page.\n\n4. **Count Revisions Efficiently:**\n   - Instead of manually scrolling through the entire revision history, use WebSurfer to:\n     - Load the revision history page.\n     - Extract the total number of revisions using a script to parse the page content.\n     - Filter the revisions to count only those made before April 2018.\n\n5. **Summarize the Findings:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to summarize the findings, including the name of the game, its release date, and the number of revisions before the release date.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Wikipedia Page**\n  ```python\n  web_surfer.navigate_to(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 2: Find the Release Date**\n  ```python\n  release_date = web_surfer.extract_text_from_element(\"div.mw-parser-output > p\", \"April 2018\")\n  print(f\"Release Date: {release_date}\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 3: Navigate to the Revision History**\n  ```python\n  web_surfer.click_element(\"a[title='View history']\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 4: Count Revisions Efficiently**\n  ```python\n  # Load the revision history page\n  web_surfer.wait_for_page_load()\n\n  # Extract the total number of revisions\n  total_revisions = web_surfer.extract_text_from_element(\"span.mw-history-histtotal\", \"Total revisions: 0\")\n\n  # Filter revisions to count only those made before April 2018\n  revisions_before_release = 0\n  revisions = web_surfer.extract_elements(\"li.mw-changeslist-line\")\n  for revision in revisions:\n      date = web_surfer.extract_text_from_element(\"a.mw-changeslist-date\", \"2025-07-16\")\n      if date < \"2018-04-01\":\n          revisions_before_release += 1\n\n  print(f\"Total Revisions Before Release: {revisions_before_release}\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 5: Summarize the Findings**\n  ```python\n  print(f\"Game: God of War (2018 video game)\")\n  print(f\"Release Date: {release_date}\")\n  print(f\"Number of Revisions Before Release: {revisions_before_release}\")\n  ```\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Limit Context Length:** Ensure that the context length is kept within the model's limits by processing and summarizing information in smaller chunks.\n- **Use Efficient Parsing:** Utilize efficient parsing techniques to extract and filter the necessary data without loading the entire page content into the context.\n- **Automate Where Possible:** Automate the process of navigating, extracting, and filtering data to minimize manual intervention and reduce the risk of exceeding context limits."}

The game was released worldwide for the \nPlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a \nWindows port released in January 2022. It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are basically 2 protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and \ngods of the Norse world.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"God of War (2018 video game)\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2016-06-14T19:06:41Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-16T13:09:35Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"headline\": \"2018 action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by Santa Monica Studio\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"853\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"God of War (2018 video game) - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019 is \"God of War.\"\n   - The game \"God of War\" was released worldwide for the PlayStation 4 in April 2018.\n   - We need to find the number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" before April 2018.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" before April 2018.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the month of the game's release date (April 2018).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **High Community Interest:** \"God of War\" is a highly anticipated and well-received game, which suggests that its Wikipedia page likely had a significant number of revisions even before its release.\n   - **Clear Release Date:** The release date of \"God of War\" is clearly stated on the Wikipedia page, which simplifies the task of identifying the relevant period for counting revisions.\n   - **Active Community:** The active community around the \"God of War\" franchise is likely to have contributed to a high number of edits and updates, especially as the release date approached.\n   - **Frequent Updates:** Given the game's status and the community's engagement, it is reasonable to expect that the Wikipedia page saw frequent updates and contributions, possibly multiple revisions per day, especially in the months leading up to the release.\n   - **Significant Pre-Release Activity:** The pre-release period for \"God of War\" likely saw a surge in edits as new trailers, gameplay footage, and developer interviews were released, providing more information for the Wikipedia page.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **High Community Interest:** \"God of War\" is part of a long-running and beloved franchise, which means there was a lot of anticipation and interest from fans. This typically leads to a lot of activity on platforms like Wikipedia.\n- **Clear Release Date:** Having a clear release date makes it easier to filter and count revisions, ensuring accuracy in our count.\n- **Active Community:** The \"God of War\" community is known for being very active and engaged, which likely translated into frequent updates and contributions to the Wikipedia page.\n- **Frequent Updates:** Major announcements, such as trailers and gameplay reveals, often lead to immediate updates on the Wikipedia page, resulting in a higher number of revisions.\n- **Significant Pre-Release Activity:** The months leading up to the release of a highly anticipated game are usually filled with a lot of news and media coverage, which would drive a lot of edits to the Wikipedia page.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Wikipedia Page:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page for \"God of War (2018 video game).\"\n\n2. **Find the Release Date:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to locate and extract the release date of \"God of War\" from the Wikipedia page.\n\n3. **Navigate to the Revision History:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the \"View history\" tab of the Wikipedia page.\n\n4. **Count Revisions Efficiently:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to:\n     - Load the revision history page.\n     - Extract the total number of revisions using a script to parse the page content.\n     - Filter the revisions to count only those made before April 2018.\n\n5. **Summarize the Findings:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to summarize the findings, including the name of the game, its release date, and the number of revisions before the release date.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Wikipedia Page**\n  ```python\n  web_surfer.navigate_to(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 2: Find the Release Date**\n  ```python\n  release_date = web_surfer.extract_text_from_element(\"div.mw-parser-output > p\", \"April 2018\")\n  print(f\"Release Date: {release_date}\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 3: Navigate to the Revision History**\n  ```python\n  web_surfer.click_element(\"a[title='View history']\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 4: Count Revisions Efficiently**\n  ```python\n  # Load the revision history page\n  web_surfer.wait_for_page_load()\n\n  # Extract the total number of revisions\n  total_revisions = web_surfer.extract_text_from_element(\"span.mw-history-histtotal\", \"Total revisions: 0\")\n\n  # Filter revisions to count only those made before April 2018\n  revisions_before_release = 0\n  revisions = web_surfer.extract_elements(\"li.mw-changeslist-line\")\n  for revision in revisions:\n      date = web_surfer.extract_text_from_element(\"a.mw-changeslist-date\", \"2025-07-16\")\n      if date < \"2018-04-01\":\n          revisions_before_release += 1\n\n  print(f\"Total Revisions Before Release: {revisions_before_release}\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 5: Summarize the Findings**\n  ```python\n  print(f\"Game: God of War (2018 video game)\")\n  print(f\"Release Date: {release_date}\")\n  print(f\"Number of Revisions Before Release: {revisions_before_release}\")\n  ```\n\nLet's proceed with these steps to get the accurate count of revisions before April 2018.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Excessive Context Length:** The model's maximum context length was exceeded due to the large amount of data being processed, particularly when trying to count the revisions on the Wikipedia page.\n- **Inefficient Scrolling and Counting:** The repeated scrolling and manual counting of revisions were inefficient and led to the accumulation of a large amount of context, eventually causing the model to exceed its token limit.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Wikipedia Page:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page for \"God of War (2018 video game).\"\n\n2. **Extract the Release Date:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to locate and extract the release date of \"God of War\" from the Wikipedia page.\n\n3. **Navigate to the Revision History:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the \"View history\" tab of the Wikipedia page.\n\n4. **Load and Parse the Revision History:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to load the revision history page.\n   - Use a Python script to parse the HTML content of the revision history page and extract the dates of each revision.\n   - Filter the revisions to count only those made before April 2018.\n\n5. **Summarize the Findings:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to summarize the findings, including the name of the game, its release date, and the number of revisions before the release date.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Wikipedia Page**\n  ```python\n  web_surfer.navigate_to(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 2: Extract the Release Date**\n  ```python\n  release_date = web_surfer.extract_text_from_element(\"div.mw-parser-output > p\", \"April 2018\")\n  print(f\"Release Date: {release_date}\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 3: Navigate to the Revision History**\n  ```python\n  web_surfer.click_element(\"a[title='View history']\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 4: Load and Parse the Revision History**\n  ```python\n  # Load the revision history page\n  web_surfer.wait_for_page_load()\n\n  # Extract the HTML content of the revision history page\n  html_content = web_surfer.get_page_source()\n\n  # Use a Python script to parse the HTML content and extract revision dates\n  import re\n\n  # Regular expression to match revision dates\n  date_pattern = r'\\b\\d{1,2} \\w{3} \\d{4}\\b'\n\n  # Extract all revision dates\n  revision_dates = re.findall(date_pattern, html_content)\n\n  # Convert dates to a standard format (YYYY-MM-DD)\n  from datetime import datetime\n  formatted_dates = [datetime.strptime(date, '%d %b %Y').strftime('%Y-%m-%d') for date in revision_dates]\n\n  # Filter revisions to count only those made before April 2018\n  revisions_before_release = [date for date in formatted_dates if date < '2018-04-01']\n  revisions_count = len(revisions_before_release)\n\n  print(f\"Total Revisions Before Release: {revisions_count}\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 5: Summarize the Findings**\n  ```python\n  print(f\"Game: God of War (2018 video game)\")\n  print(f\"Release Date: {release_date}\")\n  print(f\"Number of Revisions Before Release: {revisions_count}\")\n  ```\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Limit Context Length:** Ensure that the context length is kept within the model's limits by processing and summarizing information in smaller chunks.\n- **Use Efficient Parsing:** Utilize efficient parsing techniques to extract and filter the necessary data without loading the entire page content into the context.\n- **Automate Where Possible:** Automate the process of navigating, extracting, and filtering data to minimize manual intervention and reduce the risk of exceeding context limits."}

The game was released worldwide for the \nPlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a \nWindows port released in January 2022. It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are basically 2 protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and \ngods of the Norse world.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"God of War (2018 video game)\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2016-06-14T19:06:41Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-16T13:09:35Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"headline\": \"2018 action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by Santa Monica Studio\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"853\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"God of War (2018 video game) - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
