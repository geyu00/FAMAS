However, the script is currently returning an error. We need to debug the script and correct it.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Review the provided Python script to identify any syntax or logical errors.\n2. Correct the identified errors in the script.\n3. Test the corrected script with a sample input to ensure it works as expected.\n\n## Output format\n- The corrected Python script\n- The output of the script when tested with a sample input\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The script should correctly process the list of numbers and return the sum of the squares of the even numbers.\n- The script should handle edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with no even numbers.\n\n## Provided Python script\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\nresult = sum_of_squares_even(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```"}

The task is to compute the sum of the squares of even numbers from the list of `numbers`.\n\nHere’s the provided script:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\nresult = sum_of_squares_even(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nUpon reviewing the script, it appears to be logically sound and syntactically correct. It should correctly calculate the sum of squares of even numbers from the list. Let’s test this script using the provided sample input.\n\nI will execute the corrected Python script to verify that it works as expected. The expected output for the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` should be:\n\n- Even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\n- Sum of their squares: \\(2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 8^2 + 10^2 = 4 + 16 + 36 + 64 + 100 = 220\\)\n\nNow, let’s execute the Python script in the Computer_terminal. \n\n```python\n# filename: sum_of_squares_even.py\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\nresult = sum_of_squares_even(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```"}
