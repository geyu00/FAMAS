Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expressed distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of the journal (which is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house).\n   - The specific word quoted from two different authors.\n   - The identities of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n   - The exact context and content of the article where the word is used.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house (from Norse mythology).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The journal is likely named after Fafnir, one of Hreidmar's sons who famously turned into a dragon in Norse mythology.\n   - The word in question might be something like \"cliché,\" \"stereotypical,\" or \"overused,\" given the context of expressing distaste for dragon depictions.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Name of the Journal:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for the name of the journal named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house. Focus on Norse mythology resources to confirm the name (likely Fafnir).\n\n- **Locate Emily Midkiff's Article:**\n  - Once the journal name is confirmed, use WebSurfer to find Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the identified journal.\n\n- **Extract the Quoted Word:**\n  - Have WebSurfer navigate to the article and locate the section where the word is quoted from two different authors.\n  - Extract the specific word and the context in which it is used.\n\n- **Verify the Authors:**\n  - Confirm the identities of the two authors whose quotes are used in the article.\n\n- **Summarize the Findings:**\n  - Compile the information into a concise summary, including the name of the journal, the quoted word, and the authors' names."}

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children’s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children’s literature dragons.

Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expressed distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - The journal is named \"Fafnir\" (verified from the search results).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific word quoted from two different authors.\n   - The identities of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n   - The exact context and content of the article where the word is used.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house (from Norse mythology) is Fafnir.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The word in question might be something like \"cliché,\" \"stereotypical,\" or \"overused,\" given the context of expressing distaste for dragon depictions.\n   - The word could be related to the trend of softening and satirizing dragons in children's literature, as mentioned in the abstract of the article.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The abstract of the article mentions a trend to soften and satirize dragons in children's literature, which suggests that the word in question could be related to this trend.\n- Given the context of the article and the abstract, words like \"cliché,\" \"stereotypical,\" or \"overused\" fit well with the idea of expressing distaste for the way dragons are often depicted in modern children's literature.\n\nNext steps:\n- Navigate to the PDF version of the article and locate the section where the word is quoted from two different authors.\n- Extract the specific word, the identities of the two authors, and the context in which it is used.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Repetition of Actions**: We repeatedly clicked on the \"READ ONLINE\" link without navigating to the actual PDF version of the article, which is where the detailed content is located.\n2. **Lack of Specific Navigation**: We did not explicitly instruct the WebSurfer to navigate to the PDF version of the article, which is necessary to access the full text.\n3. **Insufficient Context Extraction**: Even when we accessed the correct page, we did not systematically search for the specific word and context within the article.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the PDF Version**:\n   - Instruct WebSurfer to click on the \"READ ONLINE\" link to access the article.\n   - If the PDF version is available, download the PDF using WebSurfer.\n\n2. **Search for the Specific Word**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to search for keywords like \"cliché,\" \"stereotypical,\" \"overused,\" and other similar terms within the article.\n   - Look for sections where the author discusses the nature of dragon depictions and quotes other authors.\n\n3. **Extract the Word and Context**:\n   - Identify the specific word quoted from two different authors.\n   - Note the identities of the two authors.\n   - Extract the exact context in which the word is used.\n\n4. **Summarize the Findings**:\n   - Compile the information into a concise summary, including the name of the journal, the quoted word, the authors' names, and the context.\n\n### New Plan in Bullet Points\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the PDF Version**\n  - Click on the \"READ ONLINE\" link to access the article.\n  - If the PDF version is available, download the PDF.\n\n- **Step 2: Search for the Specific Word**\n  - Search for keywords like \"cliché,\" \"stereotypical,\" \"overused,\" and other similar terms within the article.\n  - Look for sections where the author discusses the nature of dragon depictions and quotes other authors.\n\n- **Step 3: Extract the Word and Context**\n  - Identify the specific word quoted from two different authors.\n  - Note the identities of the two authors.\n  - Extract the exact context in which the word is used.\n\n- **Step 4: Summarize the Findings**\n  - Compile the information into a concise summary, including the name of the journal, the quoted word, the authors' names, and the context.\n\n### Execution\n\nCan you click on the \"READ ONLINE\" link to access the article and, if available, download the PDF version?

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children’s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children’s literature dragons.

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children’s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children’s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.\nISSN:\n2342-2009 \n Dragons, Tigers, and Taoism by: David Shalom Strecker \nPublished: (2020-12-01) \n © 2020 | Services hosted by the \nPerpustakaan Tun Abdul Razak, | \nUniversiti Teknologi MARA | \nDisclaimer\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

This   disconnect   with   traditional\ndragons   has   been   bemoaned   as   ruining   the   mythic   and   archetypal   power   of\ndragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than\nreadily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore:\nthe eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore,\nfrom which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary\nbeasts,   but   they   also   created   a   distinctly   unsettling   atmosphere   in   their   stories.\nModern   tamed   and   human-like   children’s   literature   dragons   borrow   certain\nuncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not\nalways   life-threatening   characters.   In   specific,   two   traits   borrowed   from   the\noriginal lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’\nintensely   possessive   gaze   and   their   clever,   manipulative   speech.   This   article\nanalyzes   these  Freudian   inheritances   to   argue   that   children’s   literature   dragons\nhave   not   been   entirely   softened   and   satirized;   the   potential   for   uncanny   fear\nembodied by  the human-like  behaviors  of legendary Western dragons  lingers  in\nmany modern children’s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are\nstill   strong   characters   and   can   and   should   be   analyzed   productively   through   a\nFreudian uncanny lens.\n\nKeywords: Dragon, uncanny, Freud, children’s literature\n\nBiography and contact info: Emily Midkiff (MA, English and Children's Literature) is teaching and\nworking on her PhD at the University of Minnesota.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien once declared that “the dragon in legend is a potent creation of men’s imagination,\nricher in significance than his barrow is in gold” (“The Monsters” 16).

In modern literature, dragons have\nflourished in their newer realm of fantasy and children’s literature as one of its most pervasive\nmythic animals.\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n41\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nThe Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature\n\nYet   within   children’s   literature,   scholars   have   noted   a   trend   beginning   even   before   the\ndragon’s mass popularity in fantasy to soften and satirize the dragon for children.
