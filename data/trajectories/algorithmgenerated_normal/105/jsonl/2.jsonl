{"agent": "Local_Knowledge_Expert", "content": "To begin solving the task of identifying gyms within a 200-meter radius of Tompkins Square Park that offer fitness classes before 7am, I will first locate the gyms in that area.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Gyms Near Tompkins Square Park**\n\nI will use geolocation data to pinpoint gyms within a 200-meter radius of Tompkins Square Park. The approximate coordinates for Tompkins Square Park are 40.7308° N, 73.9733° W.\n\nLet's check for gyms in this area using a mapping service or database. I will draft a Python script for this task. \n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Coordinates for Tompkins Square Park\nlatitude = 40.7308\nlongitude = -73.9733\nradius = 200  # in meters\n\n# Function to find gyms using a mock API endpoint\ndef find_gyms_near_park(latitude, longitude, radius):\n    # This URL is a placeholder. Replace it with a real API endpoint that provides gym data.\n    url = f\"https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search?term=gyms&latitude={latitude}&longitude={longitude}&radius={radius}\"\n    \n    headers = {\n        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_YELP_API_KEY',  # Replace with your actual API key\n    }\n\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    return response.json()\n\n# Find gyms near Tompkins Square Park\ngyms_data = find_gyms_near_park(latitude, longitude, radius)\ngyms_data  # This will contain the gym information\n```\n\nI'll now run this script to get the gym data."}
