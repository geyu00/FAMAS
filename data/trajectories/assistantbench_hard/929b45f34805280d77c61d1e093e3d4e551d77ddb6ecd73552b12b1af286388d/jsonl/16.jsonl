{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe dog genome was first mapped in 2004 and has been updated several times since. What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The exact location or database where these files can be accessed.\n   - Any updates or revisions to the dog genome between 2004 and May 2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which version of the dog genome was considered the most relevant in May 2020 based on the latest research and publications at that time.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files in May 2020 are likely to be hosted on a major genomics database such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or Ensembl.\n   - The version of the dog genome most relevant in May 2020 might be CanFam3.1, which was a significant update released in 2011, but it would need verification.\n   - There could have been additional minor updates or annotations added to the genome between 2011 and 2020, which might also be relevant.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search to find the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Visit authoritative genomics databases like NCBI or Ensembl to locate the specific version and release date of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020.\n\n- **Locate the files:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Once the specific version is identified, navigate to the download page on the authoritative database (NCBI or Ensembl) to find the link to the relevant files.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Verify the file formats and any additional metadata that might be useful.\n\n- **Summarize the findings:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Summarize the version of the dog genome, the release date, and the direct link to the files.\n  - **Assistant:** Compile the information into a clear and concise response to the original request."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe dog genome was first mapped in 2004 and has been updated several times since. What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The Dog10K database (https://dog10k.kiz.ac.cn) provides a platform for users to browse, search, analyze, and download canine multi-omics data, including various versions of the dog genome.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The exact location or database where these files can be accessed.\n   - Any updates or revisions to the dog genome between 2004 and May 2020, particularly focusing on the versions available in the Dog10K database.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which version of the dog genome was considered the most relevant in May 2020 based on the latest research and publications at that time.\n   - Identifying the specific files and their formats for the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020 from the Dog10K database.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files in May 2020 are likely to be hosted on a major genomics database such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or Ensembl, but the Dog10K database is also a significant resource.\n   - The version of the dog genome most relevant in May 2020 might be CanFam3.1, which was a significant update released in 2011. However, given the ongoing updates and the presence of newer versions in the Dog10K database, it is possible that a more recent version, such as CanFam4 or CanFam5, might have been more relevant.\n   - The Dog10K database lists multiple versions of the dog genome, including CanFam3.1, CanFam4, CanFam5, and CanFam6. Given the timeline, CanFam4 (UU_Cfam_GSD_1.0) or CanFam5 (UMICH_Zoey_3.1) are strong candidates for being the most relevant in May 2020.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The Dog10K database provides a comprehensive list of genome versions, and the versions listed (CanFam3.1, CanFam4, CanFam5, and CanFam6) suggest that there have been significant updates since the initial mapping in 2004.\n- CanFam4 and CanFam5 were released after CanFam3.1 and are more recent, making them more likely to be the most relevant in May 2020.\n- The presence of CanFam6 (Dog10K_Boxer_Tasha) indicates that even more recent updates exist, but it is less likely to have been the most relevant in May 2020 given its later release date.\n\nNext steps:\n- Verify the release dates of CanFam4 and CanFam5 to confirm their relevance in May 2020.\n- Check the NCBI or Ensembl databases to cross-reference the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020.\n- Identify the direct links to the files for the most relevant version of the dog genome.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Version Identification**: Despite visiting the Dog10K database, we did not explicitly identify the specific version of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020. We only listed the available versions without verifying which one was the most relevant during that period.\n2. **Insufficient Cross-Verification**: We did not cross-verify the information from the Dog10K database with other authoritative sources like NCBI or Ensembl, which could have provided more context and confirmation.\n3. **Incomplete Data Collection**: We did not collect all necessary details, such as the exact release dates and links to the files for the most relevant version.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Identify the Most Relevant Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020, focusing on authoritative sources like NCBI or Ensembl.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the NCBI or Ensembl databases to locate the specific version and release date of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020.\n\n2. **Cross-Verify with Dog10K Database**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Dog10K database (https://dog10k.kiz.ac.cn) and cross-verify the identified version with the versions listed there.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure that the version identified is indeed the most relevant by checking the release dates and any relevant publications.\n\n3. **Locate the Files**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the specific version is confirmed, navigate to the download page on the authoritative database (NCBI or Ensembl) to find the link to the relevant files.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the file formats and any additional metadata that might be useful.\n\n4. **Summarize the Findings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the version of the dog genome, the release date, and the direct link to the files.\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the information into a clear and concise response to the original request.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Web Search for Relevant Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query \"most relevant version of dog genome in May 2020\" and focus on results from NCBI or Ensembl.\n\n2. **Visit NCBI or Ensembl**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the NCBI or Ensembl database and search for the dog genome.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the version of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020 and note the release date.\n\n3. **Cross-Verify with Dog10K Database**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Dog10K database (https://dog10k.kiz.ac.cn) and check the versions listed.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm the release dates and any relevant publications to ensure the version identified is the most relevant.\n\n4. **Locate and Verify Files**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the download page for the identified version on the authoritative database (NCBI or Ensembl).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the file formats and download links.\n\n5. **Summarize and Respond**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the version of the dog genome, the release date, and the direct link to the files.\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the information into a clear and concise response to the original request.\n\nBy following this plan, we will ensure that we identify the correct version of the dog genome, cross-verify the information, and provide the necessary links and details."}

Annotation with generated and existing long and short read RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and ATAC-seq, revealed that 32.1% of lifted over CanFam3.1 gaps harboured previously hidden functional elements, including promoters, genes and miRNAs in GSD_1.0. A catalogue of canine “dark” regions was made to facilitate mapping rescue. Alignment in these regions is difficult, but we demonstrate that they harbour trait-associated variation. Key genomic regions were completed, including the Dog Leucocyte Antigen (DLA), T Cell Receptor (TCR) and 366 COSMIC cancer genes. 10x linked-read sequencing of 27 dogs (19 breeds) uncovered 22.1 million SNPs, indels and larger structural variants. Subsequent intersection with protein coding genes showed that 1.4% of these could directly influence gene products, and so provide a source of normal or aberrant phenotypic modifications.\nDownload PDF\nSections\nFigures\nReferences\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nResults and discussion\nMethods\nData availability\nCode availability\nReferences\nAcknowledgements\nFunding\nAuthor information\nEthics declarations\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"mainEntity\": {\n            \"headline\": \"A novel canine reference genome resolves genomic architecture and uncovers transcript complexity\",\n            \"description\": \"We present GSD_1.0, a high-quality domestic dog reference genome with chromosome length scaffolds and contiguity increased 55-fold over CanFam3.1.

Here, the authors report an improved de novo reference genome for the domestic dog based on a female German Shepherd named Mischka. The new genome increases contiguity 55-fold over the previous dog assembly and uncovers functional elements that were not previously identifiable.\",\n            \"datePublished\":

55-fold over CanFam3.1. Annotation with generated and existing long and short read RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and ATAC-seq, revealed that 32.1% of lifted over&nbsp;CanFam3.1 gaps harboured previously hidden functional elements, including promoters, genes and miRNAs in GSD_1.0. A catalogue of canine \\u201cdark\\u201d regions was made to facilitate mapping rescue. Alignment in these regions is difficult, but we demonstrate that they harbour trait-associated variation. Key genomic regions were completed, including the Dog Leucocyte Antigen (DLA), T Cell Receptor (TCR) and 366 COSMIC cancer genes. 10x linked-read sequencing of 27 dogs (19 breeds) uncovered 22.1 million SNPs, indels and larger structural variants.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe dog genome was first mapped in 2004 and has been updated several times since. What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The Dog10K database (https://dog10k.kiz.ac.cn) provides a platform for users to browse, search, analyze, and download canine multi-omics data, including various versions of the dog genome.\n   - The Ensembl database currently uses the ROS_Cfam_1.0 (GCA_014441545.1) assembly for the dog genome.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The exact location or database where these files can be accessed.\n   - Any updates or revisions to the dog genome between 2004 and May 2020, particularly focusing on the versions available in the Dog10K database and other major databases like NCBI and Ensembl.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which version of the dog genome was considered the most relevant in May 2020 based on the latest research and publications at that time.\n   - Identifying the specific files and their formats for the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020 from the Dog10K database, NCBI, or Ensembl.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files in May 2020 are likely to be hosted on a major genomics database such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or Ensembl, but the Dog10K database is also a significant resource.\n   - The version of the dog genome most relevant in May 2020 might be CanFam3.1, which was a significant update released in 2011. However, given the ongoing updates and the presence of newer versions in the Dog10K database, it is possible that a more recent version, such as CanFam4 or CanFam5, might have been more relevant.\n   - The Dog10K database lists multiple versions of the dog genome, including CanFam3.1, CanFam4, CanFam5, and CanFam6. Given the timeline, CanFam4 (UU_Cfam_GSD_1.0) or CanFam5 (UMICH_Zoey_3.1) are strong candidates for being the most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The Ensembl database currently uses the ROS_Cfam_1.0 (GCA_014441545.1) assembly, which suggests that this version might have been relevant in May 2020, but we need to verify its release date.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The Dog10K database provides a comprehensive list of genome versions, and the versions listed (CanFam3.1, CanFam4, CanFam5, and CanFam6) suggest that there have been significant updates since the initial mapping in 2004.\n- CanFam4 and CanFam5 were released after CanFam3.1 and are more recent, making them more likely to be the most relevant in May 2020.\n- The presence of CanFam6 (Dog10K_Boxer_Tasha) indicates that even more recent updates exist, but it is less likely to have been the most relevant in May 2020 given its later release date.\n- The Ensembl database currently uses the ROS_Cfam_1.0 (GCA_014441545.1) assembly, which suggests that this version might have been relevant in May 2020, but we need to verify its release date to confirm.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Verify the Release Dates of CanFam4 and CanFam5:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find the release dates of CanFam4 and CanFam5.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check the Dog10K database and other major databases like NCBI and Ensembl for the release dates of these versions.\n\n2. **Check the NCBI or Ensembl Databases:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=dog) and Ensembl database (https://www.ensembl.org/Canis_lupus_familiaris/Info/Index) to cross-reference the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the direct links to the files for the most relevant version of the dog genome.\n\n3. **Identify the Direct Links to the Files:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the specific version is confirmed, navigate to the download page on the authoritative database (NCBI or Ensembl) to find the link to the relevant files.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the file formats and download links.\n\nBy following these steps, we will ensure that we identify the correct version of the dog genome, cross-verify the information, and provide the necessary links and details.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Access Issues with NCBI**:\n   - The NCBI website blocked access due to a possible misuse/abuse situation, preventing us from accessing the relevant information directly from NCBI.\n   \n2. **Incorrect URLs and Redirects**:\n   - There were issues with incorrect URLs and redirects, leading to 404 errors or being redirected to regional mirrors, which sometimes did not contain the necessary information.\n\n3. **Inadequate Verification of Versions**:\n   - We did not thoroughly verify the release dates and relevance of the different versions of the dog genome, leading to uncertainty about which version was most relevant in May 2020.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Avoid NCBI Access Issues**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query 'most relevant version of dog genome in May 2020 alternative sources' to find reliable sources such as academic papers, research articles, or other genomic databases.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the specific version of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020, along with its release date and the direct link to the files.\n\n2. **Use Ensembl for Verification**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Ensembl database (https://www.ensembl.org/Canis_lupus_familiaris/Info/Index) and verify the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check the release dates and download links for the identified version.\n\n3. **Cross-Verify with Dog10K Database**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Dog10K database (https://dog10k.kiz.ac.cn) and cross-verify the identified version with the versions listed there.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the release dates and any relevant publications to confirm the version's relevance in May 2020.\n\n4. **Identify and Verify Files**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the specific version is confirmed, navigate to the download page on the authoritative database (Ensembl or another reliable source) to find the link to the relevant files.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the file formats and download links.\n\n5. **Summarize and Respond**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the version of the dog genome, the release date, and the direct link to the files.\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the information into a clear and concise response to the original request.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Web Search for Reliable Sources**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query 'most relevant version of dog genome in May 2020 alternative sources'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the specific version of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020, along with its release date and the direct link to the files.\n\n2. **Visit Ensembl Database**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Ensembl database (https://www.ensembl.org/Canis_lupus_familiaris/Info/Index).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check the release dates and download links for the identified version.\n\n3. **Cross-Verify with Dog10K Database**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Dog10K database (https://dog10k.kiz.ac.cn).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-verify the identified version with the versions listed there.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the release dates and any relevant publications to confirm the version's relevance in May 2020.\n\n4. **Identify and Verify Files**:\n   -

Incorporating 20 × data from 1987 individuals, including 1611 dogs (321 breeds), 309 village dogs, 63 wolves, and four coyotes, we identify genomic variation across the canid family, setting the stage for detailed studies of domestication, behavior, morphology, disease susceptibility, and genome architecture and function. \n Results:  We report the analysis of > 48 M single-nucleotide, indel, and structural variants spanning the autosomes, X chromosome, and mitochondria. We discover more than 75% of variation for 239 sampled breeds. Allele sharing analysis indicates that 94.9% of breeds form monophyletic clusters and 25 major clades. German Shepherd Dogs and related breeds show the highest allele sharing with independent breeds from multiple clades. On average, each breed dog differs from the UU_Cfam_GSD_1.0 reference at 26,960 deletions and 14,034 insertions greater than 50 bp, with wolves having 14% more variants. Discovered variants include retrogene insertions from 926 parent genes. To aid functional prioritization, single-nucleotide variants were annotated with SnpEff and Zoonomia phyloP constraint scores. Constrained positions were negatively correlated with allele frequency. Finally, the utility of the Dog10K data as an imputation reference panel is assessed, generating high-confidence calls across varied genotyping platform densities including for breeds not included in the Dog10K collection. \nFull text links\n[x]\n[x]\nCite\n Copy \nDownload .nbib\nFormat:\nSend To\nClipboard\nEmail\nSave\nMy Bibliography\nCollections\nCitation Manager\n[x]\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
