When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin. Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nTranslate the sentence 'I like apples' to Tizin language.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1.
