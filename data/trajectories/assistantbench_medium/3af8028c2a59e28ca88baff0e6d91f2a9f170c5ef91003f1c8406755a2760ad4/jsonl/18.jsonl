{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Magic: The Gathering Standard card (non-foil paper version released in its original set) that was banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns (including Oko, Crown of Thorns) had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned at the same time.\n   - We are looking for a non-foil paper version of a card released in its original set.\n   - The card must have been part of the Standard format.\n   - We need to find the card that had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact date when Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned.\n   - A list of all cards banned on that specific date.\n   - The historical price data for each of these cards, including their all-time high and all-time low prices.\n   - Sources for this information could include official Wizards of the Coast announcements, MTG Goldfish, TCGplayer, and other reputable Magic: The Gathering price tracking websites.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the price decrease for each card by subtracting the all-time low price from the all-time high price.\n   - Identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Cards that were popular or highly sought after before being banned are likely to have experienced significant price drops.\n   - Cards like Teferi, Time Raveler, Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, and Lurrus of the Dream-Den are potential candidates, as they were also powerful and influential in the Standard format around the time Oko was banned.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Ban Date**: Use WebSurfer to find the exact date when Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned.\n- **List Banned Cards**: Using the identified ban date, use WebSurfer to compile a list of all cards banned on that specific date.\n- **Gather Price Data**: For each card on the list, use WebSurfer to gather historical price data, focusing on the all-time high and all-time low prices.\n- **Calculate Price Decrease**: Use Assistant to write a Python script to calculate the price decrease for each card by subtracting the all-time low price from the all-time high price.\n- **Determine the Card with the Highest Price Decrease**: Use the Python script to identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n- **Verify and Present Results**: Use Assistant to verify the results and present the final answer."}
