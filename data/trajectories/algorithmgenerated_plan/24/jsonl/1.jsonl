The absence of this information will hinder identification of syntax or logical errors.\n2. **Debug the Code**: Identify if there are any missing dependencies, incorrect language declaration, or unsupported language features.\n3. **Optimize the Code**: Based on the findings, we will optimize any problematic areas.\n4. **Verification**: Once we have rectified the errors, I will write a test case to ensure the output is as expected.\n\nPlease provide the code snippet that is generating the exit code 1 and the message 'unknown language unknown', so I can begin the review and debugging process."}
