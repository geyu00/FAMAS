Each stanza has its own structure, and we will specifically look for those that feature indented lines.\n\n2. **Identifying indentation**: As I assess the poem, I will pay special attention to any lines that are indented compared to the rest of the lines in their respective stanzas.\n\nNow, I will examine the poem closely to find the stanza number with indented lines. \n\nUpon analyzing the poem, I have determined that stanza 2 contains indented lines. \n\nSo, the output for the stanza number with indented lines is:\n\n**2**"}
