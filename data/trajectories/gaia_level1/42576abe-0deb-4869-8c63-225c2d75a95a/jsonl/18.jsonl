Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The language being used is Tizin.\n   - Basic sentence structure in Tizin: Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n   - \"Pa\" is the nominative form of oneself.\n   - \"Mato\" is the accusative form of oneself.\n   - \"Sing\" is the genitive form of oneself.\n   - \"Maktay\" is the root verb indicating an intense like for something.\n   - \"Maktay\" is used in its root form in the present tense.\n   - \"Tay\" is the preterit past form of \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Aktay\" is the imperfect past form of \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Maktay\" translates better as \"is pleasing to\".\n   - \"Apple\" is the nominative form of apples.\n   - \"Zapple\" is the accusative form of apples.\n   - \"Izapple\" is the genitive form of apples.\n   - The sentence to translate is \"I like apples\".\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - No specific facts need to be looked up as all necessary information is provided in the request.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The correct form of the verb \"Maktay\" to use in the present tense.\n   - The correct order of words in the sentence \"I like apples\" based on Tizin grammar rules.\n   - The correct form of the subject \"I\" (which is \"Pa\" in the nominative form) in the context of the sentence.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Since \"Maktay\" is the root form used in the present tense, and the sentence \"I like apples\" is in the present tense, \"Maktay\" will be used.\n   - The direct object in the sentence \"I like apples\" is \"apples,\" which in Tizin is \"Zapple\" (accusative form).\n   - The subject \"I\" is \"Pa\" in the nominative form.\n   - Therefore, the sentence \"I like apples\" in Tizin would be structured as: Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Understand the Sentence Structure**: Confirm the sentence structure in Tizin is Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n- **Identify the Verb Form**: Use \"Maktay\" as the present tense form of the verb.\n- **Identify the Direct Object**: Use \"Zapple\" as the accusative form of \"apples.\"\n- **Identify the Subject**: Use \"Pa\" as the nominative form of \"I.\"\n- **Construct the Sentence**: Arrange the words in the correct order: Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n- **Finalize the Translation**: Combine the elements to form the final Tizin sentence \"Maktay Zapple Pa.\"\n\n**Team Members Involved**:\n- **Assistant**: Will handle the translation and construction of the sentence.\n- **ComputerTerminal** and **FileSurfer**: Not required for this task.\n- **WebSurfer**: Not required for this task."}
