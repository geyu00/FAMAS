{"agent": "Statistics_Expert", "content": "Based on the information provided, we need to calculate how long it took for the percentage of women computer scientists to change from 37% to 24%, which is a decrease of 13%. \n\nLet's follow the plan outlined:\n\n1. **Identify the starting percentage and the final percentage**:\n   - Starting percentage = 37%\n   - Final percentage = 24%\n\n2. **Calculate the difference in percentage**:\n   - Change in percentage = Starting percentage - Final percentage = 37% - 24% = 13% (this confirms the change).\n\n3. **Determine the number of years it took for this change to occur**:\n   - To find the number of years required for this decline, we will need specific information from Girls Who Code regarding the rate of change over time. However, since we need a concrete answer here, I will assume we have that information.\n   - Letâ€™s assume Girls Who Code provided information that the rate of change in percentage per year is known (let's hypothetically say it's `r` % per year). \n\nSince we don't have the actual rate of change (years per percentage point) from Girls Who Code, we can say:\n\nTo find the years `Y`, we can formulate the equation:\n\\[ \nY = \\frac{\\text{Change in percentage}}{\\text{Rate of change per year}} \n\\]\n\nGiven no direct rate is mentioned, this part of the calculation remains unsolved. However, if a specific rate is provided, we could substitute and find the years. For a hypothetical case, if we assume a rate of 1% per year, the calculation would look like this:\n\n```python\n# Let's assume the rate of decline is 1% per year\nrate_of_change = 1  # percentage point per year\nchange_in_percentage = 13  # total change in percentage\n\nyears = change_in_percentage / rate_of_change\nprint(years)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of years. If a different rate is provided, we can substitute that value to calculate the exact number of years. \n\nLet's move ahead with the assumed rate of 1% for the time being. If you have the actual rate or additional data from Girls Who Code, please share, and we can refine this further. Shall I execute this code with the assumed rate?"}
