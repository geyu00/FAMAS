Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must feature Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home).\n   - The film's rating on IMDb must be considered.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The IMDb ratings for each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has a significant filmography, and it is likely that several of her films meet the runtime requirement.\n   - Some of her more critically acclaimed films, such as \"The Story of Adele H.\" or \"Camille Claudel,\" might be highly rated on IMDb.\n   - Given the transition from Vudu to Fandango at Home, the availability of films might have changed, but many popular titles are likely still available.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify Isabelle Adjani's Feature Films**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for a comprehensive list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on a reliable source like IMDb or her official filmography page.\n\n- **Step 2: Filter by Runtime**\n  - Use WebSurfer to gather the runtime information for each film listed in Step 1.\n\n- **Step 3: Check IMDb Ratings**\n  - Use WebSurfer to find the IMDb ratings for each film that meets the runtime criteria.\n\n- **Step 4: Check Availability on Fandango at Home**\n  - Use WebSurfer to check the availability of the filtered films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n- **Step 5: Determine the Highest-Rated Film**\n  - Analyze the data collected in Steps 2-4 to identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n- **Step 6: Verify and Provide the Answer**\n  - Double-check the final selection to ensure accuracy and provide the requested information."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must feature Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home).\n   - The film's rating on IMDb must be considered.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The IMDb ratings for each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has a significant filmography, and it is likely that several of her films meet the runtime requirement.\n   - Some of her more critically acclaimed films, such as \"The Story of Adele H.\" or \"Camille Claudel,\" might be highly rated on IMDb.\n   - Given the transition from Vudu to Fandango at Home, the availability of films might have changed, but many popular titles are likely still available.\n   - **New Guess**: Based on the high IMDb ratings and critical acclaim, \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) and \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) are strong candidates for being among the highest-rated films featuring Isabelle Adjani. These films are also likely to be available on major streaming platforms due to their popularity and historical significance.\n   - **New Guess**: \"Possession\" (1981) is another highly-rated film with Isabelle Adjani and is known for its unique and impactful storytelling, making it a potential candidate for high ratings and availability.\n\n### Explanation for New Guesses:\n- **\"Camille Claudel\" (1988)** and **\"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975)**: Both films are critically acclaimed and feature strong performances by Isabelle Adjani. They are often cited as some of her best work, which increases the likelihood that they have high IMDb ratings and are available on major streaming platforms.\n- **\"Possession\" (1981)**: This film is known for its unique and intense narrative, and Isabelle Adjani's performance is highly regarded. Its cult status and critical acclaim suggest it could be well-rated and available on platforms like Fandango at Home.\n\nThese guesses are based on the historical significance and critical reception of these films, which often correlate with higher IMDb ratings and better availability on streaming platforms.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect URL**: The URL `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110378/` corresponds to the TV movie \"Long Shadows\" (1994), which does not feature Isabelle Adjani. This led to a misdirection in the search process.\n2. **Lack of Specificity**: The search queries were not specific enough to directly lead to Isabelle Adjani's filmography, causing the web surfer to navigate to unrelated pages.\n3. **Inefficient Navigation**: The web surfer did not systematically gather the required information (runtimes, IMDb ratings, and availability) for each film in Isabelle Adjani's filmography.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb page: `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/`.\n\n2. **Scroll Down to Gather Filmography**:\n   - Scroll down the page to gather the list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films, including their IMDb ratings and years of release.\n\n3. **Visit Each Film's IMDb Page**:\n   - For each film, click on the film's title to navigate to its IMDb page.\n   - On each film's page, gather the runtime and IMDb rating.\n\n4. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to search for each film on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) to check availability.\n   - Note whether the film is available to buy or rent.\n\n5. **Filter and Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - Filter the films to include only those with a runtime of less than 2 hours and available on Fandango at Home.\n   - Identify the highest-rated film among the filtered list.\n\n6. **Verify and Provide the Answer**:\n   - Double-check the final selection to ensure accuracy and provide the requested information.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb Page**\n  - Open the web browser and go to `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/`.\n\n- **Step 2: Scroll Down to Gather Filmography**\n  - Scroll down the page to collect the list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films, including their IMDb ratings and years of release.\n\n- **Step 3: Visit Each Film's IMDb Page**\n  - For each film, click on the film's title to navigate to its IMDb page.\n  - On each film's page, gather the runtime and IMDb rating.\n\n- **Step 4: Check Availability on Fandango at Home**\n  - Search for each film on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) to check availability.\n  - Note whether the film is available to buy or rent.\n\n- **Step 5: Filter and Identify the Highest-Rated Film**\n  - Filter the films to include only those with a runtime of less than 2 hours and available on Fandango at Home.\n  - Identify the highest-rated film among the filtered list.\n\n- **Step 6: Verify and Provide the Answer**\n  - Double-check the final selection to ensure accuracy and provide the requested information.\n\nBy following this new plan, we can avoid the previous issues and systematically gather the required information to answer the question accurately."}

In most of his works there is at least a touch of ironic drollness but this film is basically serious-minded all the way through with devastating results.\\n\\n&quot;Haunting&quot; is the best way to describe Adjani&apos;s work in this, one of her first film appearances.  Her best moments are wordless; in her eyes is the essense of spiritual dissipation and emotional emaciation.  Before our eyes, she is devoured by love, and not in the conventional sense.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must feature Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home).\n   - The film's rating on IMDb must be considered.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The IMDb ratings for each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has a significant filmography, and it is likely that several of her films meet the runtime requirement.\n   - Some of her more critically acclaimed films, such as \"The Story of Adele H.\" or \"Camille Claudel,\" might be highly rated on IMDb.\n   - Given the transition from Vudu to Fandango at Home, the availability of films might have changed, but many popular titles are likely still available.\n   - **New Guess**: Based on the high IMDb ratings and critical acclaim, \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) and \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) are strong candidates for being among the highest-rated films featuring Isabelle Adjani. These films are also likely to be available on major streaming platforms due to their popularity and historical significance.\n   - **New Guess**: \"Possession\" (1981) is another highly-rated film with Isabelle Adjani and is known for its unique and impactful storytelling, making it a potential candidate for high ratings and availability.\n   - **Updated Guess**: \"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht\" (1979) is also a highly-rated film featuring Isabelle Adjani. Given its classic status and popularity, it is likely to be available on major streaming platforms.\n\n### Explanation for New Guesses:\n- **\"Camille Claudel\" (1988)** and **\"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975)**: Both films are critically acclaimed and feature strong performances by Isabelle Adjani. They are often cited as some of her best work, which increases the likelihood that they have high IMDb ratings and are available on major streaming platforms.\n- **\"Possession\" (1981)**: This film is known for its unique and intense narrative, and Isabelle Adjani's performance is highly regarded. Its cult status and critical acclaim suggest it could be well-rated and available on platforms like Fandango at Home.\n- **\"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht\" (1979)**: This film is a classic and features Isabelle Adjani in a notable role. Given its historical significance and popularity, it is likely to be available on major streaming platforms and have a high IMDb rating.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Navigate to Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu)** and search for the following films:\n   - \"L'histoire d'Adèle H.\" (1975)\n   - \"Camille Claudel\" (1988)\n   - \"Possession\" (1981)\n   - \"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht\" (1979)\n\n2. **Check the availability** of these films to buy or rent on Fandango at Home.\n\n3. **Note the runtimes** and IMDb ratings for each film.\n\n4. **Identify the highest-rated film** that meets all the criteria (Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to gather the required information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Search Queries**: The search queries used to find the films on Fandango at Home were too broad and did not directly lead to the specific pages for the films.\n2. **Lack of Direct Navigation**: Instead of navigating directly to the Fandango at Home site and searching for the films, the search was conducted via a search engine, which led to indirect and less relevant results.\n3. **Insufficient Verification**: The runtimes and availability of the films were not systematically verified, leading to incomplete information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to Fandango at Home**:\n   - Open the web browser and go to `https://www.fandango.com/fandango-at-home`.\n\n2. **Search for Each Film Individually**:\n   - For each film, use the search bar on Fandango at Home to search for:\n     - \"L'histoire d'Adèle H. (1975)\"\n     - \"Camille Claudel (1988)\"\n     - \"Possession (1981)\"\n     - \"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht (1979)\"\n\n3. **Verify Availability and Runtime**:\n   - For each film, check if it is available to buy or rent.\n   - Note the runtime of each film.\n\n4. **Check IMDb Ratings**:\n   - For each film, navigate to its IMDb page to confirm the IMDb rating.\n\n5. **Filter and Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - Filter the films to include only those with a runtime of less than 2 hours and available on Fandango at Home.\n   - Identify the highest-rated film among the filtered list.\n\n6. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Double-check the final selection to ensure accuracy and provide the requested information.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to Fandango at Home**\n  - Open the web browser and go to `https://www.fandango.com/fandango-at-home`.\n\n- **Step 2: Search for Each Film Individually**\n  - Search for \"L'histoire d'Adèle H. (1975)\".\n  - Search for \"Camille Claudel (1988)\".\n  - Search for \"Possession (1981)\".\n  - Search for \"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht (1979)\".\n\n- **Step 3: Verify Availability and Runtime**\n  - For each film, check if it is available to buy or rent.\n  - Note the runtime of each film.\n\n- **Step 4: Check IMDb Ratings**\n  - For each film, navigate to its IMDb page to confirm the IMDb rating.\n\n- **Step 5: Filter and Identify the Highest-Rated Film**\n  - Filter the films to include only those with a runtime of less than 2 hours and available on Fandango at Home.\n  - Identify the highest-rated film among the filtered list.\n\n- **Step 6: Provide the Final Answer**\n  - Double-check the final selection to ensure accuracy and provide the requested information.\n\nBy following this new plan, we can avoid the previous issues and systematically gather the required information to answer the question accurately."}
