{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich restaurants (not takeaway only) within 1 blocks of Washington Square Park have vegan mains for under $15?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n   - The type of establishment is a restaurant (not takeaway only).\n   - The menu must include vegan mains.\n   - The price range for vegan mains is under $15.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific restaurant names within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n   - Menu items and prices for these restaurants.\n   - Availability of vegan mains at these restaurants.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Google Maps for restaurant locations, restaurant websites or online menus for menu items and prices, and possibly Yelp or other review sites for additional details on vegan options.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether the restaurants meet all the criteria (location, type, vegan mains, price).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely several restaurants around Washington Square Park, but not all may offer vegan mains.\n   - Some popular chain restaurants or cafes might have vegan options, but it's uncertain if they will meet the price requirement.\n   - Independent, local eateries might be more likely to offer affordable vegan mains.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to search for restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n  - **Action**: Perform a web search using terms like \"restaurants near Washington Square Park\" and filter results to those within 1 block.\n  \n- **Step 2**: Identify the names and websites of the restaurants found.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to visit each restaurant’s website or relevant pages (e.g., Google Maps, Yelp) to gather this information.\n  \n- **Step 3**: Check if the identified restaurants are not takeaway only.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to verify if the restaurants have dine-in options by checking their websites or reviews.\n  \n- **Step 4**: Verify if the restaurants offer vegan mains.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to check the menu of each restaurant for vegan options.\n  \n- **Step 5**: Determine the prices of the vegan mains.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to find the prices of the vegan mains on the menu.\n  \n- **Step 6**: Filter the results to include only those restaurants with vegan mains under $15.\n  - **Action**: Assistant to compile the final list based on the gathered information.\n  \n- **Step 7**: Present the final list of restaurants that meet all criteria.\n  - **Action**: Assistant to format and provide the final answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich restaurants (not takeaway only) within 1 blocks of Washington Square Park have vegan mains for under $15?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress we've made so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n   - The type of establishment is a restaurant (not takeaway only).\n   - The menu must include vegan mains.\n   - The price range for vegan mains is under $15.\n   - Some notable restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park include:\n     - Babbo (Italian, $$)\n     - Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ (Barbecue, Japanese, $$)\n     - BONDST (Japanese, Seafood, $$)\n     - Rosemary's (Italian, Bar, $)\n     - Monte's Trattoria (Italian, $$)\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific menu items and prices for Babbo, Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ, BONDST, Rosemary's, and Monte's Trattoria.\n   - Availability of vegan mains at these restaurants.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Restaurant websites or online menus for menu items and prices, and possibly Yelp or other review sites for additional details on vegan options.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether the restaurants meet all the criteria (location, type, vegan mains, price).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are several restaurants around Washington Square Park, but not all may offer vegan mains.\n   - Some popular chain restaurants or cafes might have vegan options, but it's uncertain if they will meet the price requirement.\n   - Independent, local eateries might be more likely to offer affordable vegan mains.\n   - Given the popularity and variety of restaurants in the area, it is likely that at least one of the listed restaurants will have vegan mains under $15.\n   - Italian restaurants like Babbo and Monte's Trattoria might have more vegan options due to the prevalence of vegetable-based dishes in Italian cuisine.\n   - Japanese restaurants like Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ and BONDST might have fewer vegan options, but they often offer vegetable-based dishes that could be suitable.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Visit the websites of Babbo, Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ, BONDST, Rosemary's, and Monte's Trattoria to check their menus and prices.\n- Verify if these restaurants offer vegan mains and if they are under $15.\n- Confirm that these restaurants are not takeaway only and offer dine-in options.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Repetition of Actions**: The WebSurfer repeatedly clicked on the same \"Website\" link without progressing to the next steps or verifying the necessary information.\n- **Lack of Clear Instructions**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were not specific enough to guide the actions needed to check the menus and prices of the restaurants.\n- **Inefficient Use of Resources**: The WebSurfer did not effectively use the information gathered to move forward with the task.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Step 1**: Perform a web search for restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to search for \"restaurants near Washington Square Park\" and filter results to those within 1 block.\n  \n- **Step 2**: Identify the names and websites of the restaurants found.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to visit each restaurant’s website or relevant pages (e.g., Google Maps, Yelp) to gather this information.\n  \n- **Step 3**: Verify if the identified restaurants are not takeaway only.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to check the restaurant’s website or reviews for dine-in options.\n  \n- **Step 4**: Check if the identified restaurants offer vegan mains.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to visit the menu of each restaurant and look for vegan options.\n  \n- **Step 5**: Determine the prices of the vegan mains.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to find the prices of the vegan mains on the menu.\n  \n- **Step 6**: Filter the results to include only those restaurants with vegan mains under $15.\n  - **Action**: Assistant to compile the final list based on the gathered information.\n  \n- **Step 7**: Present the final list of restaurants that meet all criteria.\n  - **Action**: Assistant to format and provide the final answer.\n\n### Detailed Instructions for WebSurfer:\n1. **Perform the Initial Search**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to search for \"restaurants near Washington Square Park\" and filter results to those within 1 block.\n   - **Hint**: Use Google Maps or a similar service to ensure the restaurants are within 1 block.\n\n2. **Identify Restaurant Names and Websites**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to visit each restaurant’s website or relevant pages (e.g., Google Maps, Yelp) to gather the names and websites of the restaurants.\n   - **Hint**: Look for the \"Website\" link on Google Maps or Yelp entries.\n\n3. **Verify Dine-In Options**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to check the restaurant’s website or reviews for dine-in options.\n   - **Hint**: Look for phrases like \"dine-in,\" \"sit-down,\" or \"restaurant\" to confirm it is not takeaway only.\n\n4. **Check for Vegan Mains**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to visit the menu of each restaurant and look for vegan options.\n   - **Hint**: Use the search function on the website to look for \"vegan\" or \"vegetarian\" options.\n\n5. **Determine Prices of Vegan Mains**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to find the prices of the vegan mains on the menu.\n   - **Hint**: Look for the prices listed next to the vegan dishes.\n\n6. **Compile and Filter Results**:\n   - **Action**: Assistant to compile the final list of restaurants that offer vegan mains under $15.\n   - **Hint**: Ensure all criteria are met (location, type, vegan mains, price).\n\n7. **Present the Final List**:\n   - **Action**: Assistant to format and provide the final answer.\n   - **Hint**: Include the restaurant name, address, and a brief description of the vegan mains and their prices."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich restaurants (not takeaway only) within 1 blocks of Washington Square Park have vegan mains for under $15?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress we've made so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n   - The type of establishment is a restaurant (not takeaway only).\n   - The menu must include vegan mains.\n   - The price range for vegan mains is under $15.\n   - Some notable restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park include:\n     - Babbo (Italian, $$)\n     - Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ (Barbecue, Japanese, $$)\n     - BONDST (Japanese, Seafood, $$)\n     - Rosemary's (Italian, Bar, $)\n     - Monte's Trattoria (Italian, $$)\n   - Rosemary's is confirmed to offer dine-in options and has a menu that includes vegan mains, though specific prices are still being verified.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific menu items and prices for Babbo, Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ, BONDST, Rosemary's, and Monte's Trattoria.\n   - Availability of vegan mains at these restaurants.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Restaurant websites or online menus for menu items and prices, and possibly Yelp or other review sites for additional details on vegan options.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether the restaurants meet all the criteria (location, type, vegan mains, price).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are several restaurants around Washington Square Park, but not all may offer vegan mains.\n   - Some popular chain restaurants or cafes might have vegan options, but it's uncertain if they will meet the price requirement.\n   - Independent, local eateries might be more likely to offer affordable vegan mains.\n   - Given the popularity and variety of restaurants in the area, it is likely that at least one of the listed restaurants will have vegan mains under $15.\n   - Italian restaurants like Babbo and Monte's Trattoria might have more vegan options due to the prevalence of vegetable-based dishes in Italian cuisine.\n   - Japanese restaurants like Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ and BONDST might have fewer vegan options, but they often offer vegetable-based dishes that could be suitable.\n   - Rosemary's is likely to have vegan mains under $15, given its mid-range pricing and focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Visit the websites of Babbo, Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ, BONDST, and Monte's Trattoria to check their menus and prices.\n- Verify if these restaurants offer vegan mains and if they are under $15.\n- Confirm that these restaurants are not takeaway only and offer dine-in options.\n- Continue to gather detailed information about Rosemary's, including specific vegan mains and their prices.\n\n### Additional Hunch:\n- **Reasoning for Focusing on Rosemary's**: Since Rosemary's is already confirmed to offer dine-in options and has a menu that includes vegan mains, it is a strong candidate for meeting all the criteria. The mid-range pricing ($$) suggests that there is a good chance some vegan mains will fall under $15. Therefore, it is worth prioritizing the verification of Rosemary's menu and prices.\n\nPlease proceed to gather detailed information about Rosemary's, starting with their menu and prices for vegan mains. If Rosemary's meets all the criteria, we can then move on to the other restaurants.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Repetition of Actions**: The WebSurfer repeatedly attempted to visit the same pages without progressing to the next steps or verifying the necessary information.\n- **Lack of Clear Instructions**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were not specific enough to guide the actions needed to check the menus and prices of the restaurants.\n- **Inefficient Use of Resources**: The WebSurfer did not effectively use the information gathered to move forward with the task, leading to repeated errors and dead ends.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Step 1**: Perform a web search for \"restaurants near Washington Square Park within 1 block\" to gather a list of restaurants.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to search for \"restaurants near Washington Square Park within 1 block\" and filter results to those within 1 block.\n  - **Hint**: Use Google Maps or a similar service to ensure the restaurants are within 1 block.\n\n- **Step 2**: Identify the names and websites of the restaurants found.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to visit each restaurant’s website or relevant pages (e.g., Google Maps, Yelp) to gather the names and websites of the restaurants.\n  - **Hint**: Look for the \"Website\" link on Google Maps or Yelp entries.\n\n- **Step 3**: Verify if the identified restaurants offer dine-in options.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to check the restaurant’s website or reviews for dine-in options.\n  - **Hint**: Look for phrases like \"dine-in,\" \"sit-down,\" or \"restaurant\" to confirm it is not takeaway only.\n\n- **Step 4**: Check if the identified restaurants offer vegan mains.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to visit the menu of each restaurant and look for vegan options.\n  - **Hint**: Use the search function on the website to look for \"vegan\" or \"vegetarian\" options.\n\n- **Step 5**: Determine the prices of the vegan mains.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to find the prices of the vegan mains on the menu.\n  - **Hint**: Look for the prices listed next to the vegan dishes.\n\n- **Step 6**: Filter the results to include only those restaurants with vegan mains under $15.\n  - **Action**: Assistant to compile the final list based on the gathered information.\n  - **Hint**: Ensure all criteria are met (location, type, vegan mains, price).\n\n- **Step 7**: Present the final list of restaurants that meet all criteria.\n  - **Action**: Assistant to format and provide the final answer.\n  - **Hint**: Include the restaurant name, address, and a brief description of the vegan mains and their prices.\n\n### Detailed Instructions for WebSurfer:\n1. **Perform the Initial Search**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to search for \"restaurants near Washington Square Park within 1 block\" and filter results to those within 1 block.\n   - **Hint**: Use Google Maps or a similar service to ensure the restaurants are within 1 block.\n\n2. **Identify Restaurant Names and Websites**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to visit each restaurant’s website or relevant pages (e.g., Google Maps, Yelp) to gather the names and websites of the restaurants.\n   - **Hint**: Look for the \"Website\" link on Google Maps or Yelp entries.\n\n3. **Verify Dine-In Options**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to check the restaurant’s website or reviews for dine-in options.\n   - **Hint**: Look for phrases like \"dine-in,\" \"sit-down,\" or \"restaurant\" to confirm it is not takeaway only.\n\n4. **Check for Vegan Mains**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to visit the menu of each restaurant and look for vegan options.\n   - **Hint**: Use the search function on the website to look for \"vegan\" or \"vegetarian\" options.\n\n5. **Determine Prices of Vegan Mains**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to find the prices of the vegan mains on the menu.\n   - **Hint**: Look for the prices listed next to the vegan dishes.\n\n6. **Compile and Filter Results**:\n   - **Action**: Assistant to compile the final list of restaurants that offer vegan mains under $15.\n   - **Hint**: Ensure all criteria are met (location, type, vegan mains, price).\n\n7. **Present the Final List**:\n   - **Action**: Assistant to format and provide the final answer.\n   - **Hint**: Include the restaurant name, address, and a brief description of the vegan mains and their prices.\n\n### Additional Hints:\n- **Use Multiple Sources**: If the restaurant's official website is not accessible, use Yelp, Google Maps, or other review sites to gather the necessary information.\n- **Be Thorough**: Ensure that each step is completed before moving on to the next. Double-check the information to avoid missing any details.\n- **Avoid Dead Ends**: If a page does not load or provides insufficient information, move on to the next restaurant and return to the problematic one later."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich restaurants (not takeaway only) within 1 blocks of Washington Square Park have vegan mains for under $15?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress we've made so far:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n   - The type of establishment is a restaurant (not takeaway only).\n   - The menu must include vegan mains.\n   - The price range for vegan mains is under $15.\n   - Notable restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park include:\n     - Babbo (Italian, $$)\n     - Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ (Barbecue, Japanese, $$)\n     - BONDST (Japanese, Seafood, $$)\n     - Rosemary's (Italian, Bar, $)\n     - Monte's Trattoria (Italian, $$)\n   - Rosemary's is confirmed to offer dine-in options and has a menu that includes vegan mains, though specific prices are still being verified.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific menu items and prices for Babbo, Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ, BONDST, Rosemary's, and Monte's Trattoria.\n   - Availability of vegan mains at these restaurants.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Restaurant websites or online menus for menu items and prices, and possibly Yelp or other review sites for additional details on vegan options.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether the restaurants meet all the criteria (location, type, vegan mains, price).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are several restaurants around Washington Square Park, but not all may offer vegan mains.\n   - Some popular chain restaurants or cafes might have vegan options, but it's uncertain if they will meet the price requirement.\n   - Independent, local eateries might be more likely to offer affordable vegan mains.\n   - Given the popularity and variety of restaurants in the area, it is likely that at least one of the listed restaurants will have vegan mains under $15.\n   - Italian restaurants like Babbo and Monte's Trattoria might have more vegan options due to the prevalence of vegetable-based dishes in Italian cuisine.\n   - Japanese restaurants like Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ and BONDST might have fewer vegan options, but they often offer vegetable-based dishes that could be suitable.\n   - Rosemary's is likely to have vegan mains under $15, given its mid-range pricing and focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients.\n\n### Additional Hunch:\n- **Reasoning for Focusing on Rosemary's**: Since Rosemary's is already confirmed to offer dine-in options and has a menu that includes vegan mains, it is a strong candidate for meeting all the criteria. The mid-range pricing ($$) suggests that there is a good chance some vegan mains will fall under $15. Therefore, it is worth prioritizing the verification of Rosemary's menu and prices.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Rosemary's**:\n  - Navigate to the dinner menu section of Rosemary's website.\n  - Identify the vegan mains and note their prices.\n  - Confirm if any of the vegan mains are under $15.\n- **Other Restaurants**:\n  - Visit the websites of Babbo, Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ, BONDST, and Monte's Trattoria to check their menus and prices.\n  - Verify if these restaurants offer vegan mains and if they are under $15.\n  - Confirm that these restaurants are not takeaway only and offer dine-in options.\n\n### Action Items:\n1. **WebSurfer**:\n   - Navigate to the dinner menu section of Rosemary's website.\n   - Identify and list the vegan mains and their prices.\n   - Confirm if Rosemary's meets all the criteria (location, type, vegan mains, price).\n\n2. **Assistant**:\n   - Once the information for Rosemary's is gathered, compile the final list of restaurants that meet all the criteria.\n   - If Rosemary's meets the criteria, proceed to gather information for the other restaurants.\n\nPlease proceed to gather detailed information about Rosemary's, starting with their menu and prices for vegan mains. If Rosemary's meets all the criteria, we can then move on to the other restaurants.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Repetition of Actions**: The WebSurfer repeatedly navigated to the same sections of the website without progressing to the specific menu items and prices.\n- **Lack of Clear Instructions**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were not specific enough to guide the actions needed to check the menus and prices of the restaurants.\n- **Inefficient Use of Resources**: The WebSurfer did not effectively use the information gathered to move forward with the task, leading to repeated errors and dead ends.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Step 1**: Perform a web search for \"restaurants near Washington Square Park within 1 block\" to gather a list of restaurants.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to search for \"restaurants near Washington Square Park within 1 block\" and filter results to those within 1 block.\n  - **Hint**: Use Google Maps or a similar service to ensure the restaurants are within 1 block.\n\n- **Step 2**: Identify the names and websites of the restaurants found.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to visit each restaurant’s website or relevant pages (e.g., Google Maps, Yelp) to gather the names and websites of the restaurants.\n  - **Hint**: Look for the \"Website\" link on Google Maps or Yelp entries.\n\n- **Step 3**: Verify if the identified restaurants offer dine-in options.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to check the restaurant’s website or reviews for dine-in options.\n  - **Hint**: Look for phrases like \"dine-in,\" \"sit-down,\" or \"restaurant\" to confirm it is not takeaway only.\n\n- **Step 4**: Check if the identified restaurants offer vegan mains.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to visit the menu of each restaurant and look for vegan options.\n  - **Hint**: Use the search function on the website to look for \"vegan\" or \"vegetarian\" options.\n\n- **Step 5**: Determine the prices of the vegan mains.\n  - **Action**: WebSurfer to find the prices of the vegan mains on the menu.\n  - **Hint**: Look for the prices listed next to the vegan dishes.\n\n- **Step 6**: Filter the results to include only those restaurants with vegan mains under $15.\n  - **Action**: Assistant to compile the final list based on the gathered information.\n  - **Hint**: Ensure all criteria are met (location, type, vegan mains, price).\n\n- **Step 7**: Present the final list of restaurants that meet all criteria.\n  - **Action**: Assistant to format and provide the final answer.\n  - **Hint**: Include the restaurant name, address, and a brief description of the vegan mains and their prices.\n\n### Detailed Instructions for WebSurfer:\n1. **Perform the Initial Search**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to search for \"restaurants near Washington Square Park within 1 block\" and filter results to those within 1 block.\n   - **Hint**: Use Google Maps or a similar service to ensure the restaurants are within 1 block.\n\n2. **Identify Restaurant Names and Websites**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to visit each restaurant’s website or relevant pages (e.g., Google Maps, Yelp) to gather the names and websites of the restaurants.\n   - **Hint**: Look for the \"Website\" link on Google Maps or Yelp entries.\n\n3. **Verify Dine-In Options**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to check the restaurant’s website or reviews for dine-in options.\n   - **Hint**: Look for phrases like \"dine-in,\" \"sit-down,\" or \"restaurant\" to confirm it is not takeaway only.\n\n4. **Check for Vegan Mains**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to visit the menu of each restaurant and look for vegan options.\n   - **Hint**: Use the search function on the website to look for \"vegan\" or \"vegetarian\" options.\n\n5. **Determine Prices of Vegan Mains**:\n   - **Action**: WebSurfer to find the prices of the vegan mains on the menu.\n   - **Hint**: Look for the prices listed next to the vegan dishes.\n\n6. **Compile and Filter Results**:\n   - **Action**: Assistant to compile the final list of restaurants that offer vegan mains under $15.\n   - **Hint**: Ensure all criteria are met (location, type, vegan mains, price).\n\n7. **Present the Final List**:\n   - **Action**: Assistant to format and provide the final answer.\n   - **Hint**: Include the restaurant name, address, and a brief description of the vegan mains and their prices.\n\n### Additional Hints:\n- **Use Multiple Sources**: If the restaurant's official website is not accessible, use Yelp, Google Maps, or other review sites to gather the necessary information.\n- **Be Thorough**: Ensure that each step is completed before moving on to the next. Double-check the information to avoid missing any details.\n- **Avoid Dead Ends**: If a page does not load or provides insufficient information, move on to the next restaurant and return to the problematic one later.\n\n### Start with Rosemary's:\n- **Action**: WebSurfer to visit the dinner menu section of Rosemary's website.\n- **Hint**: Navigate to the \"Dinner\" section and identify the vegan mains and their prices. Confirm if Rosemary's meets all the criteria (location, type, vegan mains, price)."}
