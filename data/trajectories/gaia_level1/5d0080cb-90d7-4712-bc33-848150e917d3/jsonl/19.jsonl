Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The paper in question is titled \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet.\"\n   - The paper was published by the University of Leicester.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific volume in m³ of the fish bag as reported in the University of Leicester paper \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet.\"\n   - The publication date of the paper.\n   - The authors of the paper.\n   - Any additional details about the methodology used to calculate the volume of the fish bag.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - If the exact volume is not directly stated, it may need to be derived from other data provided in the paper, such as the number of fish, the average size of the fish, and the dimensions of the bag.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the context of the paper, which involves a fictional scenario from the \"How to Train Your Dragon\" series, the volume of the fish bag is likely to be an estimate rather than a precise measurement.\n   - Given the scale of dragons in the series, the volume of the fish bag might be reasonably large, possibly in the range of several cubic meters, but this is speculative without the actual data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for the University of Leicester paper titled \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet\" to find the specific volume in m³ of the fish bag.\n- **WebSurfer**: If the paper is found, read and extract the relevant information about the volume of the fish bag.\n- **WebSurfer**: If the paper is not directly available, search for summaries or articles that reference the paper and provide the required information.\n- **Assistant**: Verify the extracted information and ensure it is accurate and complete.\n- **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the volume in m³ of the fish bag, and any additional relevant details from the paper."}
