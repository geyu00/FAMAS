Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is looking for a GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n   - The date specified is 20/10/2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The specific location or database where such a file would be stored (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl, or a specialized marine biology database).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None identified at this stage.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file for beluga whales is likely to be hosted on a scientific database such as NCBI or Ensembl, which are common repositories for genomic data.\n   - The file may be part of a larger dataset or project related to marine mammal genomics.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Source**: Determine the most likely source for the GFF3 file for beluga whales, such as NCBI, Ensembl, or a specialized marine biology database.\n- **Web Search**: Use WebSurfer to search for the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020.\n- **Locate the File**: Once the relevant database or website is identified, use WebSurfer to navigate to the specific page containing the GFF3 file.\n- **Extract the Link**: Have WebSurfer extract the direct link to the GFF3 file.\n- **Verify the Date**: Ensure that the file is indeed the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n- **Report the Link**: Provide the direct link to the GFF3 file."}

We maintain the Ensembl Archive sites so that there are stable links to data from a particular release. As of December 2016 these will be available for \nfive years, together with the following longer term archives: \nAnnotation on the \nhuman NCBI36 assembly is available at our \nEnsembl 54 archive site.\nAnnotation on the \nmouse NCBIm37 assembly is available at our \nEnsembl 67 archive site.\nAs from August 2014 we are supporting the \nhuman GRCh37 assembly at our dedicated \nGRCh37 human site. Unlike the other Ensembl archive sites, this will be updated to the latest web interface every Ensembl release and there may be occasional data updates to human.\n Archived databases are also maintained for at least 10 years. More information is available from our \nMySQL database documentation. We also maintain data archives from 2004 available from our \nFTP site. \nFor all enquiries, please \ncontact the Ensembl HelpDesk.\nNotes\nEnsembl aims to maintain stable identifiers for genes (ENSG), transcripts (ENST), proteins (ENSP) and exons (ENSE) as long as possible. Changes within the genome sequence assembly or an updated genome annotation may dramatically change a gene model. In these cases, the old set of stable IDs is retired and a new one assigned. Gene and transcript pages both have an ID History view which maps changes in the ID from the earliest version in Ensembl.\nProtein family identifiers (fam), Ensembl EST gene identifiers (ENSESTG) and Genscan identifiers (GENSCAN) are currently not stable.\nWith the exception of the GRCh37 human site \nBLAST, BLAT and other tools are not available from the archive sites.\nAccounts are shared between the current site and almost all archives.

The exceptions are the older human NCBI36 and the mouse GRCm37 sites where changes in architecture and code make sharing logins impractical. \nLinking to the Archive Ensembl sites\nThe Archive Ensembl sites have the format: \nhttp://<three-letter-month><year>.archive.ensembl.org for example \nhttp://nov2008.archive.ensembl.org)\nIn the footer of each current Ensembl page, there is a link called 'Permanent link', which links to the corresponding page in the Ensembl Archive. A similar link on each archive page links back to the current site (i.e. www.ensembl.org).\nFor example if you are looking at the Alternative Splicing view for human gene BRCA2 on the \nmain Ensembl site in August 2015, when Ensembl 80 was the current version, the URL would be:\nhttp://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Splice?db=core;g=ENSG00000139618;r=13:31787617-31871809;t=ENST00000380152and the equivalent archived page URL would be:\nhttp://jul2015.archive.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Splice?db=core;g=ENSG00000139618;r=13:31787617-31871809;t=ENST00000380152This website requires cookies, and the limited processing of your personal data in order to function.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the link to the GFF3 file for beluga whales that was the most recent one on 20/10/2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is looking for a GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n   - The date specified is 20/10/2020.\n   - Ensembl maintains archives of its releases, and the release closest to 20/10/2020 is Ensembl 102 (November 2020).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific location within the Ensembl 102 archive where the GFF3 file for beluga whales can be found.\n   - The direct link to the GFF3 file for beluga whales in the Ensembl 102 archive.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact filename and path for the GFF3 file in the Ensembl 102 archive.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file for beluga whales is likely to be hosted on the Ensembl FTP site within the Ensembl 102 archive, given that Ensembl is a well-known repository for genomic data.\n   - The file may be located in a directory structure similar to `/pub/release-102/gff3/delphinapterus_leucas/`.\n   - The filename for the GFF3 file might follow a naming convention such as `Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.102.gff3.gz`.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Ensembl FTP Site**: Since we have confirmed that Ensembl maintains archives and the closest release to 20/10/2020 is Ensembl 102, it is reasonable to assume that the GFF3 file is available on the Ensembl FTP site for this release.\n- **Directory Structure**: Based on the typical structure of Ensembl FTP directories, the GFF3 file for beluga whales is likely to be in a directory named after the species and the release version.\n- **Filename Convention**: Ensembl often follows a consistent naming convention for its files, which includes the species name, assembly version, and release number. This helps in easily identifying the correct file.\n\nNext steps:\n- Navigate to the Ensembl 102 FTP directory for beluga whales.\n- Locate the GFF3 file and extract the direct link.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetitive Navigation**: We repeatedly navigated to the same page (Ensembl 102 archive) without actually accessing the FTP site or the specific directory for the beluga whale GFF3 file.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: We did not specify the exact steps to navigate to the FTP directory and locate the GFF3 file, leading to a lack of progress.\n- **Overlooking Direct Links**: We did not extract the direct link to the GFF3 file even when we were close to the correct page.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Ensembl 102 FTP Directory**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Ensembl 102 FTP site: `https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-102/gff3/delphinapterus_leucas/`.\n\n2. **Locate the GFF3 File**:\n   - Once on the FTP directory page, locate the GFF3 file for beluga whales. The filename is expected to be in the format `Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.102.gff3.gz`.\n\n3. **Extract the Direct Link**:\n   - Extract the direct link to the GFF3 file from the FTP directory page.\n\n4. **Verify the Date**:\n   - Ensure that the file is indeed the most recent one as of 20/10/2020 by checking the file metadata or the release notes.\n\n5. **Report the Link**:\n   - Provide the direct link to the GFF3 file.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the Ensembl 102 FTP directory.\n  - WebSurfer, please navigate to `https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-102/gff3/delphinapterus_leucas/`.\n\n- **Step 2**: Locate the GFF3 file.\n  - On the FTP directory page, find the GFF3 file for beluga whales. The expected filename is `Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.102.gff3.gz`.\n\n- **Step 3**: Extract the direct link.\n  - Extract the direct link to the GFF3 file from the FTP directory page.\n\n- **Step 4**: Verify the date.\n  - Check the file metadata or release notes to ensure the file is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n- **Step 5**: Report the link.\n  - Provide the direct link to the GFF3 file.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to successfully locate and provide the direct link to the GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020."}
