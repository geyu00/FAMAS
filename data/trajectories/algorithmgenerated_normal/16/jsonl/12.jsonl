{"agent": "Video_Analyst_Expert", "content": "To begin resolving this task, I will first search for the specific YouTube 360 VR video from March 2018 that is narrated by Andy Serkis, the voice actor known for playing Gollum in the Lord of the Rings series. \n\nI will utilize the YouTube Data API to locate the video. Hereâ€™s the plan to implement this search:\n\n1. Use the YouTube Data API to search for videos uploaded in March 2018.\n2. Filter those results for 360 VR videos.\n3. Identify the video narrated by Andy Serkis.\n\nLet's start by executing the search using the YouTube Data API. I'll prepare the Python code to facilitate this:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Define YouTube Data API key and search parameters\napi_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'  # Replace with your API Key\nsearch_url = \"https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search\"\n\n# Search parameters\nparams = {\n    'part': 'snippet',\n    'type': 'video',\n    'videoType': '360',  # Filter for 360 videos (if available)\n    'publishedAfter': '2018-03-01T00:00:00Z',\n    'publishedBefore': '2018-03-31T00:00:00Z',\n    'q': 'Andy Serkis 360 VR',  # Searching for Andy Serkis related 360 VR videos\n    'key': api_key,\n    'maxResults': 5\n}\n\nresponse = requests.get(search_url, params=params)\nvideo_data = response.json()\n\n# Print the video data to check the results\nprint(video_data)\n```\n\nI will execute this code in the Computer_terminal to gather the necessary video details."}

{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "The execution of the code to search for the YouTube 360 VR video narrated by Andy Serkis resulted in an error due to an invalid API key. To proceed with this task, we need a valid YouTube Data API key to successfully retrieve the video data.\n\nSince I don't have the capability to obtain or provide a valid API key, I suggest taking the following steps:\n\n1. **Obtain a valid YouTube Data API key**: If you have access to the YouTube Data API, please ensure you generate and use a valid API key in the code.\n\n2. **Retry the video search**: Once you have the valid API key, replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in the Python code with the actual key and run the code again in the Computer_terminal.\n\nIf you prefer, I can assist you in crafting the next steps to acquire the API key or provide further guidance on resolving this issue. Please let me know how you would like to proceed."}
{"agent": "Video_Analyst_Expert", "content": "As the Verification_Expert has pointed out, we need a valid YouTube Data API key to continue with the video search. Since I do not have the capability to generate or obtain an API key, I will outline what we can do next:\n\n1. **Obtain a valid YouTube Data API key**: If anyone in the group has access to the YouTube Data API, please generate a valid API key and share it.\n\n2. **Proceed with a manual search**: While waiting for the API key, we could also manually search for the relevant video on YouTube using specific search terms such as \"Andy Serkis 360 VR March 2018.\" This could help us potentially locate the video without using the API.\n\nPlease let me know how you would like to proceed or if you need further assistance!"}
