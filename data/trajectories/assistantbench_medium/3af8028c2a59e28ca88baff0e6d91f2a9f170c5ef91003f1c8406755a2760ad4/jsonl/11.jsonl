{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Magic: The Gathering Standard card (non-foil paper version released in its original set) that was banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns (including Oko, Crown of Thorns) had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned at the same time.\n   - We are looking for a non-foil paper card released in its original set.\n   - The card must have been part of the Standard format.\n   - We need to find the card with the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact date when Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned.\n   - A list of all cards banned on that specific date.\n   - The all-time high and all-time low prices for each of those cards.\n   - The original sets in which these cards were released.\n   - Verification that these cards were part of the Standard format at the time of their banning.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The price decrease for each card (all-time high minus all-time low).\n   - Identification of the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Cards that were banned alongside Oko, Thief of Crowns are likely to have been powerful or problematic in the Standard format.\n   - Some of these cards might have seen significant price drops due to their banning, especially if they were highly sought after before the ban.\n   - Cards like Teferi, Time Raveler or Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath could be strong candidates, given their impact on the meta.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Ban Date**: Use WebSurfer to find the exact date when Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned.\n- **List Banned Cards**: Use WebSurfer to compile a list of all cards banned on that specific date.\n- **Verify Card Details**: For each banned card, use WebSurfer to verify:\n  - Whether it is a non-foil paper card.\n  - Whether it was released in its original set.\n  - Whether it was part of the Standard format at the time of the ban.\n- **Price Data Collection**: For each verified card, use WebSurger to find the all-time high and all-time low prices.\n- **Calculate Price Decrease**: Use Assistant to calculate the price decrease for each card (all-time high minus all-time low).\n- **Determine Highest Price Decrease**: Use Assistant to identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n- **Final Verification**: Double-check the results using WebSurfer to ensure accuracy."}

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned at the same time.\n   - We are looking for a non-foil paper card released in its original set.\n   - The card must have been part of the Standard format.\n   - We need to find the card with the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n   - Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned on November 18, 2019.\n   - The following cards were banned on November 18, 2019:\n     - Oko, Thief of Crowns\n     - Once Upon a Time\n     - Veil of Summer\n     - Wrenn and Six\n     - Narset, Parter of Veils (restricted in Vintage, banned in Legacy)\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The all-time high and all-time low prices for each of the following cards:\n     - Once Upon a Time\n     - Veil of Summer\n     - Wrenn and Six\n     - Narset, Parter of Veils\n   - The original sets in which these cards were released.\n   - Verification that these cards were part of the Standard format at the time of their banning.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The price decrease for each card (all-time high minus all-time low).\n   - Identification of the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Cards that were banned alongside Oko, Thief of Crowns are likely to have been powerful or problematic in the Standard format.\n   - Some of these cards might have seen significant price drops due to their banning, especially if they were highly sought after before the ban.\n   - Given the impact of Oko, Thief of Crowns on the meta, cards like Once Upon a Time and Veil of Summer, which were also part of the same problematic decks, might have experienced significant price fluctuations.\n   - Wrenn and Six and Narset, Parter of Veils, while not as widely used in Standard, might still have seen notable price changes due to their bans and restrictions in other formats.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Once Upon a Time and Veil of Summer**: These cards were central to the problematic decks in Standard, particularly in combination with Oko, Thief of Crowns. Their banning likely led to a significant drop in demand and price.\n- **Wrenn and Six**: While primarily impactful in Legacy, its banning might have affected its Standard price, though perhaps not as dramatically as the other cards.\n- **Narset, Parter of Veils**: Being restricted in Vintage and banned in Legacy, it might have seen a price drop in Standard, but the impact might be less pronounced compared to the other cards.\n\nBy focusing on these cards and their historical price data, we can better determine which card had the highest price decrease.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Timeout Error**: The web surfer encountered a timeout error while trying to load a page, likely due to slow network conditions or the page taking too long to load.\n- **Inefficient Search Queries**: The search queries used were too broad, leading to irrelevant results or no results at all.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: The search did not target specific sources known for reliable historical price data, such as MTGGoldfish or TCGplayer.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Use Specific and Reliable Sources**: Directly search MTGGoldfish or TCGplayer for historical price data.\n- **Break Down the Search**: Search for each card individually to avoid overwhelming the search engine.\n- **Handle Timeouts**: Implement a retry mechanism to handle timeouts and ensure the page loads completely.\n- **Extract and Verify Data**: Ensure the data extracted is accurate and relevant.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Search for Historical Price Data on MTGGoldfish**:\n   - **Once Upon a Time**:\n     - WebSurfer: Search for \"Once Upon a Time historical price data MTGGoldfish\".\n     - WebSurfer: Click on the first relevant result and extract the all-time high and all-time low prices.\n   - **Veil of Summer**:\n     - WebSurfer: Search for \"Veil of Summer historical price data MTGGoldfish\".\n     - WebSurfer: Click on the first relevant result and extract the all-time high and all-time low prices.\n   - **Wrenn and Six**:\n     - WebSurfer: Search for \"Wrenn and Six historical price data MTGGoldfish\".\n     - WebSurfer: Click on the first relevant result and extract the all-time high and all-time low prices.\n   - **Narset, Parter of Veils**:\n     - WebSurfer: Search for \"Narset, Parter of Veils historical price data MTGGoldfish\".\n     - WebSurfer: Click on the first relevant result and extract the all-time high and all-time low prices.\n\n2. **Handle Timeouts**:\n   - WebSurfer: If a timeout occurs, retry the search or wait for the page to load completely.\n   - WebSurfer: Use the `sleep` function to wait for a few seconds before attempting to interact with the page.\n\n3. **Extract and Verify Data**:\n   - WebSurfer: Ensure the extracted data includes the all-time high and all-time low prices for each card.\n   - WebSurfer: Verify that the data is from the non-foil paper version released in its original set.\n\n4. **Calculate Price Decrease**:\n   - Assistant: Calculate the price decrease for each card using the formula: `all-time high - all-time low`.\n\n5. **Identify the Card with the Highest Price Decrease**:\n   - Assistant: Compare the price decreases and identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n6. **Final Verification**:\n   - WebSurfer: Double-check the results using MTGGoldfish or TCGplayer to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**: Include the card name, \"historical price data,\" and the source (MTGGoldfish or TCGplayer) in the search query.\n- **Wait for Page Load**: Use the `sleep` function to ensure the page has fully loaded before extracting data.\n- **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a simple retry mechanism to handle timeouts and ensure data is accurately extracted."}

Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned at the same time.\n   - We are looking for a non-foil paper card released in its original set.\n   - The card must have been part of the Standard format.\n   - We need to find the card with the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n   - Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned on November 18, 2019.\n   - The following cards were banned on November 18, 2019:\n     - Oko, Thief of Crowns\n     - Once Upon a Time\n     - Veil of Summer\n     - Wrenn and Six\n     - Narset, Parter of Veils (restricted in Vintage, banned in Legacy)\n   - All the mentioned cards were part of the Standard format at the time of their banning.\n   - The original sets in which these cards were released:\n     - Oko, Thief of Crowns: Throne of Eldraine (ELD)\n     - Once Upon a Time: Throne of Eldraine (ELD)\n     - Veil of Summer: Core Set 2020 (M20)\n     - Wrenn and Six: Guilds of Ravnica (GRN)\n     - Narset, Parter of Veils: Core Set 2020 (M20)\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The all-time high and all-time low prices for each of the following cards:\n     - Once Upon a Time\n     - Veil of Summer\n     - Wrenn and Six\n     - Narset, Parter of Veils\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The price decrease for each card (all-time high minus all-time low).\n   - Identification of the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Once Upon a Time and Veil of Summer**: These cards were central to the problematic decks in Standard, particularly in combination with Oko, Thief of Crowns. Their banning likely led to a significant drop in demand and price.\n   - **Wrenn and Six**: While primarily impactful in Legacy, its banning might have affected its Standard price, though perhaps not as dramatically as the other cards.\n   - **Narset, Parter of Veils**: Being restricted in Vintage and banned in Legacy, it might have seen a price drop in Standard, but the impact might be less pronounced compared to the other cards.\n   - **Impact of Banning**: Cards that were banned due to their power level in Standard, such as Once Upon a Time and Veil of Summer, are likely to have experienced more significant price drops compared to cards that were less central to the meta, like Wrenn and Six and Narset, Parter of Veils.\n   - **Data Sources**: MTGGoldfish and TCGplayer are reliable sources for historical price data. Using these sources will provide accurate and detailed information about the price history of the cards.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Once Upon a Time and Veil of Summer**: These cards were integral to the Oko, Thief of Crowns decks, which dominated the Standard format. Their banning would have significantly reduced their value, leading to substantial price drops.\n- **Wrenn and Six**: Although it saw some play in Standard, its primary impact was in Legacy. The banning might have had a moderate effect on its Standard price.\n- **Narset, Parter of Veils**: Its restriction in Vintage and banning in Legacy indicate its power level in those formats. However, in Standard, it was not as dominant, so the price drop might be less significant.\n- **Reliable Data Sources**: Using MTGGoldfish and TCGplayer ensures that we get accurate and up-to-date historical price data, which is crucial for determining the price decreases.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Historical Price Data**:\n   - WebSurfer: Search for 'Once Upon a Time historical price data MTGGoldfish'.\n   - WebSurfer: Click on the first relevant result and extract the all-time high and all-time low prices for the non-foil paper version released in its original set.\n   - Repeat the above steps for Veil of Summer, Wrenn and Six, and Narset, Parter of Veils.\n\n2. **Handle Timeouts**:\n   - WebSurfer: If a timeout occurs, use the `sleep(5)` function to wait for 5 seconds before attempting to interact with the page.\n\n3. **Calculate Price Decrease**:\n   - Assistant: Calculate the price decrease for each card using the formula: `all-time high - all-time low`.\n\n4. **Identify the Card with the Highest Price Decrease**:\n   - Assistant: Compare the price decreases and identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n5. **Final Verification**:\n   - WebSurfer: Double-check the results using MTGGoldfish or TCGplayer to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**: Include the card name, \"historical price data,\" and the source (MTGGoldfish or TCGplayer) in the search query.\n- **Wait for Page Load**: Use the `sleep` function to ensure the page has fully loaded before extracting data.\n- **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a simple retry mechanism to handle timeouts and ensure data is accurately extracted.\n\nWebSurfer, please search for 'Once Upon a Time historical price data MTGGoldfish'. Click on the first relevant result and extract the all-time high and all-time low prices for the non-foil paper version released in its original set. If the page takes longer to load, use the `sleep(5)` function to wait for 5 seconds before interacting with the page.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Timeout Errors**: The web surfer encountered timeout errors multiple times while trying to load pages, likely due to slow network conditions or the page taking too long to load.\n- **Inefficient Search Queries**: The search queries used were sometimes too broad, leading to irrelevant results or no results at all.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: The search did not always target specific sources known for reliable historical price data, such as MTGGoldfish or TCGplayer.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Use Direct URLs**: Navigate directly to the specific pages on MTGGoldfish for each card to avoid search-related issues.\n- **Implement Retry Mechanism**: Use a retry mechanism to handle timeouts and ensure the page loads completely.\n- **Extract Data Carefully**: Ensure the data extracted is accurate and relevant by carefully selecting the correct elements on the page.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Navigate Directly to MTGGoldfish Pages**:\n   - **Once Upon a Time**:\n     - WebSurfer: Navigate to 'https://www.mtggoldfish.com/price/Throne+of+Eldraine/Once+Upon+a+Time#paper'.\n     - WebSurfer: Extract the all-time high and all-time low prices for the non-foil paper version released in its original set.\n   - **Veil of Summer**:\n     - WebSurfer: Navigate to 'https://www.mtggoldfish.com/price/Core+Set+2020/Veil+of+Summer#paper'.\n     - WebSurfer: Extract the all-time high and all-time low prices for the non-foil paper version released in its original set.\n   - **Wrenn and Six**:\n     - WebSurfer: Navigate to 'https://www.mtggoldfish.com/price/Guilds+of+Ravnica/Wrenn+and+Six#paper'.\n     - WebSurfer: Extract the all-time high and all-time low prices for the non-foil paper version released in its original set.\n   - **Narset, Parter of Veils**:\n     - WebSurfer: Navigate to 'https://www.mtggoldfish.com/price/Core+Set+2020/Narset,+Parter+of+Veils#paper'.\n     - WebSurfer: Extract the all-time high and all-time low prices for the non-foil paper version released in its original set.\n\n2. **Handle Timeouts**:\n   - WebSurfer: If a timeout occurs, use the `sleep(5)` function to wait for 5 seconds before attempting to interact with the page.\n   - WebSurfer: Implement a retry mechanism to attempt the navigation and extraction up to 3 times if a timeout occurs.\n\n3. **Extract and Verify Data**:\n   - WebSurfer: Ensure the extracted data includes the all-time high and all-time low prices for each card.\n   - WebSurfer: Verify that the data is from the non-foil paper version released in its original set.\n\n4. **Calculate Price Decrease**:\n   - Assistant: Calculate the price decrease for each card using the formula: `all-time high - all-time low`.\n\n5. **Identify the Card with the Highest Price Decrease**:\n   - Assistant: Compare the price decreases and identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n6. **Final Verification**:\n   - WebSurfer: Double-check the results using MTGGoldfish to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Direct Navigation**: Use direct URLs to navigate to the specific pages on MTGGoldfish.\n- **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a simple retry mechanism to handle timeouts and ensure data is accurately extracted.\n- **Wait for Page Load**: Use the `sleep` function to ensure the page has fully loaded before extracting data.\n- **Specific Search Terms**: Ensure the search terms are specific and target the exact card and format (non-foil paper version).\n\nWebSurfer, please navigate to 'https://www.mtggoldfish.com/price/Throne+of+Eldraine/Once+Upon+a+Time#paper'.
