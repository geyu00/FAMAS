{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nOn Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request specifies the year 2021.\n   - The request refers to the \"fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\"\n   - The request asks about an amendment to the first rule in an article with \"witnesses\" in the most titles.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific federal rules that are listed alphabetically on the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute (LII).\n   - The exact content of the fifth section of these federal rules.\n   - The articles within the fifth section that have \"witnesses\" in their titles.\n   - The amendments made to the first rule in the article with the most titles containing \"witnesses\" as of 2021.\n   - The specific word that was deleted in the last amendment to this rule.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determining which article has the most titles containing \"witnesses\" based on the content available on the Cornell Law School LII website.\n   - Identifying the exact rule that was amended and the changes made to it, particularly the word that was deleted.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically might be related to \"Rules of Evidence\" or a similar category, given the common structure of legal documents.\n   - The word deleted in the amendment could be a common legal term, such as \"material,\" \"relevant,\" or \"testimony,\" but this is speculative without verifying the actual text.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nCertainly! Here’s a concise plan to address the original request:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify the Fifth Section of Federal Rules Alphabetically**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute (LII) website.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Locate the section of the website that lists federal rules alphabetically.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the fifth section in the alphabetical list.\n\n- **Step 2: Find Articles with \"Witnesses\" in Titles**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open the identified fifth section.\n  - **WebSurfer**: List all articles within this section.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the article(s) with \"witnesses\" in the most titles.\n\n- **Step 3: Locate the First Rule in the Identified Article**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open the article with the most titles containing \"witnesses.\"\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the first rule in this article.\n\n- **Step 4: Determine the Last Amendment to the First Rule in 2021**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check the history or amendments section for the identified rule.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last amendment made to this rule in 2021.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Note the specific changes made, particularly the word that was deleted.\n\n- **Step 5: Compile and Report the Findings**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings, including the word that was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article with the most titles containing \"witnesses.\"\n\nThis plan leverages WebSurfer's capabilities to navigate and extract information from the Cornell Law School LII website efficiently. The Assistant will compile and report the final findings."}

Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore §§501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty. This result may, however, be accomplished more directly, and without haggling in terms of legal standards, by the manner of administering the oath or affirmation under Rule 603. \n Admissibility of religious belief as a ground of impeachment is treated in Rule 610. Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93–650 \n Rule 601 as submitted to the Congress provided that “Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules.” One effect of the Rule as proposed would have been to abolish age, mental capacity, and other grounds recognized in some State jurisdictions as making a person incompetent as a witness. The greatest controversy centered around the Rule's rendering inapplicable in the federal courts the so-called Dead Man's Statutes which exist in some States. Acknowledging that there is substantial disagreement as to the merit of Dead Man's Statutes, the Committee nevertheless believed that where such statutes have been enacted they represent State policy which should not be overturned in the absence of a compelling federal interest. The Committee therefore amended the Rule to make competency in civil actions determinable in accordance with State law with respect to elements of claims or defenses as to which State law supplies the rule of decision. Cf. \n Courtland v. Walston & Co., Inc  ., 340 F.Supp. 1076, 1087–1092 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93–1277 \n The amendment to rule 601 parallels the treatment accorded rule 501 discussed immediately above. \n Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No. 93–1597 \n Rule 601 deals with competency of witnesses. Both the House and Senate bills provide that federal competency law applies in criminal cases. In civil actions and proceedings, the House bill provides that state competency law applies “to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision.” The Senate bill provides that “in civil actions and proceedings arising under \n 28 U.S.C. §1332  or \n 28 U.S.C. §1335  , or between citizens of different States and removed under \n 28 U.S.C. §1441(b)  the competency of a witness, person, government, State or political subdivision thereof is determined in accordance with State law, unless with respect to the particular claim or defense, Federal law supplies the rule of decision.” \n The wording of the House and Senate bills differs in the treatment of civil actions and proceedings. The rule in the House bill applies to evidence that relates to “an element of a claim or defense.” If an item of proof tends to support or defeat a claim or defense, or an element of a claim or defense, and if state law supplies the rule of decision for that claim or defense, then state competency law applies to that item of proof. \n For reasons similar to those underlying its action on Rule 501, the Conference adopts the House provision. \n Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment \nSponsored ListingsAlice A Salvo\nPREMIUM\n(818) 909-7045Woodland Hills, CAElder Law, Estate Planning, Probate, Tax Law\nWebsite\nEmail\nProfile\nPaul Danziger\nPREMIUM\n(800) 864-4000Richmond, CAAsbestos & Mesothelioma\nWebsite\nEmail\nProfile\nMichael Eric Kraut\nPREMIUM\n(310) 550-6935Beverly Hills, CACriminal Law, DUI & DWI, White Collar Crime, Domestic Violence, Juvenile Law\nWebsite\nEmail\nProfile\nAdam Dayan\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
