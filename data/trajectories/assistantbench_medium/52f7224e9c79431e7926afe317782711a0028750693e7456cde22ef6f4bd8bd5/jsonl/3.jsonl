It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have an IMDb rating.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) for purchase or rental.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDb ratings of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Vudu (Fandango at Home).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify which of Isabelle Adjani's feature films meet all the criteria (IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Vudu).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, so it is likely that one of her films meets the criteria.\n   - Given the popularity of streaming platforms, it is reasonable to assume that at least one of her films is available on Vudu (Fandango at Home).\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for a list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on IMDb.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to filter the list to include only films with a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n- **Step 3:** Use WebSurfer to check the IMDb ratings of the filtered films.\n- **Step 4:** Use WebSurfer to visit Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) and search for the availability of the top-rated films from the filtered list.\n- **Step 5:** Identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria (IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n- **Step 6:** Provide the final answer, including the film's title, IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home."}

Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have an IMDb rating.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) for purchase or rental.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDb ratings of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Vudu (Fandango at Home).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify which of Isabelle Adjani's feature films meet all the criteria (IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Vudu).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, so it is likely that one of her films meets the criteria.\n   - Given the popularity of streaming platforms, it is reasonable to assume that at least one of her films is available on Vudu (Fandango at Home).\n   - Some of Isabelle Adjani's well-known films, such as \"Possession\" (1981) and \"Camille Claudel\" (1988), are likely to have high IMDb ratings and may be available on popular streaming platforms.\n   - Films like \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979) and \"One Deadly Summer\" (1983) are also critically acclaimed and might fit the criteria of being less than 2 hours long and available on Vudu.\n\n**REASONING FOR NEW GUESSES:**\n- **Well-known films**: \"Possession,\" \"Camille Claudel,\" \"Nosferatu the Vampyre,\" and \"One Deadly Summer\" are among Isabelle Adjani's most famous and critically acclaimed works. These films are more likely to be widely available and to have high IMDb ratings.\n- **Runtime**: Many of Isabelle Adjani's films from the 1970s and 1980s tend to be under 2 hours, which increases the likelihood that they will meet the runtime requirement.\n- **Streaming platform availability**: Popular and critically acclaimed films are often prioritized for distribution on major streaming platforms, making it more likely that these films are available on Vudu (Fandango at Home).\n\nNext steps:\n1. **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to navigate to the 'Filmography' section of Isabelle Adjani's IMDb page and create a list of her feature films, noting the IMDb ratings and runtimes.\n2. **Step 2:** Filter the list to include only films with a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n3. **Step 3:** Check the IMDb ratings of the filtered films.\n4. **Step 4:** Use WebSurfer to visit Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) and search for the availability of the top-rated films from the filtered list.\n5. **Step 5:** Identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria (IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n6. **Step 6:** Provide the final answer, including the film's title, IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Navigation**: The WebSurfer did not efficiently navigate to the 'Filmography' section of Isabelle Adjani's IMDb page, leading to repeated scrolling without reaching the relevant information.\n2. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were too general, leading to a lack of focus on the specific information needed (IMDb ratings, runtimes, and filtering criteria).\n3. **No Verification of Content**: There was no verification step to ensure that the WebSurfer had reached the correct section of the page before proceeding to the next step.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to Filmography Section**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate directly to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the 'Filmography' section and confirm that the list of feature films is visible.\n\n2. **Extract Film Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes of all feature films listed in the 'Filmography' section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Create a list of films with the extracted information.\n\n3. **Filter Films by Runtime**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Filter the list to include only films with a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n\n4. **Check IMDb Ratings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the IMDb ratings of the filtered films and identify the highest-rated film.\n\n5. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) and search for the availability of the highest-rated film from the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm if the film is available for purchase or rental.\n\n6. **Provide Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the film's title, IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to Filmography Section**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the URL `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/`.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the 'Filmography' section and confirm that the list of feature films is visible.\n\n2. **Extract Film Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes of all feature films listed in the 'Filmography' section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Create a list of films with the extracted information.\n\n3. **Filter Films by Runtime**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Filter the list to include only films with a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n\n4. **Check IMDb Ratings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the IMDb ratings of the filtered films and identify the highest-rated film.\n\n5. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit `https://www.fandango.com/fandangoathome`.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the highest-rated film from the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm if the film is available for purchase or rental.\n\n6. **Provide Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the film's title, IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Hints for WebSurfer\n\n- **Scrolling**: Use specific scroll commands to reach the 'Filmography' section. For example, scroll down by a fixed number of pixels or use a search function to find the section.\n- **Verification**: Before proceeding to the next step, verify that the required information (titles, IMDb ratings, runtimes) is visible.\n- **Filtering**: Use specific criteria to filter the list of films (e.g., runtime < 2 hours).\n- **Searching**: Use the search function on Fandango at Home to find the film and confirm its availability.\n\nBy following this new plan and incorporating these hints, we can ensure more efficient and accurate navigation and data extraction."}

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n**WebSurfer**: Open the URL `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/` and scroll down to the 'Filmography' section. Extract the titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes of all feature films listed in this section.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Scrolling**: The WebSurfer did not efficiently navigate to the 'Filmography' section, leading to repeated scrolling without reaching the relevant information.\n2. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were too general, leading to a lack of focus on the specific information needed (IMDb ratings, runtimes, and filtering criteria).\n3. **No Verification of Content**: There was no verification step to ensure that the WebSurfer had reached the correct section of the page before proceeding to the next step.\n4. **Timeout Issues**: The initial attempt to visit the IMDb page timed out, indicating potential network or loading issues.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Visit IMDb Page and Ensure Full Load**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the URL `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/` and wait for the page to fully load.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the page has fully loaded by checking for specific elements (e.g., the 'Filmography' section header).\n\n2. **Navigate to Filmography Section**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use a search function to find the 'Filmography' section or scroll down by a fixed number of pixels to reach it.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the 'Filmography' section is visible and contains the list of feature films.\n\n3. **Extract Film Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes of all feature films listed in the 'Filmography' section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Create a list of films with the extracted information.\n\n4. **Filter Films by Runtime**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Filter the list to include only films with a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n\n5. **Check IMDb Ratings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the IMDb ratings of the filtered films and identify the highest-rated film.\n\n6. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit `https://www.fandango.com/fandangoathome`.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the highest-rated film from the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm if the film is available for purchase or rental.\n\n7. **Provide Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the film's title, IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Visit IMDb Page and Ensure Full Load**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the URL `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/`.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Wait for the page to fully load.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the 'Filmography' section is visible.\n\n2. **Navigate to Filmography Section**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use a search function to find the 'Filmography' section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the 'Filmography' section is visible and contains the list of feature films.\n\n3. **Extract Film Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes of all feature films listed in the 'Filmography' section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Create a list of films with the extracted information.\n\n4. **Filter Films by Runtime**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Filter the list to include only films with a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n\n5. **Check IMDb Ratings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the IMDb ratings of the filtered films and identify the highest-rated film.\n\n6. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit `https://www.fandango.com/fandangoathome`.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the highest-rated film from the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm if the film is available for purchase or rental.\n\n7. **Provide Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the film's title, IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Hints for WebSurfer\n\n- **Scrolling**: Use a specific scroll command to reach the 'Filmography' section. For example, scroll down by a fixed number of pixels or use a search function to find the section.\n- **Verification**: Before proceeding to the next step, verify that the required information (titles, IMDb ratings, runtimes) is visible.\n- **Filtering**: Use specific criteria to filter the list of films (e.g., runtime < 2 hours).\n- **Searching**: Use the search function on Fandango at Home to find the film and confirm its availability.\n- **Timeout Handling**: If the page does not load within a reasonable time, retry the visit or increase the timeout duration.\n\n### Action\n\n**WebSurfer**: Open the URL `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/` and wait for the page to fully load. Verify that the 'Filmography' section is visible. If not, use a search function to find the 'Filmography' section.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### Task Overview\n**Objective**: Identify the highest-rated (according to IMDb) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n#### Verified Facts\n- **IMDb Profile**: Isabelle Adjani's IMDb profile is located at `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/`.\n- **Filmography Section**: The 'Filmography' section on Isabelle Adjani's IMDb profile contains a list of her films, including titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes.\n- **Fandango at Home**: Vudu has been rebranded as Fandango at Home, and the website is `https://www.fandango.com/fandangoathome`.\n\n#### Educated Guesses and Hunches\n- **Filmography Extraction**: The 'Filmography' section on IMDb typically includes detailed information about each film, such as the title, IMDb rating, and runtime. We need to ensure we extract this information accurately.\n- **Runtime Filtering**: Many of Isabelle Adjani's films are likely to be feature-length, but we need to filter out those that are 2 hours or longer to meet the criteria.\n- **Highest-Rated Film**: Once we have a list of films that meet the runtime criteria, we can identify the highest-rated film according to IMDb.\n- **Availability on Fandango at Home**: After identifying the highest-rated film, we need to check its availability on Fandango at Home. This involves visiting the Fandango at Home website and searching for the film.\n\n#### Detailed Steps\n1. **Visit IMDb Page and Ensure Full Load**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the URL `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/` and wait for the page to fully load.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the 'Filmography' section is visible.\n\n2. **Navigate to Filmography Section**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search function to find the 'Filmography' section or scroll down by a fixed number of pixels to reach it.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the 'Filmography' section is visible and contains the list of feature films.\n\n3. **Extract Film Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes of all feature films listed in the 'Filmography' section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Create a list of films with the extracted information.\n\n4. **Filter Films by Runtime**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Filter the list to include only films with a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n\n5. **Check IMDb Ratings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the IMDb ratings of the filtered films and identify the highest-rated film.\n\n6. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit `https://www.fandango.com/fandangoathome`.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the highest-rated film from the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm if the film is available for purchase or rental.\n\n7. **Provide Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the film's title, IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n#### Hints for WebSurfer\n- **Scrolling**: Use a specific scroll command to reach the 'Filmography' section. For example, scroll down by a fixed number of pixels or use a search function to find the section.\n- **Verification**: Before proceeding to the next step, verify that the required information (titles, IMDb ratings, runtimes) is visible.\n- **Filtering**: Use specific criteria to filter the list of films (e.g., runtime < 2 hours).\n- **Searching**: Use the search function on Fandango at Home to find the film and confirm its availability.\n- **Timeout Handling**: If the page does not load within a reasonable time, retry the visit or increase the timeout duration.\n\n### Action\n**WebSurfer**: Open the URL `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/` and wait for the page to fully load.
