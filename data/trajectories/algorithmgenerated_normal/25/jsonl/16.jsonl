Which of these words is used to describe a type of society in a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016? Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify the figure with three axes in the AI regulation paper submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022, extract the label words at both ends of each axis, and check the Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016, for any of these label words. Determine which of these words is used to describe a type of society in the 2016 article.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The AI regulation expert will locate the figure with three axes in the June 2022 paper and extract the label words at both ends of each axis.\n2. The Physics and Society expert will check the August 2016 article for any of these label words and determine which one describes a type of society.\n3. The checker will verify the accuracy and consistency of the findings.\n\n## Output format\n- List of label words at both ends of each axis from the June 2022 paper.\n- The word used to describe a type of society in the August 2016 article.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure the label words are accurately extracted from the figure in the June 2022 paper.\n- Verify that the word describing a type of society in the August 2016 article matches one of the label words from the June 2022 paper."}
