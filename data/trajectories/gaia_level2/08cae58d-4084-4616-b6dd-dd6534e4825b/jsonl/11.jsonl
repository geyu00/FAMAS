It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request asks about the first year the Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - Google Finance is mentioned as a potential source of information.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact date or year when Apple's stock price first exceeded $50.\n   - Historical stock prices of Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance or another reliable financial data source.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Adjusting for stock splits to ensure the $50 threshold is considered correctly.\n   - Verifying that the year identified is indeed the first year the stock surpassed $50 without considering any splits.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock price has had several significant splits over the years, which could affect the historical price data.\n   - The stock price likely reached $50 sometime in the early to mid-2000s, given the company's growth trajectory during that period.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to navigate to Google Finance and search for historical Apple (AAPL) stock prices.\n- **Step 2:** Instruct WebSurfer to find the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50, ensuring that the data is not adjusted for stock splits.\n- **Step 3:** Verify the year identified by cross-checking with another reliable financial data source if necessary.\n- **Step 4:** Document the findings and provide the year when Apple's stock first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits."}

For example, Apple had a 7-for-1 split in June 2014 and a 4-for-1 split in August 2020.\n   - The stock price likely reached $50 sometime in the early to mid-2000s, given the company's growth trajectory during that period. However, due to the significant splits, the actual year might be different when considering the unadjusted prices.\n   - Given the splits, it is possible that the unadjusted price first exceeded $50 in the late 1990s or early 2000s, before the major splits occurred.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The inclusion of specific split details helps in understanding how the stock price has been affected over the years.\n- Considering the significant splits, it is important to look at the unadjusted prices to accurately determine when the stock first exceeded $50.\n- The early to mid-2000s is still a reasonable guess, but the late 1990s should also be considered due to the impact of splits on historical prices.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Element Not Found**: The error indicates that the web surfer was unable to find the specific element (likely a button or link) needed to navigate to the historical prices section. This could be due to the element not being present in the current viewport or the element having a different ID or class name than expected.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Step 1:** Navigate to the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance.\n- **Step 2:** Scroll down to the historical prices section manually if necessary.\n- **Step 3:** If the historical prices section is not immediately visible, search for a button or link that says \"Historical Prices\" or \"View Historical Data\" and click it.\n- **Step 4:** Once in the historical prices section, find the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50, ensuring that the data is not adjusted for stock splits.\n- **Step 5:** Verify the year identified by cross-checking with another reliable financial data source if necessary.\n- **Step 6:** Document the findings and provide the year when Apple's stock first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n### Detailed Instructions:\n1. **Navigate to Apple (AAPL) Stock Page:**\n   - Open the URL: `https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ`.\n\n2. **Scroll Down to Historical Prices Section:**\n   - Scroll down the page to locate the historical prices section. If the section is not visible, continue scrolling until it appears.\n\n3. **Find and Click Historical Prices Button:**\n   - Look for a button or link labeled \"Historical Prices\" or \"View Historical Data.\"\n   - If the button is not immediately visible, try searching for it using the search function within the page or by inspecting the page elements.\n\n4. **Identify the Earliest Date or Year When Stock Price Exceeded $50:**\n   - Once in the historical prices section, use the chart or table to find the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n   - Ensure that the data is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n5. **Verify the Year:**\n   - Cross-check the identified year with another reliable financial data source if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Document Findings:**\n   - Provide the year when Apple's stock first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Manual Interaction:** If the web surfer is unable to find the element automatically, manually guide it to the correct section.\n- **Inspect Elements:** Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the elements and ensure the correct IDs or class names are being targeted.\n- **Wait for Page Load:** If the page is slow to load, use the `sleep` function to wait for the page to fully load before attempting to interact with elements."}

It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no,minimal-ui\",\n        \"google-site-verification\": \"sxp7zFOFUzk09RdlFhuH2SoCn5nOkXgomiLeLIQ48p0\",\n        \"mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"application-name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-title\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\": \"default\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"msapplication-tap-highlight\": \"no\",\n        \"description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_770x402.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"770\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"402\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary\",\n        \"twitter:site\": \"@google\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_496x496.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

For example, Apple had a 7-for-1 split in June 2014 and a 4-for-1 split in August 2020.\n   - The stock price likely reached $50 sometime in the early to mid-2000s, given the company's growth trajectory during that period.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request asks about the first year the Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n- Apple's stock price has had several significant splits over the years, which could affect the historical price data.\n- We have accessed the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Yahoo Finance and are currently navigating through the historical prices section.\n- Apple had a 7-for-1 split in June 2014 and a 4-for-1 split in August 2020.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The exact date or year when Apple's stock price first exceeded $50.\n- Historical stock prices of Apple (AAPL) on Yahoo Finance or another reliable financial data source.\n- Specific details of Apple's stock splits, including dates and split ratios, to ensure accurate interpretation of historical prices.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Adjusting for stock splits to ensure the $50 threshold is considered correctly.\n- Verifying that the year identified is indeed the first year the stock surpassed $50 without considering any splits.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Updated Guess:** The unadjusted price of Apple stock likely first exceeded $50 in the late 1990s or early 2000s, before the major splits occurred. This is based on the company's growth trajectory and the significant impact of stock splits on historical prices.\n- **Reasoning:** Given the significant stock splits in 2014 and 2020, the unadjusted prices from earlier years would be much higher. The early 2000s saw a significant rise in Apple's stock price, and it is plausible that the unadjusted price first exceeded $50 during this period.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Navigate to Apple (AAPL) Stock Page on Yahoo Finance:**\n   - Open the URL: `https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history`.\n\n2. **Scroll Down to Historical Prices Section:**\n   - Scroll down the page to locate the historical prices section. If the section is not immediately visible, continue scrolling until it appears.\n\n3. **Find and Click Historical Prices Button:**\n   - Look for a button or link labeled \"Historical Prices\" or \"View Historical Data.\"\n   - If the button is not immediately visible, try searching for it using the search function within the page or by inspecting the page elements.\n\n4. **Identify the Earliest Date or Year When Stock Price Exceeded $50:**\n   - Once in the historical prices section, use the chart or table to find the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n   - Ensure that the data is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n5. **Verify the Year:**\n   - Cross-check the identified year with another reliable financial data source if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Document Findings:**\n   - Provide the year when Apple's stock first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n### Detailed Instructions:\n1. **Navigate to Apple (AAPL) Stock Page:**\n   - Open the URL: `https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history`.\n\n2. **Scroll Down to Historical Prices Section:**\n   - Scroll down the page to locate the historical prices section. If the section is not visible, continue scrolling until it appears.\n\n3. **Find and Click Historical Prices Button:**\n   - Look for a button or link labeled \"Historical Prices\" or \"View Historical Data.\"\n   - If the button is not immediately visible, try searching for it using the search function within the page or by inspecting the page elements.\n\n4. **Identify the Earliest Date or Year When Stock Price Exceeded $50:**\n   - Once in the historical prices section, use the chart or table to find the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n   - Ensure that the data is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n5. **Verify the Year:**\n   - Cross-check the identified year with another reliable financial data source if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Document Findings:**\n   - Provide the year when Apple's stock first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Manual Interaction:** If the web surfer is unable to find the element automatically, manually guide it to the correct section.\n- **Inspect Elements:** Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the elements and ensure the correct IDs or class names are being targeted.\n- **Wait for Page Load:** If the page is slow to load, use the `sleep` function to wait for the page to fully load before attempting to interact with elements.\n\nPlease navigate to the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Yahoo Finance by opening the URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history. Continue scrolling down to the historical prices section and locate the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Element Not Found**: The web surfer was unable to find the specific element (button or link) needed to navigate to the historical prices section on Yahoo Finance.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request asks about the first year the Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n- Apple's stock price has had several significant splits over the years, which could affect the historical price data.\n- We have accessed the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Yahoo Finance and are currently navigating through the historical prices section.\n- Apple had a 7-for-1 split in June 2014 and a 4-for-1 split in August 2020.\n- The historical prices section on Yahoo Finance provides data for recent years, but we need to scroll further down or adjust the date range to view older data.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The exact date or year when Apple's stock price first exceeded $50.\n- Historical stock prices of Apple (AAPL) on Yahoo Finance or another reliable financial data source.\n- Specific details of Apple's stock splits, including dates and split ratios, to ensure accurate interpretation of historical prices.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Adjusting for stock splits to ensure the $50 threshold is considered correctly.\n- Verifying that the year identified is indeed the first year the stock surpassed $50 without considering any splits.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Updated Guess:** The unadjusted price of Apple stock likely first exceeded $50 in the mid-2000s, specifically around 2005 or 2006.\n- **Reasoning:** Based on the company's growth trajectory and the significant impact of stock splits, the unadjusted prices from the mid-2000s would be much higher. Apple experienced substantial growth during this period, and it is plausible that the unadjusted price first exceeded $50 during these years. Additionally, the stock price data we have seen so far indicates that the stock was already well above $50 in the late 2000s, suggesting that the milestone was likely reached earlier.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Navigate to Apple (AAPL) Stock Page on Yahoo Finance:**\n   - Open the URL: `https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history`.\n\n2. **Scroll Down to Historical Prices Section:**\n   - Scroll down the page to locate the historical prices section. If the section is not immediately visible, continue scrolling until it appears.\n\n3. **Adjust Date Range to View Older Data:**\n   - Use the date range selector to view historical prices from the early 2000s. Specifically, set the date range to include years from 2000 to 2007.\n\n4. **Identify the Earliest Date or Year When Stock Price Exceeded $50:**\n   - Once in the historical prices section, use the chart or table to find the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n   - Ensure that the data is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n5. **Verify the Year:**\n   - Cross-check the identified year with another reliable financial data source if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Document Findings:**\n   - Provide the year when Apple's stock first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n### Detailed Instructions:\n1. **Navigate to Apple (AAPL) Stock Page:**\n   - Open the URL: `https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history`.\n\n2. **Scroll Down to Historical Prices Section:**\n   - Scroll down the page to locate the historical prices section. If the section is not visible, continue scrolling until it appears.\n\n3. **Adjust Date Range to View Older Data:**\n   - Locate the date range selector and set it to include years from 2000 to 2007. This will allow us to view the historical prices from the early 2000s.\n\n4. **Identify the Earliest Date or Year When Stock Price Exceeded $50:**\n   - Once in the historical prices section, use the chart or table to find the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n   - Ensure that the data is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n5. **Verify the Year:**\n   - Cross-check the identified year with another reliable financial data source if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Document Findings:**\n   - Provide the year when Apple's stock first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Manual Interaction:** If the web surfer is unable to find the element automatically, manually guide it to the correct section.\n- **Inspect Elements:** Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the elements and ensure the correct IDs or class names are being targeted.\n- **Wait for Page Load:** If the page is slow to load, use the `sleep` function to wait for the page to fully load before attempting to interact with elements.\n\nPlease navigate to the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Yahoo Finance by opening the URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history. Scroll down to the historical prices section, adjust the date range to include years from 2000 to 2007, and locate the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Scrolling Inefficiency:** The web surfer was manually scrolling down the page, which is inefficient and does not guarantee reaching the desired historical data quickly.\n- **Date Range Adjustment:** The date range was not adjusted to view older data, which is crucial for finding the earliest date when the stock price exceeded $50.\n- **Lack of Specific Element Interaction:** The web surfer did not specifically interact with the date range selector, which is necessary to view historical data from the early 2000s.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Navigate to Apple (AAPL) Stock Page on Yahoo Finance:**\n   - Open the URL: `https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history`.\n\n2. **Locate and Adjust Date Range Selector:**\n   - Scroll down to the historical prices section.\n   - Find and click the date range selector (usually a dropdown or input field).\n   - Set the date range to include years from 2000 to 2007.\n\n3. **Ensure Page is Fully Loaded:**\n   - Use the `sleep` function to wait for the page to fully load after adjusting the date range.\n\n4. **Identify the Earliest Date or Year When Stock Price Exceeded $50:**\n   - Use the chart or table to find the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n   - Ensure that the data is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n5. **Verify the Year:**\n   - Cross-check the identified year with another reliable financial data source if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Document Findings:**\n   - Provide the year when Apple's stock first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n### Detailed Instructions:\n- **Step 1: Navigate to Apple (AAPL) Stock Page**\n  - Open the URL: `https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history`.\n\n- **Step 2: Locate and Adjust Date Range Selector**\n  - Scroll down to the historical prices section.\n  - Find and click the date range selector.\n  - Set the date range to include years from 2000 to 2007.\n\n- **Step 3: Ensure Page is Fully Loaded**\n  - Use the `sleep` function to wait for the page to fully load after adjusting the date range.\n  - Example: `sleep(5)` to wait for 5 seconds.\n\n- **Step 4: Identify the Earliest Date or Year When Stock Price Exceeded $50**\n  - Use the chart or table to find the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n  - Ensure that the data is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n- **Step 5: Verify the Year**\n  - Cross-check the identified year with another reliable financial data source if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Step 6: Document Findings**\n  - Provide the year when Apple's stock first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Manual Interaction:** If the web surfer is unable to find the element automatically, manually guide it to the correct section.\n- **Inspect Elements:** Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the elements and ensure the correct IDs or class names are being targeted.\n- **Wait for Page Load:** If the page is slow to load, use the `sleep` function to wait for the page to fully load before attempting to interact with elements.\n\nPlease navigate to the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Yahoo Finance by opening the URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history.

It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no,minimal-ui\",\n        \"google-site-verification\": \"sxp7zFOFUzk09RdlFhuH2SoCn5nOkXgomiLeLIQ48p0\",\n        \"mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"application-name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-title\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\": \"default\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"msapplication-tap-highlight\": \"no\",\n        \"description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_770x402.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"770\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"402\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary\",\n        \"twitter:site\": \"@google\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_496x496.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
