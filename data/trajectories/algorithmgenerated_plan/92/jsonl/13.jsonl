Since the specific code isn't provided in the initial context, please provide the code snippet you are attempting to run. This will allow me to analyze it for any syntax or logical errors.\n\n### Step 2: Debug the Code\nOnce I have the code, I will check for any obvious mistakes or issues, such as syntax errors, missing imports, incorrect function calls, etc.\n\n### Step 3: Optimize and Correct the Code\nIf I identify any issues, I will correct them and optimize the code where necessary.\n\n### Step 4: Verification\nI will run the corrected code to ensure that it executes successfully and provides the expected output.\n\nPlease share the code that is causing the problem so we can proceed with the analysis and debugging."}
