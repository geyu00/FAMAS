Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The time period of interest is from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The location of interest is Seattle.\n   - The specific time frame is the first week of September.\n   - The definition of a rainy day is at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical weather data for Seattle during the first week of September for the years 2020 to 2023.\n   - Precipitation records for the specified period and location.\n   - Sources: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Weather Underground, or local meteorological services.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation during the first week of September for each year from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The total number of days in the first week of September for each year from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The percentage likelihood of hitting a rainy day based on the derived data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Seattle is known for its rainy climate, but the first week of September is generally part of the drier late summer period.\n   - Based on general knowledge, the likelihood of rain in early September in Seattle is moderate but not as high as in the winter months. However, this is a rough estimate and needs verification with actual data.\n   - **New Guess**: The Weather Underground website may require a more precise selection of dates rather than a broad range. We should try selecting the specific dates for each year individually to ensure accurate data retrieval.\n\n5. **ADDITIONAL NOTES**\n   - The Weather Underground interface might be more effective if we select the specific dates for each year individually rather than trying to input a broad range. This could help in retrieving more accurate and detailed historical weather data.\n   - We should verify if the Weather Underground site allows for custom date ranges spanning multiple years or if we need to query each year separately.\n\nLet's proceed by selecting the specific dates for each year individually to gather the required data. For example, we can start with the first week of September 2020, then move on to 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Weather Underground site and enter 'Seattle, WA' as the location.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Set the Date to 'Custom Range' and specify the start date as 'September 1, 2020' and the end date as 'September 7, 2020'.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2020.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Repeat the process for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023, noting the daily precipitation amounts for each year.\n\nPlease proceed with these steps to gather the necessary data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Input Field**: The repeated issue was attempting to input 'Custom Range' into the 'Month Selection' field instead of the 'Date' field. This led to no change in the date selection and prevented the correct historical weather data from being retrieved.\n- **Lack of Specific Date Selection**: The attempt to use a broad date range for multiple years in a single query might not be supported by the Weather Underground site. Each year's data should be queried separately for accuracy.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Weather Underground**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Weather Underground site and navigate to the Historical Weather page.\n\n2. **Select Location**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter 'Seattle, WA' in the 'Location' field.\n\n3. **Set Custom Date Range for Each Year**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023):\n     - Specify the start date as 'September 1' and the end date as 'September 7'.\n     - Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September for that year.\n     - Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n4. **Extract and Summarize Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each year, extract the daily precipitation amounts and note the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the data for all four years.\n\n5. **Calculate the Likelihood**:\n   - **Assistant**: Use the extracted data to calculate the total number of rainy days (≥0.5mm) and the total number of days in the first week of September for the specified years.\n   - **Assistant**: Compute the percentage likelihood of hitting a rainy day during the first week of September in Seattle from 2020 to 2023.\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final percentage likelihood of encountering a rainy day during the first week of September in Seattle based on the data from 2020 to 2023.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Open Weather Underground**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Weather Underground site and go to the Historical Weather page.\n\n2. **Enter Location**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter 'Seattle, WA' in the 'Location' field.\n\n3. **Set Custom Date Range for 2020**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Specify the start date as 'September 1, 2020' and the end date as 'September 7, 2020'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2020.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n4. **Repeat for 2021**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Specify the start date as 'September 1, 2021' and the end date as 'September 7, 2021'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2021.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n5. **Repeat for 2022**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Specify the start date as 'September 1, 2022' and the end date as 'September 7, 2022'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2022.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n6. **Repeat for 2023**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Specify the start date as 'September 1, 2023' and the end date as 'September 7, 2023'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2023.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n7. **Summarize Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the data for all four years, noting the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation for each year.\n\n8. **Calculate the Likelihood**:\n   - **Assistant**: Use the summarized data to calculate the total number of rainy days (≥0.5mm) and the total number of days in the first week of September for the specified years.\n   - **Assistant**: Compute the percentage likelihood of hitting a rainy day during the first week of September in Seattle from 2020 to 2023.\n\n9. **Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final percentage likelihood of encountering a rainy day during the first week of September in Seattle based on the data from 2020 to 2023.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan to gather the necessary data."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nBased on recent years (2020-2023), how likely am I to hit a rainy day (at least 0.5mm of precipitation) if I travel to Seattle during the first week of September? (provide the answer in percentage)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet, incorporating the new insights and ensuring clarity:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The time period of interest is from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The location of interest is Seattle, WA.\n   - The specific time frame is the first week of September.\n   - The definition of a rainy day is at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical weather data for Seattle during the first week of September for the years 2020 to 2023.\n   - Precipitation records for the specified period and location.\n   - Sources: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Weather Underground, or local meteorological services.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation during the first week of September for each year from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The total number of days in the first week of September for each year from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The percentage likelihood of hitting a rainy day based on the derived data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Seattle is known for its rainy climate, but the first week of September is generally part of the drier late summer period.\n   - Based on general knowledge, the likelihood of rain in early September in Seattle is moderate but not as high as in the winter months. However, this is a rough estimate and needs verification with actual data.\n   - **New Guess**: The Weather Underground website requires manual selection of specific dates for each year to ensure accurate data retrieval. Attempting to input a broad date range might not yield the desired results.\n   - **Updated Guess**: The Weather Underground site might have a more user-friendly interface for selecting custom date ranges if we navigate through the dropdown menus rather than typing directly into the fields.\n\n5. **ADDITIONAL NOTES**\n   - The Weather Underground interface might be more effective if we select the specific dates for each year individually rather than trying to input a broad range. This could help in retrieving more accurate and detailed historical weather data.\n   - We should verify if the Weather Underground site allows for custom date ranges spanning multiple years or if we need to query each year separately.\n   - **New Note**: Ensure that the 'Month Selection', 'Day Selection', and 'Year Selection' dropdowns are used correctly to avoid input errors.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to Weather Underground**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Weather Underground site and navigate to the Historical Weather page.\n\n2. **Enter Location**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter 'Seattle, WA' in the 'Location' field.\n\n3. **Set Custom Date Range for 2020**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown, '1' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown, and '2020' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown for the start date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown, '7' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown, and '2020' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown for the end date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2020.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n4. **Repeat for 2021**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown, '1' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown, and '2021' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown for the start date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown, '7' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown, and '2021' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown for the end date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2021.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n5. **Repeat for 2022**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown, '1' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown, and '2022' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown for the start date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown, '7' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown, and '2022' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown for the end date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2022.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n6. **Repeat for 2023**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown, '1' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown, and '2023' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown for the start date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown, '7' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown, and '2023' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown for the end date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2023.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n7. **Summarize Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the data for all four years, noting the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation for each year.\n\n8. **Calculate the Likelihood**:\n   - **Assistant**: Use the summarized data to calculate the total number of rainy days (≥0.5mm) and the total number of days in the first week of September for the specified years.\n   - **Assistant**: Compute the percentage likelihood of hitting a rainy day during the first week of September in Seattle from 2020 to 2023.\n\n9. **Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final percentage likelihood of encountering a rainy day during the first week of September in Seattle based on the data from 2020 to 2023.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Weather Underground site and enter 'Seattle, WA' as the location.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range' and manually select the start date as 'September 1, 2020' and the end date as 'September 7, 2020'.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2020.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\nPlease proceed with these steps to gather the necessary data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Input Method**: The repeated issue was attempting to type the month, day, and year directly into the 'Month Selection', 'Day Selection', and 'Year Selection' fields instead of using the dropdown menus. This led to the form not recognizing the inputs correctly.\n- **Lack of Manual Dropdown Selection**: The Weather Underground site requires the use of dropdown menus for selecting specific dates. Typing directly into these fields did not register the correct values.\n- **Inconsistent Form Submission**: The form submission was not triggered correctly due to the incorrect input method, leading to no data being retrieved.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Weather Underground**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Weather Underground site and navigate to the Historical Weather page.\n\n2. **Enter Location**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter 'Seattle, WA' in the 'Location' field.\n\n3. **Set Custom Date Range for 2020**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '1' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '2020' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown again for the end date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '7' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '2020' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2020.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n4. **Repeat for 2021**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '1' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '2021' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown again for the end date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '7' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '2021' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2021.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n5. **Repeat for 2022**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '1' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '2022' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown again for the end date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '7' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '2022' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2022.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n6. **Repeat for 2023**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '1' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '2023' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown again for the end date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '7' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '2023' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2023.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n7. **Summarize Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the data for all four years, noting the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation for each year.\n\n8. **Calculate the Likelihood**:\n   - **Assistant**: Use the summarized data to calculate the total number of rainy days (≥0.5mm) and the total number of days in the first week of September for the specified years.\n   - **Assistant**: Compute the percentage likelihood of hitting a rainy day during the first week of September in Seattle from 2020 to 2023.\n\n9. **Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final percentage likelihood of encountering a rainy day during the first week of September in Seattle based on the data from 2020 to 2023.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Use Dropdown Menus**: Always use the dropdown menus for selecting months, days, and years. Do not type directly into these fields.\n- **Double-Check Inputs**: Before submitting the form, double-check that the correct dates are selected in the dropdown menus.\n- **Manual Selection**: Ensure that each selection is made manually to avoid any automated input issues.\n- **Form Submission**: After setting the dates, click the 'Submit' button to ensure the form is submitted correctly.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan to gather the necessary data."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nBased on recent years (2020-2023), how likely am I to hit a rainy day (at least 0.5mm of precipitation) if I travel to Seattle during the first week of September? (provide the answer in percentage)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet, incorporating the new insights and ensuring clarity:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The time period of interest is from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The location of interest is Seattle, WA.\n   - The specific time frame is the first week of September.\n   - The definition of a rainy day is at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical weather data for Seattle during the first week of September for the years 2020 to 2023.\n   - Precipitation records for the specified period and location.\n   - Sources: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Weather Underground, or local meteorological services.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation during the first week of September for each year from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The total number of days in the first week of September for each year from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The percentage likelihood of hitting a rainy day based on the derived data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Seattle is known for its rainy climate, but the first week of September is generally part of the drier late summer period.\n   - Based on general knowledge, the likelihood of rain in early September in Seattle is moderate but not as high as in the winter months. However, this is a rough estimate and needs verification with actual data.\n   - **New Guess**: The Weather Underground website requires manual selection of specific dates for each year to ensure accurate data retrieval. Attempting to input a broad date range might not yield the desired results.\n   - **Updated Guess**: The Weather Underground site might have a more user-friendly interface for selecting custom date ranges if we navigate through the dropdown menus rather than typing directly into the fields.\n   - **New Guess**: The Weather Underground site might require a more precise selection of dates, and the form might need to be submitted after each selection to ensure the correct data is retrieved.\n\n5. **ADDITIONAL NOTES**\n   - The Weather Underground interface might be more effective if we select the specific dates for each year individually rather than trying to input a broad range. This could help in retrieving more accurate and detailed historical weather data.\n   - We should verify if the Weather Underground site allows for custom date ranges spanning multiple years or if we need to query each year separately.\n   - **New Note**: Ensure that the 'Month Selection', 'Day Selection', and 'Year Selection' dropdowns are used correctly to avoid input errors.\n   - **New Note**: After selecting each date, click 'Submit' immediately to ensure the form is processed correctly.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to Weather Underground**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Weather Underground site and navigate to the Historical Weather page.\n\n2. **Enter Location**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter 'Seattle, WA' in the 'Location' field.\n\n3. **Set Custom Date Range for 2020**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '1' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '2020' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown again for the end date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '7' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '2020' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Submit' to retrieve the historical weather data for the first week of September 2020.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the daily precipitation amounts and count the number of days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation.\n\n4. **Repeat for 2021**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the 'Date' to 'Custom Range'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '1' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '2021' from the 'Year Selection' dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select 'September' from the 'Month Selection' dropdown again for the end date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually select '7' from the 'Day Selection' dropdown.\n   -

Do not type directly into these fields.\n- **Immediate Form Submission**: After selecting the end date, click 'Submit' immediately to ensure the form is processed correctly.\n- **Double-Check Inputs**: Before submitting the form, double-check that the correct dates are selected in the dropdown menus.\n- **Manual Selection**: Ensure that each selection is made manually to avoid any automated input issues.\n- **Form Submission**: After setting the dates, click the 'Submit' button to ensure the form is submitted correctly.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan to gather the necessary data."}
