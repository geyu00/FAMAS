It blew out a huge bi-lobed bubble that blasted through the interstellar medium in two directions. Whatever it was, it released huge amounts of energy from the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A\n (Sgr A for short).\nThese bubbles contain weird, spindly one-dimensional vertical filaments that emit radio signals of their own. In 1984, astronomer Farhad Yusef-Zadeh at Northwestern University and his collaborators were \nthe first to observe these wispy trails. Now, they know of more than a thousand of them. They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

However, these aren't vertical. Instead, they lie along the galactic plane and radiate away like spokes on a wheel. \"It was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole,\" Yusef-Zadeh said. \"We have always been thinking about vertical filaments and their origin. I'm used to them being vertical. I never considered there might be others along the plane.\"\nHe and the team were stunned when they saw these radially stretched structures. \"We had to do a lot of work to establish that we weren't fooling ourselves,\" he said. \"And we found that these filaments are not random but appear to be tied to the outflow of our black hole. By studying them, we could learn more about the black hole's spin and accretion disk orientation. It is satisfying when one finds order in a middle of a chaotic field of the nucleus of our galaxy.\"\nYusef-Zadeh pointed out that something clearly occurred in the core to create the short radial filaments. \"We think they must have originated with some kind of outflow from an activity that happened a few million years ago,\" he said. \"It seems to be the result of an interaction of that outflowing material with objects near it.\"\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Then, it \"burps out\" an energetic, highly magnetized blast of energy and plasma. That seems the most likely explanation for the appearance of the bubbles and filaments. It's possible that such a jet collided with clouds of gas and dust in the immediate neighborhood. It could have led to twisted magnetic structures that form the filaments.\nAnother idea is that molecular gas got stretched by the expansion of the material near the core. That somehow creates the radial filaments. Such action would also explain the lopsided appearance of the Sgr E complex. It lies to one side of the black hole at the intersection of the central molecular zone and a wide central dust lane. Finally, it's also possible that the gravitational potential of our galaxy's central bar is tugging the Sgr E cloud. That could play a role in forming those filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

That could play a role in forming those filaments.\nThe vertical ones pose a different challenge to understand. They tower up to 150 light-years above the plane of the galaxy. Yusef-Zadeh and his team suggest a couple of ideas for their existence. The first is cosmic-ray pressure forcing filaments into a vertical orientation. That pressure is the aftermath of the explosive event a few million years ago that created the bubbles.\nSome verticals could be the result of the interaction of a large-scale wind in the region and obstacles embedded within the flow. That combination creates filaments by wrapping the wind's magnetic field around the obstacles. Clearly, there's a lot of observation work and analysis to be done in order to really understand what's happening to create both sets of filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
