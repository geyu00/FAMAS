Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The plan is to visit California's Great America in San Jose once a month in June, July, August, and September during the summer of 2024.\n   - The comparison is between purchasing a season pass and buying daily tickets.\n   - The official California's Great America website is accessible and contains information about tickets and passes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact cost of a season pass for California's Great America in 2024.\n   - The exact cost of a single-day ticket for California's Great America in 2024.\n   - Any potential discounts or promotions that might affect the cost of either the season pass or daily tickets.\n   - Specific locations to find this information:\n     - Official California's Great America website.\n     - Customer service or help desk of California's Great America.\n     - Recent press releases or news articles about pricing for the 2024 season.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Total cost of purchasing four single-day tickets (one for each month: June, July, August, and September).\n   - Savings amount by comparing the total cost of four single-day tickets to the cost of a season pass.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Season passes often provide a significant discount compared to the cost of multiple single-day tickets.\n   - The cost of a single-day ticket is likely to be in the range of $50 to $80 based on typical pricing for amusement parks in the United States.\n   - The cost of a season pass might be around $100 to $150, but this is a rough estimate and needs verification.\n   - The website mentions that a season pass pays for itself in less than two visits, which suggests that the cost of a season pass is less than twice the cost of a single-day ticket. This implies that the season pass is likely to be a better value for frequent visitors.\n\n**Additional Hunches:**\n   - The website indicates that a season pass includes free parking, which could add additional value beyond just the admission cost.\n   - Given the promotional language on the website, there might be special offers or discounts available that could further reduce the cost of both single-day tickets and season passes.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step to find the exact costs of the single-day ticket and the season pass. Please navigate to the 'Daily Tickets' and 'Season Passes' sections on the official California's Great America website and extract the specific prices for the 2024 season.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigation Issues**: The WebSurfer did not successfully navigate to the specific sections of the website where the pricing information for daily tickets and season passes is located.\n- **Inefficient Scrolling**: The WebSurfer was instructed to scroll down one page at a time, which did not ensure that the relevant sections were brought into view.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions given to the WebSurfer were too general and did not specify the exact elements or sections to look for, leading to incomplete information extraction.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate Directly to Pricing Page**\n  - WebSurfer will navigate directly to the \"Tickets & Passes\" section of the official California's Great America website.\n  - WebSurfer will click on the \"Daily Tickets\" and \"Season Passes\" links to ensure the relevant sections are loaded.\n\n- **Step 2: Extract Specific Pricing Information**\n  - WebSurfer will extract the exact cost of a single-day ticket and the exact cost of a season pass for the 2024 season.\n  - WebSurfer will verify that the extracted information is for the 2024 season.\n\n- **Step 3: Calculate Total Cost of Single-Day Tickets**\n  - Assistant will calculate the total cost of purchasing four single-day tickets (one for each month: June, July, August, and September).\n\n- **Step 4: Calculate Savings**\n  - Assistant will subtract the cost of the season pass from the total cost of the four single-day tickets to determine the savings.\n\n- **Step 5: Present Results**\n  - Assistant will summarize the findings and present the savings amount to the user.\n\n### Detailed Instructions for WebSurfer\n\n1. **Navigate to the Pricing Page**\n   - Open the official California's Great America website: [https://www.cagreatamerica.com/](https://www.cagreatamerica.com/)\n   - Click on the \"Tickets & Passes\" link in the navigation menu.\n\n2. **Extract Daily Ticket Price**\n   - Scroll down to the \"Daily Tickets\" section.\n   - Extract the cost of a single-day ticket for the 2024 season.\n\n3. **Extract Season Pass Price**\n   - Scroll down to the \"Season Passes\" section.\n   - Extract the cost of a season pass for the 2024 season.\n\n4. **Verify Information**\n   - Ensure that the extracted prices are for the 2024 season.\n   - If any discounts or promotions are mentioned, note them as well.\n\n### Example Commands for WebSurfer\n\n```plaintext\n1. Open the official California's Great America website: https://www.cagreatamerica.com/\n2. Click on the \"Tickets & Passes\" link in the navigation menu.\n3. Scroll down to the \"Daily Tickets\" section and extract the cost of a single-day ticket for the 2024 season.\n4. Scroll down to the \"Season Passes\" section and extract the cost of a season pass for the 2024 season.\n5. Verify that the extracted prices are for the 2024 season.\n```\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}
