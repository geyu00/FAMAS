The cost of the Silver Pass for the 2025 season is $89, which includes unlimited visits through Labor Day. The validity period for the Silver Pass covers June, July, August, and September. Since the 2024 season pass options are not explicitly listed, we will assume the 2024 season pass has a similar cost and validity period as the 2025 Silver Pass. Calculations: Total cost of four single-day tickets: 4 * 40 = 160. Cost of the season pass: 89. Savings: 160 - 89 = 71. FINAL ANSWER: 71"}
