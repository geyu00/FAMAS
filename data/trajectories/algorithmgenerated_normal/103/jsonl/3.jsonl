{"agent": "Location-Based_Services_Expert", "content": "It appears there was an issue with accessing the Bing Search API due to an invalid subscription key. Since we cannot proceed with that approach, I can utilize my expertise to manually find the coordinates of Harkness Memorial State Park.\n\nHarkness Memorial State Park is located in Waterford, Connecticut. The approximate coordinates are:\n- Latitude: 41.3143\n- Longitude: -72.2059\n\nNext, I will use these coordinates to search for nearby eateries. I'll suggest a code snippet to query a location-based service (such as Google Maps) to find eateries close to these coordinates that are open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\nLet's use Python and the Google Maps API to find eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park. I will provide a script for this purpose:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Google Maps API\nAPI_KEY = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY'\nlocation = \"41.3143,-72.2059\"  # Harkness Memorial State Park coordinates\nradius = 5000  # Search within a 5km radius\ntype_of_place = \"restaurant\"  # Looking for eateries\n\nsearch_url = f\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?location={location}&radius={radius}&type={type_of_place}&key={API_KEY}\"\n\nresponse = requests.get(search_url)\nresponse_json = response.json()\nprint(response_json)\n```\n\nThis script will search for eateries within a 5 km radius of Harkness Memorial State Park. I will run it now using the coordinates obtained. If you have a Google Maps API key available, please provide it, or if not, I can proceed without actual execution, and we can validate based on expected results."}

Here’s what we can do:\n\n1. I can suggest searching for nearby eateries manually using popular websites or apps like Google Maps, Yelp, or TripAdvisor.\n2. If we have access to another location-based service or a different method to identify the eateries, we can use that as an alternative.\n\nLet’s gather information about eateries in the area and check their operating hours to find out if any of them are open at 11 PM on Wednesdays. \n\nShall we proceed with gathering manual data from an external source, or do you have an API key we could use?"}
