{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question pertains to the C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The question asks which of these C-suite members did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The current C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The date of monday.com's IPO.\n   - The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of the IPO.\n   - These facts can be found on monday.com’s official website, their SEC filings, press releases, and news articles covering the IPO.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Comparison of the current C-suite members with those who were in place during the IPO to identify any changes in positions.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that the CEO has been in the same position since before the IPO, but this needs verification.\n   - Other C-suite positions, such as CFO or COO, might have changed, but this is speculative without specific data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Conduct a web search to find the current C-suite members of monday.com.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for the date of monday.com's IPO.\n- **WebSurfer**: Find the C-suite members of monday.com at the time of the IPO.\n- **Assistant**: Compare the current C-suite members with those from the IPO period to identify any changes.\n- **Assistant**: Compile the findings and determine which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question pertains to the C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The question asks which of these C-suite members did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The IPO date of monday.com was June 14, 2021.\n   - The current C-suite members of monday.com are:\n     - Roy Mann: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eran Zinman: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eliran Glazer: CFO\n     - Shiran Nawi: Chief People and Legal Officer\n     - Daniel Lereya: Chief Product and Technology Officer\n     - Casey George: Chief Revenue Officer (joined in May 2025)\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of the IPO (June 14, 2021).\n   - Specific roles and responsibilities of the C-suite members during the IPO.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Comparison of the current C-suite members with those who were in place during the IPO to identify any changes in positions.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Roy Mann and Eran Zinman**: Given that they are co-founders and co-CEOs, it is highly likely that they held C-suite positions (specifically Co-CEO roles) during the IPO. This is supported by their long-standing roles in the company.\n   - **Eliran Glazer**: As the CFO, it is plausible that he was also in a C-suite position during the IPO, given the importance of financial leadership during such a significant event.\n   - **Shiran Nawi**: Her role as Chief People and Legal Officer suggests she might have been in a senior position during the IPO, but it is less certain whether she was in a C-suite role at that time.\n   - **Daniel Lereya**: As the Chief Product and Technology Officer, it is reasonable to assume he was in a senior technical leadership role during the IPO, but it is unclear if he was in a C-suite position.\n   - **Casey George**: Since Casey George joined as Chief Revenue Officer in May 2025, it is clear that he did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO in June 2021.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses**:\n- **Co-Founders (Roy Mann and Eran Zinman)**: Founders often hold key leadership positions from the early stages of a company, making it highly likely they were in C-suite roles during the IPO.\n- **CFO (Eliran Glazer)**: The CFO is a critical role during an IPO, so it is reasonable to assume he was in a C-suite position.\n- **Chief People and Legal Officer (Shiran Nawi)**: While important, the role of Chief People and Legal Officer might not have been a C-suite position at the time of the IPO, but this needs verification.\n- **Chief Product and Technology Officer (Daniel Lereya)**: Similar to the CFO, the CPTO is a crucial role, but it is less certain if he was in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n- **Chief Revenue Officer (Casey George)**: His recent appointment in 2025 clearly indicates he did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO in 2021.\n\nThis updated fact sheet should help guide further research and verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Rate Limiting on SEC.gov**: The attempt to access SEC filings directly from SEC.gov resulted in rate limiting, preventing us from retrieving the necessary information.\n2. **Inefficient Search Strategy**: The search queries were too broad and did not focus on specific, reliable sources that could provide the required information.\n3. **Lack of Direct Access to IPO Documents**: We did not directly access the IPO prospectus or S-1 filing, which are the most authoritative sources for C-suite information at the time of the IPO.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific search terms to find the IPO prospectus or S-1 filing for monday.com.\n   - Example search terms: \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\" or \"monday.com IPO prospectus June 14, 2021\".\n\n2. **Access IPO Documents**:\n   - Navigate to the official SEC Edgar database and search for monday.com's S-1 filing or IPO prospectus.\n   - Use the CIK (Central Index Key) if available to streamline the search.\n\n3. **Review Press Releases**:\n   - Search for press releases from around the IPO date (June 14, 2021) that list the C-suite members.\n   - Focus on official company press releases and reputable financial news sources.\n\n4. **Summarize and Compare**:\n   - Once the C-suite members at the time of the IPO are identified, compare them with the current C-suite members.\n   - Identify any changes in positions and determine which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\" and \"monday.com IPO prospectus June 14, 2021\".\n2. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the SEC Edgar database and search for monday.com's S-1 filing using the company name and IPO date.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Review the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus to extract the list of C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Search for press releases from around June 14, 2021, that list the C-suite members.\n5. **Assistant**: Compare the C-suite members from the IPO with the current C-suite members.\n6. **Assistant**: Identify and compile the findings to determine which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with any new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question pertains to the C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The question asks which of these C-suite members did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The IPO date of monday.com was June 14, 2021.\n   - The current C-suite members of monday.com are:\n     - Roy Mann: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eran Zinman: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eliran Glazer: CFO\n     - Shiran Nawi: Chief People and Legal Officer\n     - Daniel Lereya: Chief Product and Technology Officer\n     - Casey George: Chief Revenue Officer (joined in May 2025)\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of the IPO (June 14, 2021).\n   - Specific roles and responsibilities of the C-suite members during the IPO.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Comparison of the current C-suite members with those who were in place during the IPO to identify any changes in positions.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Roy Mann and Eran Zinman**: Given that they are co-founders and co-CEOs, it is highly likely that they held C-suite positions (specifically Co-CEO roles) during the IPO. This is supported by their long-standing roles in the company.\n   - **Eliran Glazer**: As the CFO, it is plausible that he was also in a C-suite position during the IPO, given the importance of financial leadership during such a significant event.\n   - **Shiran Nawi**: Her role as Chief People and Legal Officer suggests she might have been in a senior position during the IPO, but it is less certain whether she was in a C-suite role at that time. However, given the importance of legal and HR functions, it is reasonable to hypothesize that she might have been in a C-suite role.\n   - **Daniel Lereya**: As the Chief Product and Technology Officer, it is reasonable to assume he was in a senior technical leadership role during the IPO, but it is unclear if he was in a C-suite position. Given the importance of product and technology in a tech company, it is possible he was in a C-suite role.\n   - **Casey George**: Since Casey George joined as Chief Revenue Officer in May 2025, it is clear that he did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO in June 2021.\n\n### Additional Educated Guesses and Reasoning\n\n- **Shiran Nawi**: While her role as Chief People and Legal Officer is crucial, it is less common for such roles to be part of the C-suite in smaller or mid-sized companies. However, given the rapid growth and significance of monday.com, it is possible that she was elevated to a C-suite position before or during the IPO. This needs verification from the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus.\n- **Daniel Lereya**: The role of Chief Product and Technology Officer is typically a C-suite position, especially in a tech company. Given the importance of product development and technology in monday.com's business model, it is likely that he was in a C-suite role during the IPO. However, this also needs verification from the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\" and navigate to a reliable source that provides the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Once the document is found, review it to extract the list of C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n3. **Assistant**: Compare the C-suite members from the IPO with the current C-suite members.\n4. **Assistant**: Identify and compile the findings to determine which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to gather the necessary information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Rate Limiting on SEC.gov**: The repeated attempts to access SEC filings directly from SEC.gov resulted in rate limiting, preventing us from retrieving the necessary information.\n2. **Inefficient Search Strategy**: The search queries were too broad and did not focus on specific, reliable sources that could provide the required information.\n3. **Lack of Direct Access to IPO Documents**: We did not directly access the IPO prospectus or S-1 filing, which are the most authoritative sources for C-suite information at the time of the IPO.\n4. **Timeout Errors**: The web surfing process encountered timeout errors, possibly due to slow page loading or network issues.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific search terms to find the IPO prospectus or S-1 filing for monday.com.\n   - Example search terms: \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\" or \"monday.com IPO prospectus June 14, 2021\".\n\n2. **Access IPO Documents via Alternative Sources**:\n   - Use Google or another search engine to search for \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\".\n   - Navigate to the official SEC Edgar database and search for monday.com's S-1 filing using the company name and IPO date.\n   - Use the CIK (Central Index Key) if available to streamline the search.\n\n3. **Review Press Releases**:\n   - Search for press releases from around the IPO date (June 14, 2021) that list the C-suite members.\n   - Focus on official company press releases and reputable financial news sources.\n\n4. **Summarize and Compare**:\n   - Once the C-suite members at the time of the IPO are identified, compare them with the current C-suite members.\n   - Identify any changes in positions and determine which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\" using Google or another search engine.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Click on the first reliable link that appears to be the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus for monday.com.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the document to find the section that lists the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n4. **WebSurfer**: If the document is not immediately accessible, navigate to the SEC Edgar database and search for monday.com's S-1 filing using the company name and IPO date.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Review the S-1 filing to extract the list of C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n6. **WebSurfer**: Search for press releases from around June 14, 2021, that list the C-suite members.\n7. **Assistant**: Compare the C-suite members from the IPO with the current C-suite members.\n8. **Assistant**: Identify and compile the findings to determine which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with any new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question pertains to the C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The question asks which of these C-suite members did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The IPO date of monday.com was June 14, 2021.\n   - The current C-suite members of monday.com are:\n     - Roy Mann: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eran Zinman: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eliran Glazer: CFO\n     - Shiran Nawi: Chief People and Legal Officer\n     - Daniel Lereya: Chief Product and Technology Officer\n     - Casey George: Chief Revenue Officer (joined in May 2025)\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of the IPO (June 14, 2021).\n   - Specific roles and responsibilities of the C-suite members during the IPO.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Comparison of the current C-suite members with those who were in place during the IPO to identify any changes in positions.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Roy Mann and Eran Zinman**: Given that they are co-founders and co-CEOs, it is highly likely that they held C-suite positions (specifically Co-CEO roles) during the IPO. This is supported by their long-standing roles in the company.\n   - **Eliran Glazer**: As the CFO, it is plausible that he was also in a C-suite position during the IPO, given the importance of financial leadership during such a significant event.\n   - **Shiran Nawi**: Her role as Chief People and Legal Officer suggests she might have been in a senior position during the IPO, but it is less certain whether she was in a C-suite role at that time. However, given the importance of legal and HR functions, it is reasonable to hypothesize that she might have been in a C-suite role.\n   - **Daniel Lereya**: As the Chief Product and Technology Officer, it is reasonable to assume he was in a senior technical leadership role during the IPO, but it is unclear if he was in a C-suite position. Given the importance of product and technology in a tech company, it is possible he was in a C-suite role.\n   - **Casey George**: Since Casey George joined as Chief Revenue Officer in May 2025, it is clear that he did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO in June 2021.\n\n### Additional Educated Guesses and Reasoning\n\n- **Shiran Nawi**: While her role as Chief People and Legal Officer is crucial, it is less common for such roles to be part of the C-suite in smaller or mid-sized companies. However, given the rapid growth and significance of monday.com, it is possible that she was elevated to a C-suite position before or during the IPO. This needs verification from the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus.\n- **Daniel Lereya**: The role of Chief Product and Technology Officer is typically a C-suite position, especially in a tech company. Given the importance of product development and technology in monday.com's business model, it is likely that he was in a C-suite role during the IPO. However, this also needs verification from the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus.\n\n### Updated Next Steps\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\" using Google or another search engine.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Click on the first reliable link that appears to be the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus for monday.com.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the document to find the section that lists the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n4. **WebSurfer**: If the document is not immediately accessible, navigate to the SEC Edgar database and search for monday.com's S-1 filing using the company name and IPO date.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Review the S-1 filing to extract the list of C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n6. **WebSurfer**: Search for press releases from around June 14, 2021, that list the C-suite members.\n7. **Assistant**: Compare the C-suite members from the IPO with the current C-suite members.\n8. **Assistant**: Identify and compile the findings to determine which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### New Hunches and Reasoning\n\n- **Alternative Sources**: Given the rate limiting issues on SEC.gov, it might be more effective to look for the S-1 filing on alternative financial news websites or official company press releases. These sources often provide detailed information about the company's leadership structure at the time of the IPO.\n- **Press Releases**: Official company press releases from the time of the IPO are likely to contain accurate and detailed information about the C-suite members. These documents are usually well-maintained and can be a reliable source of information.\n\nLet's proceed with the updated plan to gather the necessary information.\n\n### Action Item\n\nWebSurfer, please perform a web search for \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\" using Google or another search engine. Focus on finding official company press releases or reputable financial news sources that provide the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus. Once you find a reliable source, navigate to the document and locate the section that lists the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Rate Limiting on SEC.gov**: Repeated attempts to access SEC filings directly from SEC.gov resulted in rate limiting, preventing us from retrieving the necessary information.\n2. **Inefficient Search Strategy**: The search queries were too broad and did not focus on specific, reliable sources that could provide the required information.\n3. **Lack of Direct Access to IPO Documents**: We did not directly access the IPO prospectus or S-1 filing, which are the most authoritative sources for C-suite information at the time of the IPO.\n4. **Timeout Errors**: The web surfing process encountered timeout errors, possibly due to slow page loading or network issues.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific search terms to find the IPO prospectus or S-1 filing for monday.com.\n   - Example search terms: \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\" or \"monday.com IPO prospectus June 14, 2021\".\n\n2. **Access IPO Documents via Alternative Sources**:\n   - Use Google or another search engine to search for \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\".\n   - Navigate to the official SEC Edgar database and search for monday.com's S-1 filing using the company name and IPO date.\n   - Use the CIK (Central Index Key) if available to streamline the search.\n\n3. **Review Press Releases**:\n   - Search for press releases from around the IPO date (June 14, 2021) that list the C-suite members.\n   - Focus on official company press releases and reputable financial news sources.\n\n4. **Summarize and Compare**:\n   - Once the C-suite members at the time of the IPO are identified, compare them with the current C-suite members.\n   - Identify any changes in positions and determine which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\" using Google or another search engine.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Click on the first reliable link that appears to be the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus for monday.com.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the document to find the section that lists the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n4. **WebSurfer**: If the document is not immediately accessible, navigate to the SEC Edgar database and search for monday.com's S-1 filing using the company name and IPO date.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Review the S-1 filing to extract the list of C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n6. **WebSurfer**: Search for press releases from around June 14, 2021, that list the C-suite members.\n7. **Assistant**: Compare the C-suite members from the IPO with the current C-suite members.\n8. **Assistant**: Identify and compile the findings to determine which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Additional Hints\n\n- **Use Google Scholar or Financial News Aggregators**: Sometimes, financial news aggregators like Bloomberg, Reuters, or CNBC have archived copies of S-1 filings and press releases.\n- **Check Company Website**: The investor relations section of monday.com's website might have historical documents and press releases related to the IPO.\n- **Avoid Rate Limiting**: Space out requests to avoid hitting rate limits on SEC.gov or other websites. Use the `sleep` function to introduce delays between requests if necessary.\n\n### Action Item\n\nWebSurfer, please perform a web search for \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\" using Google or another search engine. Focus on finding official company press releases or reputable financial news sources that provide the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus. Once you find a reliable source, navigate to the document and locate the section that lists the C-suite members at the time of the IPO."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with any new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question pertains to the C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The question asks which of these C-suite members did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The IPO date of monday.com was June 14, 2021.\n   - The current C-suite members of monday.com are:\n     - Roy Mann: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eran Zinman: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eliran Glazer: CFO\n     - Shiran Nawi: Chief People and Legal Officer\n     - Daniel Lereya: Chief Product and Technology Officer\n     - Casey George: Chief Revenue Officer (joined in May 2025)\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of the IPO (June 14, 2021).\n   - Specific roles and responsibilities of the C-suite members during the IPO.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Comparison of the current C-suite members with those who were in place during the IPO to identify any changes in positions.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Roy Mann and Eran Zinman**: Given that they are co-founders and co-CEOs, it is highly likely that they held C-suite positions (specifically Co-CEO roles) during the IPO. This is supported by their long-standing roles in the company.\n   - **Eliran Glazer**: As the CFO, it is plausible that he was also in a C-suite position during the IPO, given the importance of financial leadership during such a significant event.\n   - **Shiran Nawi**: Her role as Chief People and Legal Officer suggests she might have been in a senior position during the IPO, but it is less certain whether she was in a C-suite role at that time. However, given the importance of legal and HR functions, it is reasonable to hypothesize that she might have been in a C-suite role.\n   - **Daniel Lereya**: As the Chief Product and Technology Officer, it is reasonable to assume he was in a senior technical leadership role during the IPO, but it is unclear if he was in a C-suite position. Given the importance of product and technology in a tech company, it is possible he was in a C-suite role.\n   - **Casey George**: Since Casey George joined as Chief Revenue Officer in May 2025, it is clear that he did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO in June 2021.\n\n### Additional Educated Guesses and Reasoning\n\n- **Shiran Nawi**: While her role as Chief People and Legal Officer is crucial, it is less common for such roles to be part of the C-suite in smaller or mid-sized companies. However, given the rapid growth and significance of monday.com, it is possible that she was elevated to a C-suite position before or during the IPO. This needs verification from the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus.\n- **Daniel Lereya**: The role of Chief Product and Technology Officer is typically a C-suite position, especially in a tech company. Given the importance of product development and technology in monday.com's business model, it is likely that he was in a C-suite role during the IPO. However, this also needs verification from the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus.\n\n### Updated Next Steps\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\" using Google or another search engine.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Click on the first reliable link that appears to be the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus for monday.com.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the document to find the section that lists the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n4. **WebSurfer**: If the document is not immediately accessible, navigate to the SEC Edgar database and search for monday.com's S-1 filing using the company name and IPO date.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Review the S-1 filing to extract the list of C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n6. **WebSurfer**: Search for press releases from around June 14, 2021, that list the C-suite members.\n7. **Assistant**: Compare the C-suite members from the IPO with the current C-suite members.\n8. **Assistant**: Identify and compile the findings to determine which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### New Hunches and Reasoning\n\n- **Alternative Sources**: Given the rate limiting issues on SEC.gov, it might be more effective to look for the S-1 filing on alternative financial news websites or official company press releases. These sources often provide detailed information about the company's leadership structure at the time of the IPO.\n- **Press Releases**: Official company press releases from the time of the IPO are likely to contain accurate and detailed information about the C-suite members. These documents are usually well-maintained and can be a reliable source of information.\n\n### Action Item\n\nWebSurfer, please perform a web search for \"monday.com S-1 filing June 14, 2021\" using Google or another search engine. Focus on finding official company press releases or reputable financial news sources that provide the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus. Once you find a reliable source, navigate to the document and locate the section that lists the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Repetitive Search Attempts**: We repeatedly performed the same search query without varying the approach, leading to redundant results and no new information.\n2. **Lack of Specificity**: The search queries were not specific enough to directly lead to the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus.\n3. **Rate Limiting and Network Issues**: Multiple attempts to access SEC.gov led to rate limiting, preventing us from retrieving the necessary information.\n4. **Inefficient Use of Resources**: We did not effectively utilize the WebSurfer to navigate through different types of sources (e.g., financial news sites, company press releases).\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific search terms to find the IPO prospectus or S-1 filing for monday.com.\n   - Example search terms: \"monday.com S-1 filing PDF June 14, 2021\" or \"monday.com IPO prospectus PDF June 14, 2021\".\n\n2. **Access IPO Documents via Alternative Sources**:\n   - Use Google to search for \"monday.com S-1 filing PDF June 14, 2021\".\n   - Navigate to the official SEC Edgar database and search for monday.com's S-1 filing using the company name and IPO date.\n   - Use the CIK (Central Index Key) if available to streamline the search.\n\n3. **Review Press Releases**:\n   - Search for press releases from around the IPO date (June 14, 2021) that list the C-suite members.\n   - Focus on official company press releases and reputable financial news sources.\n\n4. **Summarize and Compare**:\n   - Once the C-suite members at the time of the IPO are identified, compare them with the current C-suite members.\n   - Identify any changes in positions and determine which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"monday.com S-1 filing PDF June 14, 2021\" using Google.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Click on the first reliable link that appears to be the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus for monday.com.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the document to find the section that lists the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n4. **WebSurfer**: If the document is not immediately accessible, navigate to the SEC Edgar database and search for monday.com's S-1 filing using the company name and IPO date.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Review the S-1 filing to extract the list of C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n6. **WebSurfer**: Search for press releases from around June 14, 2021, that list the C-suite members.\n7. **Assistant**: Compare the C-suite members from the IPO with the current C-suite members.\n8. **Assistant**: Identify and compile the findings to determine which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Additional Hints\n\n- **Use Google Scholar or Financial News Aggregators**: Sometimes, financial news aggregators like Bloomberg, Reuters, or CNBC have archived copies of S-1 filings and press releases.\n- **Check Company Website**: The investor relations section of monday.com's website might have historical documents and press releases related to the IPO.\n- **Avoid Rate Limiting**: Space out requests to avoid hitting rate limits on SEC.gov or other websites. Use the `sleep` function to introduce delays between requests if necessary.\n\n### Action Item\n\nWebSurfer, please perform a web search for \"monday.com S-1 filing PDF June 14, 2021\" using Google. Focus on finding official company press releases or reputable financial news sources that provide the S-1 filing or IPO prospectus. Once you find a reliable source, navigate to the document and locate the section that lists the C-suite members at the time of the IPO."}
