{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich members of Fubo's Management Team joined the company during the same year Fubo's IPO happened?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request asks about members of Fubo's Management Team who joined the company during the same year as Fubo's IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The year Fubo went public (IPO year).\n   - The names and joining years of the current members of Fubo's Management Team.\n   - These facts can be found on Fubo's official website, SEC filings, press releases, and possibly corporate biographies or LinkedIn profiles of the management team members.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the joining years of the management team members with the year of Fubo's IPO to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Fubo's IPO likely occurred in the last few years, given the company's growth and market presence.\n   - Some key executives often join around the time of an IPO to support the transition to a publicly traded company.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to find the year Fubo went public (IPO year) by searching for official press releases or financial news articles.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to navigate to Fubo's official website and locate the section detailing the management team, including their names and joining years.\n- **Step 3:** If the official website does not provide joining years, use WebSurfer to search for additional sources such as SEC filings, press releases, and LinkedIn profiles of the management team members.\n- **Step 4:** Cross-reference the joining years of the management team members with the IPO year to identify those who joined in the same year.\n- **Step 5:** Compile the results and provide a list of the management team members who joined Fubo during the IPO year."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich members of Fubo's Management Team joined the company during the same year Fubo's IPO happened?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request asks about members of Fubo's Management Team who joined the company during the same year as Fubo's IPO.\n   - Fubo's IPO occurred on October 13, 2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The names and joining years of the current members of Fubo's Management Team.\n   - These facts can be found on Fubo's official website, SEC filings, press releases, and possibly corporate biographies or LinkedIn profiles of the management team members.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the joining years of the management team members with the year of Fubo's IPO (2020) to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that Fubo's IPO occurred in 2020, it is likely that some key executives joined the company around that time to support the transition to a publicly traded company.\n   - Key roles such as CFO, COO, and other C-suite positions often see changes or additions around the time of an IPO to ensure the company is well-prepared for the scrutiny and responsibilities of being a public entity.\n   - Specific names and joining years of the management team members can be found in SEC filings, particularly in the annual reports (10-K) and proxy statements (DEF 14A).\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- **SEC Filings**: The most reliable source for the joining years of the management team will be the SEC filings, specifically the DEF 14A proxy statements and 10-K annual reports.\n- **LinkedIn Profiles**: LinkedIn profiles of the management team members can also provide valuable information about their career history and joining dates.\n- **Press Releases**: Press releases from 2020 might contain announcements of new hires or promotions that coincide with the IPO.\n\nBy focusing on these sources, we should be able to gather the necessary information to complete the task.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Cloudflare Blocking**: When attempting to access the management team section on Fubo's investor relations page, the browser was blocked by Cloudflare's security service. This prevented us from directly accessing the information on the official website.\n- **Inefficient Search Strategy**: The search queries used to find the joining years of the management team were too broad and did not yield specific results. We need to refine our search to focus on specific documents and sources that are likely to contain the required information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to search for Fubo's 2020 DEF 14A proxy statement and 10-K annual report. These documents are likely to contain detailed information about the management team, including their joining years.\n  - **Hint**: Use specific search terms like \"Fubo 2020 DEF 14A\" and \"Fubo 2020 10-K\" to find the exact documents.\n- **Step 2**: Once the relevant documents are found, use WebSurfer to open and navigate through the documents to locate the sections detailing the management team and their joining years.\n  - **Hint**: Look for sections titled \"Executive Officers,\" \"Management,\" or \"Board of Directors.\"\n- **Step 3**: Extract the names and joining years of the management team members from the documents.\n- **Step 4**: Cross-reference the joining years with the IPO year (2020) to identify those who joined in the same year.\n- **Step 5**: Compile the results and provide a list of the management team members who joined Fubo during the IPO year.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to search for Fubo's 2020 DEF 14A proxy statement and 10-K annual report.\n  - **Action**: Perform a web search using the terms \"Fubo 2020 DEF 14A\" and \"Fubo 2020 10-K.\"\n\n- **Step 2**: Open the relevant documents.\n  - **Action**: Click on the links to the 2020 DEF 14A and 10-K documents.\n\n- **Step 3**: Navigate through the documents to find the management team information.\n  - **Action**: Scroll through the documents and look for sections titled \"Executive Officers,\" \"Management,\" or \"Board of Directors.\"\n\n- **Step 4**: Extract the names and joining years of the management team members.\n  - **Action**: Note down the names and joining years of each management team member.\n\n- **Step 5**: Cross-reference the joining years with the IPO year (2020).\n  - **Action**: Identify and list the management team members who joined in 2020.\n\n- **Step 6**: Compile the results.\n  - **Action**: Provide a final list of the management team members who joined Fubo during the IPO year.\n\nBy focusing on specific and reliable sources like SEC filings, we can avoid the issues encountered with Cloudflare blocking and inefficient search strategies."}

The headquarters and ﬁnance operations of the Company’s principal\noperating subsidiary are located in France. Local health authorities in France have enacted stringent restrictions designed to minimize risk to exposure to\nCOVID-19 that have resulted in the mandatory conﬁnement of people to their homes, subject to limited exceptions. In addition, due to travel restrictions\nimposed by the governments of the United States and France in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company’s U.S. based independent auditor\nwas unable to travel to France to perform the site visits needed to complete the audit of the Company’s ﬁnancial statements for the ﬁscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2019. These restrictions have prevented the Company’s personnel and auditors from accessing the oﬃces of the Company’s subsidiary in\nFrance.  All  of  the  foregoing  slowed  the  accounting  and  auditing  work  required  to  compile  and  audit  the  Company’s  ﬁnancial  statements  for  the  year\nended December 31, 2019 to be included in the Annual Report. Based on the foregoing, on March 31, 2020, the Company ﬁled the 8-K to avail itself of a\n45-day  extension  to  ﬁle  this  Annual  Report  relying  on  the  exemptions  provided  by  the  SEC  Order.
