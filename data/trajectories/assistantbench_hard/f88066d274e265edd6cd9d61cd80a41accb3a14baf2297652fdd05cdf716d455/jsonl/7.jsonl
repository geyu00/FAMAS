Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress we have made so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park.\n   - Trails must have more than 1,000 reviews on TripAdvisor.\n   - Trails must be recommended to be fully accessible to wheelchairs by at least three different people.\n   - Trails must be highly rated (4.5/5 or more on average).\n   - The Mist Trail has 1,057 reviews and a 4.8/5 rating on TripAdvisor.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific names of popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park.\n   - Number of reviews for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n   - Average ratings (out of 5 stars) for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n   - Recommendations regarding wheelchair accessibility for each trail.\n   - Sources: TripAdvisor, official Yosemite National Park website, accessible travel guides, and user reviews.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which trails meet all the criteria (more than 1,000 reviews, 4.5/5 or higher rating, and at least three recommendations for wheelchair accessibility).\n   - Cross-referencing data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Popular trails like the Lower Yosemite Falls Trail and the Bridalveil Fall Trail might meet the criteria, given their well-known accessibility and popularity.\n   - Trails with fewer reviews or lower ratings are unlikely to meet the criteria.\n   - Trails that are frequently mentioned in accessible travel guides are more likely to be fully accessible to wheelchairs.\n   - The Mist Trail, despite its high rating and review count, may not be fully accessible to wheelchairs due to its moderate to strenuous difficulty and steep sections. However, we need to verify this with user reviews and official sources.\n   - The Lower Yosemite Falls Trail and the Bridalveil Fall Trail are likely to be more accessible due to their easier difficulty levels and flatter terrain.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n1. **Step 1: Identify Popular Hiking Trails to Waterfalls in Yosemite National Park**\n   -
