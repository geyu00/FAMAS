Thomas, in a 1964 paper published in the journal \"Nature.\" Their study focused on the oils released by plants during dry periods and how they contribute to the earthy scent after rain.\n\nNow that we have identified the word and its origin, we can proceed to the next step, where the Quotation Specialist can determine the writer quoted regarding \"petrichor.\""}
