{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when Regression was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The source for this information is GitHub.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when Regression was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue with the Regression label.\n   - This information can be found on the GitHub repository for NumPy, specifically in the issues section.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact date when the Regression label was added to the issue, which may require examining the issue's history or comments.\n   - Determining which closed issue is the oldest among those labeled with Regression.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The oldest closed issue with the Regression label is likely to have been closed some time ago, possibly several years back, given the age of the NumPy project.\n   - The date format MM/DD/YY suggests that the date will be presented in a common American format.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the GitHub repository for NumPy.**\n- **Use WebSurfer to navigate to the NumPy GitHub issues page.**\n- **Filter the issues to show only those labeled with \"Regression\" and are closed.**\n- **Sort the filtered issues by the oldest creation date.**\n- **Examine the oldest closed issue with the Regression label to find when the Regression label was added.**\n- **If the label addition date is not directly visible, use the issue's history or comments to determine the date.**\n- **Format the date in MM/DD/YY and provide the final answer.**"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and adjustments:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed `numpy.polynomial` issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The source for this information is GitHub.\n   - The search query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression numpy.polynomial` did not return any results, indicating that there might be no issues specifically labeled with both \"Regression\" and \"numpy.polynomial\" in the exact form searched.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue related to `numpy.polynomial` that has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - This information can be found on the GitHub repository for NumPy, specifically in the issues section.\n   - We need to broaden the search to all closed issues with the \"Regression\" label and manually check for issues related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the issue, which may require examining the issue's history or comments.\n   - Determining which closed issue is the oldest among those labeled with \"Regression\" and related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is likely to have been closed some time ago, possibly several years back, given the age of the NumPy project.\n   - The date format MM/DD/YY suggests that the date will be presented in a common American format.\n   - Since the specific search query did not return any results, it is possible that the term \"numpy.polynomial\" is not used consistently in the issue titles or descriptions. Therefore, we should manually review the oldest closed issues labeled with \"Regression\" to identify any that are related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The lack of results from the specific search query suggests that the term \"numpy.polynomial\" might not be used in a way that matches the search criteria. This could be due to variations in how the term is referenced or the scope of the issues.\n- Manually reviewing the oldest closed issues labeled with \"Regression\" will help ensure that we do not miss any relevant issues, even if they are not explicitly labeled with \"numpy.polynomial.\"\n- Given the age of the NumPy project, it is reasonable to expect that older issues might contain valuable information, and the \"Regression\" label could have been added at different times.\n\nNext steps:\n- Navigate to the list of closed issues labeled with \"Regression\" and sort them by the oldest creation date.\n- Manually review the oldest issues to identify any that are related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- Once the relevant issue is identified, examine its history to find the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Specific Search Query Issue**: The search query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression numpy.polynomial` did not return any results, likely because the term \"numpy.polynomial\" is not consistently used in the issue titles or labels.\n- **Manual Review Needed**: The search filters were too specific, and a broader approach is needed to manually review the oldest closed issues labeled with \"Regression\" to identify any that are related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the List of Closed Issues with the Regression Label**:\n   - Use the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression`.\n   - Sort the issues by the oldest creation date.\n\n2. **Manually Review the Oldest Issues**:\n   - Scroll through the list of issues and identify the oldest closed issues.\n   - For each issue, check the title and description to see if it is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Issue**:\n   - Once an issue related to `numpy.polynomial` is found, note the issue number and title.\n\n4. **Examine the Issue History**:\n   - Click on the identified issue to open it.\n   - Check the timeline or comments to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n5. **Extract the Date**:\n   - Note the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n   - Format the date in MM/DD/YY.\n\n6. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Report the date in the required format.\n\n### Steps for WebSurfer\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression`.\n- **Step 2**: Sort the issues by the oldest creation date.\n- **Step 3**: Scroll through the list and identify the oldest closed issues.\n- **Step 4**: For each issue, check the title and description to see if it is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Step 5**: Once an issue related to `numpy.polynomial` is found, click on the issue to open it.\n- **Step 6**: Check the timeline or comments to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Step 7**: Note the date and format it in MM/DD/YY.\n- **Step 8**: Provide the final answer.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Broaden the Search**: Instead of using a very specific search query, use a broader filter and manually review the results.\n- **Check Issue Details**: Pay close attention to the issue titles and descriptions to identify relevance to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Examine Issue History**: Look for the \"Regression\" label in the issue timeline or comments to find the exact date it was added.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. Please navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression` and sort the issues by the oldest creation date.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and adjustments:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about finding the date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed `numpy.polynomial` issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n- The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n- The source for this information is GitHub.\n- The search query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression numpy.polynomial` did not return any results, indicating that there might be no issues specifically labeled with both \"Regression\" and \"numpy.polynomial\" in the exact form searched.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue related to `numpy.polynomial` that has the \"Regression\" label.\n- This information can be found on the GitHub repository for NumPy, specifically in the issues section.\n- We need to broaden the search to all closed issues with the \"Regression\" label and manually check for issues related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the issue, which may require examining the issue's history or comments.\n- Determining which closed issue is the oldest among those labeled with \"Regression\" and related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is likely to have been closed some time ago, possibly several years back, given the age of the NumPy project.\n- The date format MM/DD/YY suggests that the date will be presented in a common American format.\n- Since the specific search query did not return any results, it is possible that the term \"numpy.polynomial\" is not used consistently in the issue titles or descriptions. Therefore, we should manually review the oldest closed issues labeled with \"Regression\" to identify any that are related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- The term \"polynomial\" might be used in a broader context within the issues, such as in the body of the issue or in comments, rather than just in the title or labels.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- The lack of results from the specific search query suggests that the term \"numpy.polynomial\" might not be used in a way that matches the search criteria. This could be due to variations in how the term is referenced or the scope of the issues.\n- Manually reviewing the oldest closed issues labeled with \"Regression\" will help ensure that we do not miss any relevant issues, even if they are not explicitly labeled with \"numpy.polynomial.\"\n- Given the age of the NumPy project, it is reasonable to expect that older issues might contain valuable information, and the \"Regression\" label could have been added at different times.\n- The term \"polynomial\" might appear in the issue body or comments, so a more thorough manual review is necessary.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the List of Closed Issues with the Regression Label**:\n   - Use the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression`.\n   - Sort the issues by the oldest creation date.\n\n2. **Manually Review the Oldest Issues**:\n   - Scroll through the list of issues and identify the oldest closed issues.\n   - For each issue, check the title, description, and comments to see if it is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Issue**:\n   - Once an issue related to `numpy.polynomial` is found, note the issue number and title.\n\n4. **Examine the Issue History**:\n   - Click on the identified issue to open it.\n   - Check the timeline or comments to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n5. **Extract the Date**:\n   - Note the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n   - Format the date in MM/DD/YY.\n\n6. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Report the date in the required format.\n\n### Steps for WebSurfer\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression`.\n- **Step 2**: Sort the issues by the oldest creation date.\n- **Step 3**: Scroll through the list and identify the oldest closed issues.\n- **Step 4**: For each issue, check the title, description, and comments to see if it is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Step 5**: Once an issue related to `numpy.polynomial` is found, click on the issue to open it.\n- **Step 6**: Check the timeline or comments to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Step 7**: Note the date and format it in MM/DD/YY.\n- **Step 8**: Provide the final answer.\n\nPlease proceed with the next steps. Navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression`, sort the issues by the oldest creation date, and start reviewing the oldest issues to find one related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Specific Search Query Issue**: The search query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression numpy.polynomial` did not return any results, likely because the term \"numpy.polynomial\" is not consistently used in the issue titles or labels.\n- **Manual Review Needed**: The search filters were too specific, and a broader approach is needed to manually review the oldest closed issues labeled with \"Regression\" to identify any that are related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Inadequate Scrolling and Review**: The previous attempts involved scrolling through the list but did not thoroughly check the issues for relevance to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the List of Closed Issues with the Regression Label**:\n   - Use the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression`.\n   - Sort the issues by the oldest creation date.\n\n2. **Manually Review the Oldest Issues**:\n   - Scroll through the list of issues and identify the oldest closed issues.\n   - For each issue, check the title, description, and comments to see if it is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Issue**:\n   - Once an issue related to `numpy.polynomial` is found, note the issue number and title.\n\n4. **Examine the Issue History**:\n   - Click on the identified issue to open it.\n   - Check the timeline or comments to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n5. **Extract the Date**:\n   - Note the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n   - Format the date in MM/DD/YY.\n\n6. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Report the date in the required format.\n\n### Steps for WebSurfer\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression`.\n- **Step 2**: Sort the issues by the oldest creation date.\n- **Step 3**: Scroll through the list and identify the oldest closed issues.\n- **Step 4**: For each issue, check the title, description, and comments to see if it is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Step 5**: Once an issue related to `numpy.polynomial` is found, click on the issue to open it.\n- **Step 6**: Check the timeline or comments to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Step 7**: Note the date and format it in MM/DD/YY.\n- **Step 8**: Provide the final answer.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Broaden the Search**: Instead of using a very specific search query, use a broader filter and manually review the results.\n- **Check Issue Details Thoroughly**: Pay close attention to the issue titles, descriptions, and comments to identify relevance to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Examine Issue History**: Look for the \"Regression\" label in the issue timeline or comments to find the exact date it was added.\n- **Be Patient and Thorough**: Ensure that each issue is reviewed carefully to avoid missing relevant information.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan. Navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression`, sort the issues by the oldest creation date, and start reviewing the oldest issues to find one related to `numpy.polynomial`."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and adjustments:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about finding the date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed `numpy.polynomial` issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n- The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n- The source for this information is GitHub.\n- The search query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression numpy.polynomial` did not return any results, indicating that there might be no issues specifically labeled with both \"Regression\" and \"numpy.polynomial\" in the exact form searched.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue related to `numpy.polynomial` that has the \"Regression\" label.\n- This information can be found on the GitHub repository for NumPy, specifically in the issues section.\n- We need to broaden the search to all closed issues with the \"Regression\" label and manually check for issues related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the issue, which may require examining the issue's history or comments.\n- Determining which closed issue is the oldest among those labeled with \"Regression\" and related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is likely to have been closed some time ago, possibly several years back, given the age of the NumPy project.\n- The date format MM/DD/YY suggests that the date will be presented in a common American format.\n- Since the specific search query did not return any results, it is possible that the term \"numpy.polynomial\" is not used consistently in the issue titles or descriptions. Therefore, we should manually review the oldest closed issues labeled with \"Regression\" to identify any that are related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- The term \"polynomial\" might be used in a broader context within the issues, such as in the body of the issue or in comments, rather than just in the title or labels.\n- Some issues might be related to `numpy.polynomial` but not explicitly labeled as such, so a thorough review of the issue content is necessary.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- The lack of results from the specific search query suggests that the term \"numpy.polynomial\" might not be used in a way that matches the search criteria. This could be due to variations in how the term is referenced or the scope of the issues.\n- Manually reviewing the oldest closed issues labeled with \"Regression\" will help ensure that we do not miss any relevant issues, even if they are not explicitly labeled with \"numpy.polynomial.\"\n- Given the age of the NumPy project, it is reasonable to expect that older issues might contain valuable information, and the \"Regression\" label could have been added at different times.\n- The term \"polynomial\" might appear in the issue body or comments, so a more thorough manual review is necessary.\n- Some issues might be related to `numpy.polynomial` but not explicitly labeled as such, requiring a careful examination of the issue content.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the List of Closed Issues with the Regression Label**:\n   - Use the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression`.\n   - Sort the issues by the oldest creation date.\n\n2. **Manually Review the Oldest Issues**:\n   - Scroll through the list of issues and identify the oldest closed issues.\n   - For each issue, check the title, description, and comments to see if it is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Issue**:\n   - Once an issue related to `numpy.polynomial` is found, note the issue number and title.\n\n4. **Examine the Issue History**:\n   - Click on the identified issue to open it.\n   - Check the timeline or comments to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n5. **Extract the Date**:\n   - Note the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n   - Format the date in MM/DD/YY.\n\n6. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Report the date in the required format.\n\n### Steps for WebSurfer\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression`.\n- **Step 2**: Sort the issues by the oldest creation date.\n- **Step 3**: Scroll through the list and identify the oldest closed issues.\n- **Step 4**: For each issue, check the title, description, and comments to see if it is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Step 5**: Once an issue related to `numpy.polynomial` is found, click on the issue to open it.\n- **Step 6**: Check the timeline or comments to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Step 7**: Note the date and format it in MM/DD/YY.\n- **Step 8**: Provide the final answer.\n\nPlease proceed with the next steps. Navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression`, sort the issues by the oldest creation date, and start reviewing the oldest issues to find one related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Specific Search Query Issue**: The search query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression numpy.polynomial` did not return any results, likely because the term \"numpy.polynomial\" is not consistently used in the issue titles or labels.\n- **Manual Review Needed**: The search filters were too specific, and a broader approach is needed to manually review the oldest closed issues labeled with \"Regression\" to identify any that are related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Inadequate Scrolling and Review**: The previous attempts involved scrolling through the list but did not thoroughly check the issues for relevance to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the List of Closed Issues with the Regression Label**:\n   - Use the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression`.\n   - Sort the issues by the oldest creation date.\n\n2. **Manually Review the Oldest Issues**:\n   - Scroll through the list of issues and identify the oldest closed issues.\n   - For each issue, check the title, description, and comments to see if it is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Issue**:\n   - Once an issue related to `numpy.polynomial` is found, note the issue number and title.\n\n4. **Examine the Issue History**:\n   - Click on the identified issue to open it.\n   - Check the timeline or comments to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n5. **Extract the Date**:\n   - Note the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n   - Format the date in MM/DD/YY.\n\n6. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Report the date in the required format.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Broaden the Search**: Instead of using a very specific search query, use a broader filter and manually review the results.\n- **Check Issue Details Thoroughly**: Pay close attention to the issue titles, descriptions, and comments to identify relevance to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Examine Issue History**: Look for the \"Regression\" label in the issue timeline or comments to find the exact date it was added.\n- **Be Patient and Thorough**: Ensure that each issue is reviewed carefully to avoid missing relevant information.\n\n### Steps for WebSurfer\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression`.\n- **Step 2**: Sort the issues by the oldest creation date.\n- **Step 3**: Scroll through the list and identify the oldest closed issues.\n- **Step 4**: For each issue, check the title, description, and comments to see if it is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Step 5**: Once an issue related to `numpy.polynomial` is found, click on the issue to open it.\n- **Step 6**: Check the timeline or comments to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Step 7**: Note the date and format it in MM/DD/YY.\n- **Step 8**: Provide the final answer.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan.
