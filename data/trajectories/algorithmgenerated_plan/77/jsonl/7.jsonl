{"agent": "YouTubeDownload_Expert", "content": "It seems that the download attempt failed due to a couple of reasons:\n\n1. **Python Version Deprecation**: `yt-dlp` is warning that the version of Python in use (3.7) is deprecated. It is recommended to use Python 3.8 or above for the best compatibility and performance.\n  \n2. **Sign-in Requirement**: The error indicates that YouTube is requiring a sign-in to confirm that we're not a bot, which can happen with certain videos or under certain conditions.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo move forward, we have two options:\n1. **Upgrade Python**: Update the Python version to 3.8 or above, then reinstall `yt-dlp`, and attempt the download again.\n2. **Use Cookies for Authentication**: If upgrading Python isn't immediately feasible, we can try using cookies from a logged-in session to bypass the sign-in requirement. \n\nWhich approach would you prefer? If upgrading is feasible, we can do that first. Otherwise, I can provide instructions for using cookies."}
