It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The desired time for martial arts classes is between 7-9 pm.\n   - The context is after work.\n   - The exact address of the New York Stock Exchange is 11 Wall Street, New York City.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of martial arts schools or gyms within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The class schedules for these martial arts schools or gyms, specifically for the 7-9 pm time slot.\n   - Reviews or ratings of the martial arts schools or gyms to ensure quality.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The walking radius of a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The availability of evening classes at the identified martial arts schools or gyms during the specified time.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely several fitness centers and martial arts studios in the Financial District area due to its high density of office buildings and workers.\n   - Some popular martial arts styles that might be offered in the area could include Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, and Krav Maga, given their popularity in urban settings.\n   - Given the proximity to Wall Street, the facilities are likely to be modern and well-equipped.\n   - The Renzo Gracie Academy, located at 224 W 30th St, New York, is a well-known martial arts school, but it is not within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange. Therefore, it is unlikely to be a suitable option for the user's needs.\n   - Other martial arts schools in the Financial District, such as Champions Martial Arts Brooklyn Heights (151 Montague St, Brooklyn) and Fontanez Martial Arts Success Center (188 E 3rd St, New York), should be investigated further to determine their proximity and class schedules.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Renzo Gracie Academy**: While it is a reputable school, its location at 224 W 30th St is quite far from the New York Stock Exchange, making it impractical for the user's requirement of a five-minute walk.\n- **Champions Martial Arts Brooklyn Heights and Fontanez Martial Arts Success Center**: These schools are closer to the Financial District and should be checked for their proximity and class schedules to see if they meet the user's criteria.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Verify the exact walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to Champions Martial Arts Brooklyn Heights and Fontanez Martial Arts Success Center.\n2. Check the class schedules of these schools to see if they offer classes between 7-9 PM on weekdays.\n3. Look for any reviews or ratings to ensure the quality of these martial arts schools.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Navigation**: The web navigation steps were not optimized, leading to repeated scrolling and failing to reach the class schedule section efficiently.\n2. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were too general, causing it to miss the critical information needed.\n3. **Verification of Proximity**: The proximity of the martial arts schools to the New York Stock Exchange was not verified early enough, leading to wasted time on schools that were not within the required walking distance.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Verify Proximity Early**:\n   - Use a mapping service (e.g., Google Maps) to verify the walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange (11 Wall Street) to the identified martial arts schools.\n   - Ensure the schools are within a five-minute walking distance before proceeding to check their class schedules.\n\n2. **Optimize Web Navigation**:\n   - Provide specific instructions to the WebSurfer to directly navigate to the class schedule section of each martial arts school's website.\n   - Use the search functionality on the website if available to quickly find the class schedule.\n\n3. **Check Class Schedules**:\n   - For each school within the five-minute walking distance, check the class schedules for classes between 7-9 PM on weekdays.\n   - Note the types of classes offered and any relevant details.\n\n4. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - Compile the information into a clear and concise report, including the names and addresses of the martial arts schools, the types of classes offered, and the specific times of the classes.\n   - Include any additional relevant information such as reviews or ratings if available.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Verify Proximity**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to open Google Maps and search for the walking distance from 11 Wall Street to:\n     - Champions Martial Arts Brooklyn Heights (151 Montague St, Brooklyn)\n     - Fontanez Martial Arts Success Center (188 E 3rd St, New York)\n\n2. **Check Class Schedules**:\n   - For each school within the five-minute walking distance:\n     - **Champions Martial Arts Brooklyn Heights**:\n       - Navigate to the website: `https://championsmartialartsbrooklynheights.com/`\n       - Use the search function or navigate to the class schedule section.\n       - Check for classes between 7-9 PM on weekdays.\n     - **Fontanez Martial Arts Success Center**:\n       - Navigate to the website: `https://fontanezmartialarts.com/`\n       - Use the search function or navigate to the class schedule section.\n       - Check for classes between 7-9 PM on weekdays.\n\n3. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - Compile the information into a report format:\n     - **School Name**: [Name]\n     - **Address**: [Address]\n     - **Classes Offered**: [List of classes]\n     - **Class Times**: [Specific times between 7-9 PM]\n     - **Reviews/Ratings**: [Any available reviews or ratings]\n\n### Example Script for WebSurfer\n\n```python\n# Verify walking distance using Google Maps\nweb_surfer.navigate(\"https://www.google.com/maps\")\nweb_surfer.search(\"walking distance from 11 Wall Street to 151 Montague St, Brooklyn\")\nweb_surfer.sleep(5)  # Wait for the page to load\ndistance_brooklyn = web_surfer.extract_text(\"Walking distance\")\n\nweb_surfer.navigate(\"https://www.google.com/maps\")\nweb_surfer.search(\"walking distance from 11 Wall Street to 188 E 3rd St, New York\")\nweb_surfer.sleep(5)  # Wait for the page to load\ndistance_nyc = web_surfer.extract_text(\"Walking distance\")\n\n# Check class schedules\nif \"5 minutes\" in distance_brooklyn:\n    web_surfer.navigate(\"https://championsmartialartsbrooklynheights.com/\")\n    web_surfer.search(\"class schedule\")\n    web_surfer.sleep(5)  # Wait for the page to load\n    class_schedule_brooklyn = web_surfer.extract_text(\"class schedule\")\n\nif \"5 minutes\" in distance_nyc:\n    web_surfer.navigate(\"https://fontanezmartialarts.com/\")\n    web_surfer.search(\"class schedule\")\n    web_surfer.sleep(5)  # Wait for the page to load\n    class_schedule_nyc = web_surfer.extract_text(\"class schedule\")\n\n# Summarize findings\nfindings = {\n    \"Champions Martial Arts Brooklyn Heights\": {\n        \"Address\": \"151 Montague St, Brooklyn\",\n        \"Distance\": distance_brooklyn,\n        \"Class Schedule\": class_schedule_brooklyn\n    },\n    \"Fontanez Martial Arts Success Center\": {\n        \"Address\": \"188 E 3rd St, New York\",\n        \"Distance\": distance_nyc,\n        \"Class Schedule\": class_schedule_nyc\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis plan ensures that we verify the proximity early, optimize web navigation, and efficiently check class schedules to avoid repeating the same mistakes."}
