{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request asks for the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n   - The source to check is Google Finance.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) to determine the first year it exceeded $50.\n   - This information can be found on Google Finance by looking at the historical price chart or downloading historical price data.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50, which would require analyzing the historical price data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock price has been volatile over the years, but it is likely that the stock first exceeded $50 sometime in the early 2000s, given the company's growth during that period. However, this is just an educated guess and needs to be verified with actual data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Use Google Finance to find the historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL).\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the historical prices section and look for the first year the stock price exceeded $50.\n- **WebSurfer**: If the exact year is not immediately clear, use the search or filter options to pinpoint the specific date or year.\n- **WebSurfer**: Verify the findings and report back with the year and, if available, the exact date when the stock first exceeded $50."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request asks for the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n   - The source to check is Google Finance.\n   - We have accessed the historical prices section for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) to determine the first year it exceeded $50.\n   - This information can be found on Google Finance by looking at the historical price chart or downloading historical price data.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50, which would require analyzing the historical price data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock price has been volatile over the years, but it is likely that the stock first exceeded $50 sometime in the early 2000s, given the company's growth during that period. However, this is just an educated guess and needs to be verified with actual data.\n   - Given the historical data shown on the 5-year chart, it appears that Apple's stock price has been consistently above $50 for several years. To pinpoint the exact year, we need to zoom out further or use the search/filter options to find the earliest instance of the stock exceeding $50.\n\n**REASONING FOR UPDATED EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- The 5-year chart on Google Finance shows that Apple's stock price has been well above $50 for the past few years. This suggests that the first time the stock exceeded $50 likely occurred before the 5-year window displayed.\n- Zooming out to a longer time frame (e.g., 10 years or MAX) or using the search/filter options to find the exact date will help us narrow down the year more accurately.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetition of Actions**: The WebSurfer repeatedly clicked on the \"5Y\" button, which did not advance the process of finding the historical data.\n- **Lack of Specific Navigation**: The instructions did not specify how to navigate to the historical prices section, which is crucial for finding the required data.\n- **Inadequate Use of Search/Filter Options**: The WebSurfer did not use the search or filter options to find the specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Navigate to Historical Prices Section**:\n  - WebSurfer: Click on the \"Historical Data\" or \"Price History\" section for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance.\n  \n- **Adjust Time Frame**:\n  - WebSurfer: Set the time frame to \"MAX\" to view the longest available historical data.\n  \n- **Find the First Year Above $50**:\n  - WebSurfer: Scroll through the historical data or use the search/filter options to find the first year the stock price exceeded $50.\n  - WebSurfer: Verify the exact date or year when the stock first exceeded $50.\n  \n- **Report the Findings**:\n  - WebSurfer: Report back with the year and, if available, the exact date when the stock first exceeded $50.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the historical prices section for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance.\n  - **Action**: Click on \"Historical Data\" or \"Price History\" for Apple (AAPL).\n\n- **Step 2**: Adjust the time frame to \"MAX\".\n  - **Action**: Select the \"MAX\" option to view the longest available historical data.\n\n- **Step 3**: Find the first year the stock price exceeded $50.\n  - **Action**: Scroll through the historical data or use the search/filter options to find the first instance of the stock price exceeding $50.\n\n- **Step 4**: Verify the exact date or year.\n  - **Action**: Confirm the exact date or year when the stock first exceeded $50.\n\n- **Step 5**: Report the findings.\n  - **Action**: Provide the year and, if available, the exact date when the stock first exceeded $50.\n\nPlease proceed with these steps."}

Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request asks for the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n   - The source to check is Google Finance.\n   - We have accessed the main page for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance.\n   - The historical prices section for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance is accessible without signing in.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) to determine the first year it exceeded $50.\n   - This information can be found on Google Finance by looking at the historical price chart or downloading historical price data.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50, which would require analyzing the historical price data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock price has been volatile over the years, but it is likely that the stock first exceeded $50 sometime in the early 2000s, given the company's significant growth during that period. However, this is just an educated guess and needs to be verified with actual data.\n   - Given the historical data shown on the 5-year chart, it appears that Apple's stock price has been consistently above $50 for several years. To pinpoint the exact year, we need to zoom out further or use the search/filter options to find the earliest instance of the stock exceeding $50.\n   - Based on the company's growth trajectory and the availability of historical data, it is reasonable to assume that the stock price first exceeded $50 between 2000 and 2005. This period saw significant technological advancements and increased consumer adoption of Apple products.\n\n**REASONING FOR UPDATED EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- The 5-year chart on Google Finance shows that Apple's stock price has been well above $50 for the past few years, suggesting that the first time the stock exceeded $50 likely occurred before the 5-year window displayed.\n- Zooming out to a longer time frame (e.g., 10 years or MAX) or using the search/filter options to find the exact date will help us narrow down the year more accurately.\n- Apple's significant growth and technological advancements in the early 2000s, particularly with the introduction of the iPod in 2001, support the hypothesis that the stock price first exceeded $50 during this period.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to Historical Data Section**:\n   - Click on the 'Historical Data' or 'Price History' section for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance.\n   \n2. **Adjust Time Frame**:\n   - Set the time frame to 'MAX' to view the longest available historical data.\n   \n3. **Find the First Year Above $50**:\n   - Scroll through the historical data or use the search/filter options to find the first year the stock price exceeded $50.\n   - Verify the exact date or year when the stock first exceeded $50.\n   \n4. **Report the Findings**:\n   - Provide the year and, if available, the exact date when the stock first exceeded $50.\n\nPlease proceed with these steps to find the required information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetition of Actions**: The WebSurfer repeatedly clicked on the 'Follow' button, which led to a sign-in prompt, instead of navigating directly to the 'Historical Data' section.\n- **Lack of Specific Navigation Instructions**: The instructions did not explicitly guide the WebSurfer to avoid the 'Follow' button and directly access the 'Historical Data' section.\n- **Inadequate Use of Search/Filter Options**: The WebSurfer did not use the search or filter options to find the specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Navigate to Historical Data Section**:\n  - **Action**: Click on the 'Historical Data' or 'Price History' section for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance.\n  - **Hint**: Avoid clicking on the 'Follow' button or any other buttons that lead to a sign-in prompt.\n\n- **Adjust Time Frame**:\n  - **Action**: Set the time frame to 'MAX' to view the longest available historical data.\n  - **Hint**: Ensure the time frame is set to 'MAX' to see the full historical data.\n\n- **Find the First Year Above $50**:\n  - **Action**: Scroll through the historical data or use the search/filter options to find the first year the stock price exceeded $50.\n  - **Hint**: Look for the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50. Use the search or filter options if available to narrow down the results.\n\n- **Verify the Exact Date or Year**:\n  - **Action**: Confirm the exact date or year when the stock first exceeded $50.\n  - **Hint**: Double-check the data to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Report the Findings**:\n  - **Action**: Provide the year and, if available, the exact date when the stock first exceeded $50.\n  - **Hint**: Clearly state the findings to avoid any ambiguity.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the 'Historical Data' or 'Price History' section for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance.\n  - **Action**: Click on 'Historical Data' or 'Price History' for Apple (AAPL).\n  - **Hint**: Avoid clicking on the 'Follow' button or any other buttons that lead to a sign-in prompt.\n\n- **Step 2**: Adjust the time frame to 'MAX'.\n  - **Action**: Set the time frame to 'MAX' to view the longest available historical data.\n  - **Hint**: Ensure the time frame is set to 'MAX'.\n\n- **Step 3**: Find the first year the stock price exceeded $50.\n  - **Action**: Scroll through the historical data or use the search/filter options to find the first instance of the stock price exceeding $50.\n  - **Hint**: Look for the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n- **Step 4**: Verify the exact date or year.\n  - **Action**: Confirm the exact date or year when the stock first exceeded $50.\n  - **Hint**: Double-check the data to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Step 5**: Report the findings.\n  - **Action**: Provide the year and, if available, the exact date when the stock first exceeded $50.\n  - **Hint**: Clearly state the findings to avoid any ambiguity.\n\nPlease proceed with these steps to find the required information."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request asks for the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n   - The source to check is Google Finance.\n   - We have accessed the main page for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance.\n   - The historical prices section for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance is accessible without signing in.\n   - The time frame has been set to 'MAX' to view the longest available historical data.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) to determine the first year it exceeded $50.\n   - This information can be found on Google Finance by looking at the historical price chart or downloading historical price data.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50, which would require analyzing the historical price data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock price has been volatile over the years, but it is likely that the stock first exceeded $50 sometime in the early 2000s, given the company's significant growth during that period. However, this is just an educated guess and needs to be verified with actual data.\n   - Given the historical data shown on the 5-year chart, it appears that Apple's stock price has been consistently above $50 for several years. To pinpoint the exact year, we need to zoom out further or use the search/filter options to find the earliest instance of the stock exceeding $50.\n   - Based on the company's growth trajectory and the availability of historical data, it is reasonable to assume that the stock price first exceeded $50 between 2000 and 2005. This period saw significant technological advancements and increased consumer adoption of Apple products.\n   - The introduction of the iPod in 2001 and the subsequent success of the product likely contributed to a significant increase in the stock price around this time.\n\n**REASONING FOR UPDATED EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- The 5-year chart on Google Finance shows that Apple's stock price has been well above $50 for the past few years, suggesting that the first time the stock exceeded $50 likely occurred before the 5-year window displayed.\n- Zooming out to a longer time frame (e.g., 10 years or MAX) or using the search/filter options to find the exact date will help us narrow down the year more accurately.\n- Apple's significant growth and technological advancements in the early 2000s, particularly with the introduction of the iPod in 2001, support the hypothesis that the stock price first exceeded $50 during this period.\n- The historical data should show a clear trend of the stock price increasing around the time of major product launches and company milestones.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to Historical Data Section**:\n   - Click on the 'Historical Data' or 'Price History' section for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance.\n\n2. **Adjust Time Frame**:\n   - Set the time frame to 'MAX' to view the longest available historical data.\n\n3. **Find the First Year Above $50**:\n   - Scroll through the historical data or use the search/filter options to find the first year the stock price exceeded $50.\n   - Verify the exact date or year when the stock first exceeded $50.\n\n4. **Report the Findings**:\n   - Provide the year and, if available, the exact date when the stock first exceeded $50.\n\nPlease proceed with these steps to find the required information. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, let me know!\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: The WebSurfer clicked on 'search Compare to' instead of navigating to the 'Historical Data' section.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions were not specific enough to guide the WebSurfer to the correct section and avoid distractions.\n- **Inadequate Verification**: There was no verification step to ensure the WebSurfer was in the correct section before proceeding.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Navigate to Historical Data Section**:\n  - **Action**: Click on the 'Historical Data' or 'Price History' section for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance.\n  - **Hint**: Ensure the section is labeled 'Historical Data' or 'Price History' and avoid clicking on other sections like 'Compare to' or 'Search'.\n\n- **Adjust Time Frame**:\n  - **Action**: Set the time frame to 'MAX' to view the longest available historical data.\n  - **Hint**: Ensure the time frame is set to 'MAX' to see the full historical data.\n\n- **Find the First Year Above $50**:\n  - **Action**: Scroll through the historical data or use the search/filter options to find the first year the stock price exceeded $50.\n  - **Hint**: Look for the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50. Use the search or filter options if available to narrow down the results.\n\n- **Verify the Exact Date or Year**:\n  - **Action**: Confirm the exact date or year when the stock first exceeded $50.\n  - **Hint**: Double-check the data to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Report the Findings**:\n  - **Action**: Provide the year and, if available, the exact date when the stock first exceeded $50.\n  - **Hint**: Clearly state the findings to avoid any ambiguity.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the 'Historical Data' or 'Price History' section for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance.\n  - **Action**: Click on 'Historical Data' or 'Price History' for Apple (AAPL).\n  - **Hint**: Ensure the section is labeled 'Historical Data' or 'Price History' and avoid clicking on other sections.\n\n- **Step 2**: Adjust the time frame to 'MAX'.\n  - **Action**: Set the time frame to 'MAX' to view the longest available historical data.\n  - **Hint**: Ensure the time frame is set to 'MAX'.\n\n- **Step 3**: Find the first year the stock price exceeded $50.\n  - **Action**: Scroll through the historical data or use the search/filter options to find the first instance of the stock price exceeding $50.\n  - **Hint**: Look for the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n- **Step 4**: Verify the exact date or year.\n  - **Action**: Confirm the exact date or year when the stock first exceeded $50.\n  - **Hint**: Double-check the data to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Step 5**: Report the findings.\n  - **Action**: Provide the year and, if available, the exact date when the stock first exceeded $50.\n  - **Hint**: Clearly state the findings to avoid any ambiguity.\n\nPlease proceed with these steps to find the required information."}

Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no,minimal-ui\",\n        \"google-site-verification\": \"sxp7zFOFUzk09RdlFhuH2SoCn5nOkXgomiLeLIQ48p0\",\n        \"mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"application-name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-title\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\": \"default\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"msapplication-tap-highlight\": \"no\",\n        \"description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_770x402.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"770\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"402\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary\",\n        \"twitter:site\": \"@google\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_496x496.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
