Unfortunately, it hasn't been shared in the messages. Please provide the code that is failing, as it is necessary for debugging the issue. \n\n### Step 2: Debug the Code\nOnce we have the code, I'll examine it for any syntax errors or logical mistakes that could lead to the exit code 1. Common culprits could include missing libraries, incorrect configurations, or usage of unsupported language features.\n\n### Step 3: Optimize the Code\nAfter identifying and resolving any errors, I will look for opportunities to optimize the code. This could include simplifying logic, improving performance, or ensuring better readability.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Successful Execution\nFinally, I will run the corrected and optimized code to verify that it executes without errors and produces the expected output.\n\nPlease provide the code you are currently working with so we can proceed with the debugging process."}
