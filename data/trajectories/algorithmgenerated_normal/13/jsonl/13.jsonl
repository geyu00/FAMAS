This exhibition was titled \"Chinese Zodiac: The Year of the Goat\". \n\n1. **Research the Exhibition**: The exhibition focused on the significance of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac and their representations in various forms of art. It included sculptures, paintings, and decorative art showcasing these animals.\n\n2. **Identify the Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac**: The twelve animals are:\n   - Rat\n   - Ox\n   - Tiger\n   - Rabbit\n   - Dragon\n   - Snake\n   - Horse\n   - Goat (or Sheep)\n   - Monkey\n   - Rooster\n   - Dog\n   - Pig\n\n3. **Analysis of the Exhibits**: Next, I will assess the artworks displayed in the exhibition, focusing specifically on representations of the zodiac animals and observing the visibility of hands in these artworks.\n\n   - I will gather information regarding which exhibits included the animals and whether their hands were depicted.\n\n4. **Verification of Findings**: Lastly, I will consolidate the findings and ensure their accuracy by cross-referencing the visual representations with catalog descriptions and exhibition reviews.\n\nNow, let's examine the artworks from the exhibition to identify how many zodiac animals have a hand visible. This will be done step by step to ensure thorough verification.\n\nI will now compile relevant information about the specific artworks and their representations. Please hold on while I gather the details."}
