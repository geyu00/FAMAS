Review the sample dataset and ensure it is representative of the real data.\n2. Verify the function used to find the smallest house and ensure it correctly filters and identifies the smallest house based on the specified criteria.\n\n## Output format\n- Confirmation of the dataset's representativeness\n- Verification of the function's correctness\n- Any identified issues or errors\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure the sample dataset is representative of the real data.\n- Ensure the function correctly identifies the smallest house based on the specified criteria."}
