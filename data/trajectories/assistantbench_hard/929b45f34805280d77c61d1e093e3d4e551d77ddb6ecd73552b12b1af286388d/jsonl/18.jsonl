Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the most relevant files as of May 2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The location or database where these files can be accessed (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl, or other genomic databases).\n   - Any updates or revisions to the dog genome between 2004 and May 2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact file names and formats of the most relevant dog genome data as of May 2020, which may require navigating through the database to identify the correct version.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files in May 2020 are likely to be part of a major update or release around that time, possibly from a well-known genomic resource like NCBI or Ensembl.\n   - The files are likely to be in standard genomic file formats such as FASTA, GFF, or VCF.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** WebSurfer to search for the most recent and relevant dog genome assembly as of May 2020.\n  - **Action:** Perform a web search using keywords like \"dog genome assembly 2020\" and \"Canis lupus familiaris genome May 2020.\"\n  - **Goal:** Identify the specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020 and the source database (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl).\n\n- **Step 2:** WebSurfer to navigate to the identified database and locate the specific files.\n  - **Action:** Visit the identified database (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl) and find the section for the dog genome assembly.\n  - **Goal:** Locate the download links for the most relevant files as of May 2020.\n\n- **Step 3:** WebSurfer to verify the file details and download links.\n  - **Action:** Inspect the file details (e.g., file format, size, release date) and ensure the links are correct.\n  - **Goal:** Confirm the accuracy of the file information and prepare to provide the download links.\n\n- **Step 4:** Assistant to compile and present the findings.\n  - **Action:** Summarize the information gathered, including the specific version of the dog genome assembly, the source database, and the download links.\n  - **Goal:** Provide a clear and concise response to the original request."}

The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.\nUnlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response (i.e. selection for tameness) and emotional processing.\nAssembly\nThe ROS_Cfam_1.0 assembly was submitted by The Roslin Institute on September 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 951 contigs assembled into 376 scaffolds. From these sequences, 40 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 12,024,593 while the scaffold N50 is 64,037,277.\nOther assemblies\nGene annotation\nThe gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.\nSmall ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold.\n Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of <10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.\n lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could be found in the transcript.\nDetailed information on dog genebuild (PDF)\nIn accordance with the \nFort Lauderdale Agreement, please check the publication status of the genome/assembly before publishing any genome-wide analyses using these data.\nMore information\nGeneral information about this species can be found in \nWikipedia. \nStatistics\nSummary\nAssemblyROS_Cfam_1.0, INSDC Assembly \nGCA_014441545.1, Sep 2020\nBase Pairs2,396,858,295\nGolden Path Length2,396,858,295\nAnnotation providerEnsembl\nAnnotation methodFull genebuild\nGenebuild startedOct 2020\nGenebuild releasedNov 2020\nGenebuild last updated/patchedOct 2020\nDatabase version114.1\nGene counts\nCoding genes20,567\nNon coding genes9,944\nSmall non coding genes3,437\nLong non coding genes6,485\nMisc non coding genes22\nPseudogenes610\nGene transcripts55,335\nOther\nGenscan gene predictions49,701\nShort Variants46,285,985\nStructural variants104,982\n.\nEnsembl release 114 - May 2025 © \nEMBL-EBIPermanent link - \nView in archive site.\nThis website requires cookies, and the limited processing of your personal data in order to function.
