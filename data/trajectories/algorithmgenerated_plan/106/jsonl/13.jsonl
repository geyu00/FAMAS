The data gathered is specific to **high-rise apartments**.\n2. All data is from the **year 2021**.\n\nTo further verify the accuracy of this highest price, I will check if there are any discrepancies in sale prices across the sites through additional data analysis and review if necessary.

I'll proceed to validate this information further. \n\nHowever, I currently lack access to live databases for additional verification, and since I can't run a data scrape from each of these sites here, I believe the data from Realtor.com should suffice. \n\nIf all members agree on this verification, we can conclude the investigation.
