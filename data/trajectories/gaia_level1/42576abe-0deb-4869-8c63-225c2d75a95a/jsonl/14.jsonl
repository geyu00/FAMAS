Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sentence structure in Tizin is Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n   - The word for oneself in Tizin: \n     - Nominative form: \"Pa\"\n     - Accusative form: \"Mato\"\n     - Genitive form: \"Sing\"\n   - The root verb for an intense like for something is \"Maktay\":\n     - Present tense: \"Maktay\"\n     - Preterit past: \"Tay\"\n     - Imperfect past: \"Aktay\"\n   - The verb \"Maktay\" translates better as \"is pleasing to\".\n   - The word for apples in Tizin:\n     - Nominative form: \"Apple\"\n     - Accusative form: \"Zapple\"\n     - Genitive form: \"Izapple\"\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - No specific facts need to be looked up as all necessary information is provided in the request.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The correct translation of \"I like apples\" into Tizin, considering the sentence structure and the given forms of the words and verb tenses.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the provided information, the sentence \"I like apples\" can be translated to Tizin as \"Maktay Zapple Pa\" (Verb + Direct Object + Subject). This assumes the present tense and the direct object form of \"apples\" and the nominative form of \"I\".\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Confirm the sentence structure and word forms provided in the request.\n- Construct the Tizin sentence \"I like apples\" using the given rules:\n  - Use \"Maktay\" for the present tense verb.\n  - Use \"Zapple\" for the accusative form of \"apples.\"\n  - Use \"Pa\" for the nominative form of \"I.\"\n- Arrange the words in the order Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n- Verify the constructed sentence against the provided rules to ensure accuracy.\n- Provide the final translation."}
