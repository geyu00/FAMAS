Express your answer in the 12-hour digital clock format without leading zero if any, and include whether it is AM or PM. Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nDetermine the time the Tri-Rail train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019, was scheduled to arrive in Pompano Beach. The answer should be expressed in the 12-hour digital clock format without leading zero if any, and include whether it is AM or PM.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The Data Analyst will analyze the passenger data for May 27, 2019, and identify the train with the highest number of passengers. Ensure the correct file path is verified before analysis.\n2. The Schedule Expert will provide the scheduled arrival times of the trains in Pompano Beach on May 27, 2019.\n3. The Verifier will verify the accuracy of the identified train and its arrival time.\n\n## Output format\nThe arrival time of the train in the format \"h:mm AM/PM\".\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The data must be accurate and specific to May 27, 2019.\n- The arrival time must be verified for correctness.\n\n## Results from last response\nThe task was not completed due to issues accessing the necessary data files (`passenger_data_may_27_2019.csv` and `train_schedule.csv`).
