What is the title of the oldest Blu-Ray recorded in this spreadsheet? Return it as appearing in the spreadsheet. Please solve the problem carefully.The attached file path is: ../2023/validation/32102e3e-d12a-4209-9163-7b3a104efe5d.xlsx.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nAnalyze the attached spreadsheet to identify the title of the oldest Blu-Ray recorded in the inventory. The title should be returned as it appears in the spreadsheet.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Load the spreadsheet and examine its structure.\n2. Identify the relevant columns that contain the Blu-Ray titles and their respective dates.\n3. Filter the records to include only Blu-Ray entries.\n4.
