Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - IMDB ratings for each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Runtime of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Availability of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Highest IMDB rating among the films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, so it is likely that one of her films meets the criteria.\n   - Some of her notable films include \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975), \"Possession\" (1981), and \"Camille Claudel\" (1988). These films are known for their critical acclaim, but their runtimes and availability on Fandango at Home need to be verified.\n   - Given the popularity of Isabelle Adjani and her critically acclaimed films, it is reasonable to assume that some of her films are available on major streaming platforms like Fandango at Home.\n   - \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) is a biographical drama and is likely to be less than 2 hours long, making it a strong candidate for our search.\n\n5. **ADDITIONAL STEPS TO TAKE**\n   - Navigate to IMDb and search for Isabelle Adjani's filmography, focusing on feature films.\n   - Filter the results to include only those with IMDB ratings and runtimes.\n   - Cross-reference the filtered list with Fandango at Home to check for availability.\n   - Identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step: navigating to IMDb and searching for Isabelle Adjani's filmography, focusing on feature films with IMDB ratings and runtimes.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Search Query**: The initial search query \"Isabelle Adjani feature films IMDB ratings runtimes\" did not yield the expected results because IMDb's search functionality does not directly support such a complex query.\n2. **Navigational Issues**: Navigating through IMDb's search results and filters was not done effectively, leading to incorrect pages being opened.\n3. **Lack of Specificity**: The search was too broad and did not focus on the specific criteria (feature films, IMDB ratings, runtimes, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to IMDb and Search for Isabelle Adjani**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to IMDb.\n   - Search for \"Isabelle Adjani\" to find her profile.\n\n2. **Access Isabelle Adjani's Filmography**:\n   - Click on Isabelle Adjani's name to access her profile.\n   - Navigate to her filmography section.\n\n3. **Filter Filmography for Feature Films**:\n   - Use the filters to select only feature films.\n   - Ensure the list includes IMDB ratings and runtimes.\n\n4. **Extract Relevant Information**:\n   - Extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of the feature films.\n   - Create a list of films that are less than 2 hours long.\n\n5. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - For each film in the filtered list, use WebSurfer to search for its availability on Fandango at Home.\n   - Verify if the film is available to buy or rent.\n\n6. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - From the list of films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home), identify the highest-rated film according to IMDB.\n\n7. **Verify and Confirm**:\n   - Double-check the runtime and availability of the highest-rated film to ensure accuracy.\n   - Provide the name of the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to go to IMDb and search for \"Isabelle Adjani\".\n- **Step 2**: Click on Isabelle Adjani's name to access her profile.\n- **Step 3**: Navigate to her filmography section and filter for feature films.\n- **Step 4**: Extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of the feature films.\n- **Step 5**: Create a list of films that are less than 2 hours long.\n- **Step 6**: Use WebSurfer to search for the availability of each film on Fandango at Home.\n- **Step 7**: Identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n- **Step 8**: Verify and confirm the final selection.\n\nLet's start by navigating to IMDb and searching for Isabelle Adjani."}

Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - IMDB ratings for each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Runtime of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Availability of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Highest IMDB rating among the films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, so it is likely that one of her films meets the criteria.\n   - Some of her notable films include \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975), \"Possession\" (1981), and \"Camille Claudel\" (1988). These films are known for their critical acclaim, but their runtimes and availability on Fandango at Home need to be verified.\n   - Given the popularity of Isabelle Adjani and her critically acclaimed films, it is reasonable to assume that some of her films are available on major streaming platforms like Fandango at Home.\n   - \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) is a biographical drama and is likely to be less than 2 hours long, making it a strong candidate for our search.\n   - \"Possession\" (1981) is another strong candidate due to its high IMDB rating and critical acclaim. However, its runtime needs to be verified.\n   - \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) is a highly rated film, but its runtime is longer than 2 hours, so it is unlikely to meet the criteria.\n\n5. **ADDITIONAL STEPS TO TAKE**\n   - Navigate to IMDb and search for Isabelle Adjani's filmography, focusing on feature films.\n   - Filter the results to include only those with IMDB ratings and runtimes.\n   - Cross-reference the filtered list with Fandango at Home to check for availability.\n   - Identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to IMDb and Search for Isabelle Adjani's Filmography**\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to IMDb.\n   - Search for \"Isabelle Adjani\" to find her profile.\n   - Click on Isabelle Adjani's name to access her profile.\n   - Navigate to her filmography section.\n\n2. **Filter Filmography for Feature Films**\n   - Use the filters to select only feature films.\n   - Ensure the list includes IMDB ratings and runtimes.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Information**\n   - Extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of the feature films.\n   - Create a list of films that are less than 2 hours long.\n\n4. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**\n   - For each film in the filtered list, use WebSurfer to search for its availability on Fandango at Home.\n   - Verify if the film is available to buy or rent.\n\n5. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**\n   - From the list of films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home), identify the highest-rated film according to IMDB.\n\n6. **Verify and Confirm**\n   - Double-check the runtime and availability of the highest-rated film to ensure accuracy.\n   - Provide the name of the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to go to IMDb and search for \"Isabelle Adjani\".\n- **Step 2**: Click on Isabelle Adjani's name to access her profile.\n- **Step 3**: Navigate to her filmography section and filter for feature films.\n- **Step 4**: Extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of the feature films.\n- **Step 5**: Create a list of films that are less than 2 hours long.\n- **Step 6**: Use WebSurfer to search for the availability of each film on Fandango at Home.\n- **Step 7**: Identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n- **Step 8**: Verify and confirm the final selection.\n\nLet's start by navigating to IMDb and searching for Isabelle Adjani's filmography, focusing on feature films with IMDB ratings and runtimes.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The previous attempts involved scrolling down the page multiple times without reaching the filmography section.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - IMDB ratings for each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Runtime of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Availability of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Highest IMDB rating among the films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, so it is likely that one of her films meets the criteria.\n   - Some of her notable films include \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975), \"Possession\" (1981), and \"Camille Claudel\" (1988). These films are known for their critical acclaim, but their runtimes and availability on Fandango at Home need to be verified.\n   - Given the popularity of Isabelle Adjani and her critically acclaimed films, it is reasonable to assume that some of her films are available on major streaming platforms like Fandango at Home.\n   - \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) is a biographical drama and is likely to be less than 2 hours long, making it a strong candidate for our search.\n   - \"Possession\" (1981) is another strong candidate due to its high IMDB rating and critical acclaim. However, its runtime needs to be verified.\n   - \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) is a highly rated film, but its runtime is longer than 2 hours, so it is unlikely to meet the criteria.\n   - **New Guess**: \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) is another critically acclaimed film starring Isabelle Adjani. It has a high IMDB rating and might be less than 2 hours long, making it a potential candidate. We should verify its runtime and availability on Fandango at Home.\n   - **Updated Guess**: \"One Deadly Summer\" (1983) is another highly rated film starring Isabelle Adjani. It is known for its critical acclaim and is likely to be less than 2 hours long.
