{"agent": "DataVerification_Expert", "content": "Based on the information provided in the task and the plan suggested by the manager, we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the starting and final percentages**:\n   - Starting percentage: 37%\n   - Change in percentage: 13%\n   - Final percentage after the change: 37% - 13% = 24%\n\n2. **Calculate the difference in percentage**:\n   - The difference is already provided as a change of 13%.\n\n3. **Determine the number of years**:\n   To find the number of years it took for this percentage change, we need to refer to the data provided by Girls Who Code. However, as I do not have direct access to this data, I will perform an online search to verify how long it took for the percentage of computer scientists that were women to decrease from 37% to 24%. \n\nLet's perform the search now using Bing Search API to extract the necessary information. \n\nI'll formulate the search query and execute it. \n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef search_girls_who_code():\n    query = \"how long did it take for percentage of women computer scientists to drop from 37% to 24% site:girlswhocode.com\"\n    headers = {\n        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': 'YOUR_BING_SEARCH_API_KEY',\n    }\n    response = requests.get(f\"https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search?q={query}\", headers=headers)\n    return response.json()\n\nsearch_result = search_girls_who_code()\nprint(search_result)\n``` \n\nPlease execute this code to find the relevant information."}

To resolve this, I'll change my approach by searching for the information manually without requiring the API. I will outline a plan to search for the necessary details about the historical change in the percentage of women computer scientists according to Girls Who Code.\n\n1. **Perform an online search** using the phrase \"percentage of women computer scientists change over time Girls Who Code.\"\n2. **Look for reliable sources**, such as articles, reports, or the official Girls Who Code website, which might detail the time frame for this percentage change.\n3. **Extract the relevant information** regarding the time it took for the percentage of women in computer science to drop from 37% to 24%.\n\nLet me summarize and check this information. I will proceed with this manual search and provide the results shortly."}
{"agent": "WomenInComputerScienceHistory_Expert", "content": "While DataVerification_Expert is conducting the manual search, I can share some historical context regarding the participation of women in computer science. \n\nIt has been observed that the percentage of women entering the field has fluctuated significantly over the decades. For instance, in the 1980s, women made up nearly 37% of the computer science workforce, but by the 2000s, this number had declined to about 24%. The reasons for this decline are often attributed to various social, educational, and economic factors, including stereotypes, workplace culture, and changes in the technology industry.\n\nI will wait for further information from DataVerification_Expert to better ascertain the timeline of this decline specifically as reported by Girls Who Code."}
{"agent": "DataVerification_Expert", "content": "Thank you for sharing that valuable historical context about the percentage of women in computer science. This helps to provide a clearer understanding of the fluctuations over the decades.\n\nNow that we have some context, I will verify the specific timeline related to the decrease from 37% to 24% based on the information provided by Girls Who Code. I will summarize my findings from the manual search regarding how long it took for this change to occur.\n\nI will check reputable sources and see if there's data available on the specific time frame in which the percentage of women in computer science fell from 37% to 24%. \n\nAfter reviewing the information, I will return with a verified timeline to complete the task. Please hold on for a moment."}
