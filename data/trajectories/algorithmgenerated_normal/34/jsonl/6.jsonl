{"agent": "Locomotive_Expert", "content": "The unique wheel configurations extracted from the data are as follows:\n\n- 0-4-0\n- 4-4-0\n- 2-6-0\n- 2-8-0\n- 2-6-4\n- 2-8-4\n- NW2\n- F3\n- PA\n- GP15\n- GP30\n- RDC\n- Brill\n- PCC\n- Handcar\n\nNow, we need to segregate the steam locomotives from this list. The configurations that follow the Whyte notation typically involve a combination of numbers that denote the arrangement of driving wheels, leading wheels, and trailing wheels. In our case, we can identify the steam locomotives by looking for configurations that fit the pattern of X-Y-Z (where X, Y, Z are integers).\n\nBased on this, the relevant steam locomotive configurations are:\n- 0-4-0\n- 4-4-0\n- 2-6-0\n- 2-8-0\n- 2-6-4\n- 2-8-4\n\nNext, I will calculate the total number of wheels for each of these steam locomotive configurations. The number of wheels for each configuration can be calculated as follows:\n\n- 0-4-0: 4 wheels\n- 4-4-0: 8 wheels\n- 2-6-0: 8 wheels\n- 2-8-0: 10 wheels\n- 2-6-4: 12 wheels\n- 2-8-4: 14 wheels\n\nNow, I will sum these total wheels. Here's the calculation code to execute:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of wheels for the identified steam locomotives\nsteam_loco_wheels = {\n    '0-4-0': 4,\n    '4-4-0': 8,\n    '2-6-0': 8,\n    '2-8-0': 10,\n    '2-6-4': 12,\n    '2-8-4': 14\n}\n\n# Sum the total wheels\ntotal_wheels = sum(steam_loco_wheels.values())\nprint(total_wheels)\n``` \n\nI will run this code now in the Computer_terminal."}

{"agent": "CSVProcessing_Expert", "content": "The total number of wheels for the listed steam locomotives is 56. \n\nNow, we need to verify the calculations to ensure the accuracy of this total. The calculations for each configuration were as follows:\n\n- 0-4-0: 4 wheels\n- 4-4-0: 8 wheels\n- 2-6-0: 8 wheels\n- 2-8-0: 10 wheels\n- 2-6-4: 12 wheels\n- 2-8-4: 14 wheels\n\nWhen we sum these:\n\n\\[ \n4 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 = 56 \n\\]\n\nThis confirms that our total of 56 wheels is accurate.\n\nSince we have followed the task requirements and verified the calculations successfully, we can conclude this conversation. \n\nTERMINATE"}
