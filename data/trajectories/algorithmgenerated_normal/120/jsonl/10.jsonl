{"agent": "Vegan_Food_Expert", "content": "I agree with the verification plan you've outlined. Here's how we can proceed to confirm the details for the identified restaurants:\n\n### 1. Confirm the Addresses\nWe need to check the addresses of each restaurant to ensure they are within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n\n### 2. Vegan Menu Items\nNext, we need to access each restaurant's current menu (either through their website or a reliable food review platform) to verify the vegan main dishes available and confirm that they are priced under $15.\n\n### 3. Non-Takeaway Status\nLastly, we will need to ensure that each of the identified restaurants offers dine-in services rather than being takeaway only.\n\nTo assist with this process, I can help run a check on the current menus if you have any specific resources or websites in mind. Otherwise, we can approach this by using reliable local guides or online reviews.\n\nLet's start by confirming the addresses and see if we can gather the menu information. I'll provide you with a basic structure to access the information quickly:\n\n```python\n# Pseudo code to check for vegan menu items under $15 and restaurant classification\ndef verify_restaurant_details(restaurant_list):\n    for restaurant in restaurant_list:\n        address = restaurant['address']\n        # Here we would implement the logic to scrape or access the menu online.\n        menu_items = fetch_menu(restaurant['name'])\n        vegan_items = [item for item in menu_items if item['is_vegan'] and item['price'] < 15]\n        if vegan_items:\n            print(f\"{restaurant['name']} has vegan options under $15.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{restaurant['name']} does not have vegan options under $15.\")\n```\n\nWe can discuss further steps after confirming the addresses. Would you like to use this structure to gather data, or do you have specific websites we should check first?"}
