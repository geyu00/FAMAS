{"agent": "NYC_Local_Expert", "content": "Let's start by identifying the exact location of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The NYSE is located at:\n\n**New York Stock Exchange**\nAddress: 11 Wall St, New York, NY 10005\n\nNext, I will search for martial arts schools within a five-minute walking distance from this location and check their schedules for classes available between 7-9 pm. \n\nI will compile a list of these schools and their relevant details. Please hold on while I perform this search. \n\n## Step 1: Identify martial arts schools within a five-minute walk. \n\nI will use the NYSE coordinates to find nearby schools. The coordinates for the NYSE are approximately (40.7074° N, 74.0113° W). A five-minute walk would cover a radius of roughly 0.25 miles. \n\nNow, I'll check for martial arts schools in this vicinity."}

{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "To ensure the information provided about the martial arts schools is accurate, I will verify the following aspects:\n\n1. **Walking Distance**: Confirm that each school's address is within approximately 0.25 miles from the New York Stock Exchange (11 Wall St, New York, NY 10005).\n\n2. **Class Schedules**: Verify the availability of classes between 7-9 pm as stated.\n\nLet's perform this verification step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Walking Distances\n- Calculate the distance from the NYSE to each martial arts school's address to confirm they are indeed within walking distance.\n- Use the coordinates provided earlier (40.7074° N, 74.0113° W) for the NYSE.\n\n### Step 2: Check Class Schedules\n- Verify whether the class schedules provided match the requirements for availability between 7-9 pm.\n\nI'll compile the necessary Python code to check the walking distances using the Haversine formula and verify the class schedules.
