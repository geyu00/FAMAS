{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location: Mission Bay, San Francisco.\n   - The year: 2021.\n   - The type of property: High-rise apartment.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n   - Sources to check:\n     - Real estate databases like Zillow, Redfin, or Realtor.com.\n     - Local real estate market reports from sources like the San Francisco Association of Realtors.\n     - News articles or press releases from reputable media outlets covering real estate transactions in San Francisco.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are necessary based on the given information. The primary task is to find the highest sale price, which is a straightforward data point.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge of the San Francisco real estate market, high-rise apartments in prime locations like Mission Bay can sell for several million dollars. However, without specific data, it's difficult to provide an exact figure.\n   - Given the high demand and luxury developments in Mission Bay, it's reasonable to guess that the highest sale price could be in the range of $5-10 million, but this is speculative.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nCertainly! Here’s a concise plan to address the original request:\n\n- **Step 1:** **WebSurfer** will perform a web search to find the highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n  - Search terms: \"highest price high-rise apartment sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\"\n  - Check sources such as real estate websites (Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com), local real estate market reports, and news articles.\n\n- **Step 2:** If the information is not readily available or if multiple sources need to be cross-referenced, **WebSurfer** will visit each relevant source and extract the necessary data.\n\n- **Step 3:** **WebSurfer** will compile the findings and provide the highest sale price along with the source(s) of the information.\n\n- **Step 4:** If additional verification is needed, **WebSurfer** will look for official real estate market reports or press releases from reputable organizations like the San Francisco Association of Realtors.\n\n- **Step 5:** **Assistant** will review the compiled information and format the final answer, ensuring accuracy and clarity.\n\nThis plan leverages the web searching and content extraction capabilities of WebSurfer to efficiently find the required information."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location: Mission Bay, San Francisco.\n   - The year: 2021.\n   - The type of property: High-rise apartment.\n   - A significant real estate transaction in Mission Bay in 2021 involved the sale of 1800 Owens Street, an office complex, for $1.08 billion, which is the second-highest price for a single property in San Francisco and the highest price per square foot in the city's history at $1,440 per square foot. (Source: [San Francisco YIMBY](https://sfyimby.com/2021/03/one-billion-dollars-for-1800-owens-street-in-mission-bay-san-francisco.html))\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n   - Sources to check:\n     - Real estate databases like Zillow, Redfin, or Realtor.com.\n     - Local real estate market reports from sources like the San Francisco Association of Realtors.\n     - News articles or press releases from reputable media outlets covering real estate transactions in San Francisco.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are necessary based on the given information. The primary task is to find the highest sale price, which is a straightforward data point.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the significant transaction of 1800 Owens Street, it is evident that the real estate market in Mission Bay, San Francisco, can support very high prices. While this transaction involves an office complex, it suggests that the overall market value in the area is robust.\n   - Given the high demand and luxury developments in Mission Bay, it is reasonable to guess that the highest sale price for a high-rise apartment in 2021 could be in the range of $5-10 million. This range is based on the general market conditions and the presence of luxury high-rise developments in the area.\n   - Another educated guess is that the highest sale price might be closer to the upper end of the $5-10 million range, considering the premium location and the luxury market in Mission Bay.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Perform a detailed search on Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com for recently sold high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n- Check local real estate market reports and news articles for any specific mentions of high-sale prices for high-rise apartments in the area during 2021.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Relevant Information Not Found**: Despite multiple searches, we did not find the specific information about the highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021. The searches often led to broader real estate transactions or unrelated high-value sales.\n2. **Narrowing Down the Search**: The search terms used were broad and did not specifically target high-rise apartments, leading to irrelevant results.\n3. **Source Verification**: The sources checked, while reputable, did not contain the exact data we were looking for, possibly due to the specificity of the query.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Terms**\n  - Use more specific search terms to target high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for the year 2021.\n  - Search terms: \"highest price high-rise apartment sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\" and \"most expensive high-rise condo sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\".\n\n- **Step 2: Visit Specific Real Estate Websites**\n  - Directly visit Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com and navigate to the \"Recently Sold\" section for Mission Bay, San Francisco.\n  - Filter the results to show only high-rise apartments and the year 2021.\n\n- **Step 3: Check Local Real Estate Reports**\n  - Visit the San Francisco Association of Realtors website and look for annual reports or market analyses for 2021.\n  - Search for any press releases or news articles from reputable sources that might mention high-value sales in Mission Bay.\n\n- **Step 4: Cross-Reference Multiple Sources**\n  - Compare the data found on real estate websites with local real estate reports and news articles to ensure accuracy.\n  - Note down the highest sale price and the source of the information.\n\n- **Step 5: Compile and Verify Information**\n  - Review the compiled information to ensure it is accurate and from reliable sources.\n  - Format the final answer clearly, including the highest sale price and the source.\n\n### Detailed Actions\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform the refined web search using the specified search terms.\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com, navigate to the \"Recently Sold\" section, and filter the results for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the San Francisco Association of Realtors website and look for relevant reports or press releases.\n- **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the data found and note the highest sale price and the source.\n- **Assistant**: Review and format the final answer.\n\n### Example Commands\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the following search terms: \"highest price high-rise apartment sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com, and navigate to the \"Recently Sold\" section for Mission Bay, San Francisco. Filter the results to show only high-rise apartments and the year 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the San Francisco Association of Realtors website and look for annual reports or market analyses for 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the data found and note the highest sale price and the source.\n- **Assistant**: Review and format the final answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location: Mission Bay, San Francisco.\n   - The year: 2021.\n   - The type of property: High-rise apartment.\n   - A significant real estate transaction in Mission Bay in 2021 involved the sale of 1800 Owens Street, an office complex, for $1.08 billion, which is the second-highest price for a single property in San Francisco and the highest price per square foot in the city's history at $1,440 per square foot. (Source: [San Francisco YIMBY](https://sfyimby.com/2021/03/one-billion-dollars-for-1800-owens-street-in-mission-bay-san-francisco.html))\n   - Initial searches on Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com for recently sold high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for 2021 have encountered technical issues or returned incomplete results.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n   - Sources to check:\n     - Real estate databases like Zillow, Redfin, or Realtor.com (once technical issues are resolved).\n     - Local real estate market reports from sources like the San Francisco Association of Realtors.\n     - News articles or press releases from reputable media outlets covering real estate transactions in San Francisco.\n     - Luxury real estate brokers and agents who specialize in Mission Bay.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are necessary based on the given information. The primary task is to find the highest sale price, which is a straightforward data point.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the significant transaction of 1800 Owens Street, it is evident that the real estate market in Mission Bay, San Francisco, can support very high prices. While this transaction involves an office complex, it suggests that the overall market value in the area is robust.\n   - Given the high demand and luxury developments in Mission Bay, it is reasonable to guess that the highest sale price for a high-rise apartment in 2021 could be in the range of $5-10 million. This range is based on the general market conditions and the presence of luxury high-rise developments in the area.\n   - Another educated guess is that the highest sale price might be closer to the upper end of the $5-10 million range, considering the premium location and the luxury market in Mission Bay.\n   - Additionally, given the technical issues encountered with major real estate websites, it is possible that the highest sale prices might be recorded in specialized luxury real estate reports or through direct inquiries to real estate agents and brokers.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Resolve Technical Issues**: Attempt to access Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com again to check for recently sold high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for 2021.\n- **Check Local Real Estate Reports**: Visit the San Francisco Association of Realtors website and look for annual reports or market analyses for 2021.\n- **Search News Articles**: Look for news articles or press releases from reputable sources that might mention high-value sales in Mission Bay.\n- **Contact Luxury Real Estate Brokers**: Reach out to luxury real estate brokers and agents who specialize in Mission Bay to gather more specific and detailed information about high-rise apartment sales in 2021.\n\n### Detailed Actions\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the following search terms: \"highest price high-rise apartment sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the San Francisco Association of Realtors website and look for annual reports or market analyses for 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for news articles or press releases from reputable media outlets covering real estate transactions in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Contact luxury real estate brokers and agents who specialize in Mission Bay to gather more specific and detailed information about high-rise apartment sales in 2021.\n- **Assistant**: Review and format the final answer once the information is gathered.\n\n### Example Commands\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the following search terms: \"highest price high-rise apartment sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the San Francisco Association of Realtors website and look for annual reports or market analyses for 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for news articles or press releases from reputable media outlets covering real estate transactions in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Contact luxury real estate brokers and agents who specialize in Mission Bay to gather more specific and detailed information about high-rise apartment sales in 2021.\n- **Assistant**: Review and format the final answer.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Technical Issues with Real Estate Websites**:\n   - Encountered CAPTCHAs and access blocks on Zillow and Realtor.com, preventing us from accessing the required data.\n   - Redfin also faced technical issues, showing an error message when attempting to navigate to the 'Recently Sold' section for Mission Bay, San Francisco.\n\n2. **Ineffective Search Terms**:\n   - The initial search terms used were too broad and did not specifically target high-rise apartments, leading to irrelevant results.\n\n3. **Lack of Diverse Sources**:\n   - Relied heavily on a few major real estate websites, which were not accessible due to technical issues. Did not explore alternative sources or methods.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Terms**:\n   - Use more specific search terms to target high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for the year 2021.\n   - Search terms: \"highest price high-rise apartment sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\", \"most expensive high-rise condo sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\".\n\n2. **Explore Alternative Real Estate Websites**:\n   - Try other real estate websites that might not have the same access restrictions, such as Trulia, Homes.com, or local real estate portals.\n   - Search for \"Trulia Mission Bay San Francisco recently sold 2021\" and \"Homes.com Mission Bay San Francisco recently sold 2021\".\n\n3. **Check Local Real Estate Reports**:\n   - Visit the San Francisco Association of Realtors website and look for annual reports or market analyses for 2021.\n   - Search for \"San Francisco Association of Realtors 2021 market report\".\n\n4. **Search News Articles and Press Releases**:\n   - Look for news articles or press releases from reputable media outlets covering real estate transactions in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for 2021.\n   - Search for \"highest price high-rise apartment sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 news\".\n\n5. **Contact Luxury Real Estate Brokers**:\n   - Identify and contact luxury real estate brokers and agents who specialize in Mission Bay to gather more specific and detailed information about high-rise apartment sales in 2021.\n   - Search for \"luxury real estate brokers Mission Bay San Francisco\" and send inquiries via their contact forms or email addresses.\n\n### Detailed Actions\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the following search terms: \"highest price high-rise apartment sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit Trulia and Homes.com, and navigate to the 'Recently Sold' section for Mission Bay, San Francisco. Filter the results to show only high-rise apartments and the year 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the San Francisco Association of Realtors website and look for annual reports or market analyses for 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for news articles or press releases from reputable media outlets covering real estate transactions in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Identify and contact luxury real estate brokers and agents who specialize in Mission Bay to gather more specific and detailed information about high-rise apartment sales in 2021.\n- **Assistant**: Review and format the final answer once the information is gathered."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location: Mission Bay, San Francisco.\n   - The year: 2021.\n   - The type of property: High-rise apartment.\n   - A significant real estate transaction in Mission Bay in 2021 involved the sale of 1800 Owens Street, an office complex, for $1.08 billion, which is the second-highest price for a single property in San Francisco and the highest price per square foot in the city's history at $1,440 per square foot. (Source: [San Francisco YIMBY](https://sfyimby.com/2021/03/one-billion-dollars-for-1800-owens-street-in-mission-bay-san-francisco.html))\n   - Initial searches on Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com for recently sold high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for 2021 have encountered technical issues or returned incomplete results.\n   - According to San Francisco Condo Mania, the final sale prices of high-rise apartments in the Radiance at Mission Bay complex ranged from $1,212,000 to $1,400,000 over the last 180 days. (Source: [San Francisco Condo Mania](https://www.sanfranciscocondomania.com/condos/RADIANCE-AT-MISSION-BAY.php))\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n   - Sources to check:\n     - Real estate databases like Zillow, Redfin, or Realtor.com (once technical issues are resolved).\n     - Local real estate market reports from sources like the San Francisco Association of Realtors.\n     - News articles or press releases from reputable media outlets covering real estate transactions in San Francisco.\n     - Luxury real estate brokers and agents who specialize in Mission Bay.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are necessary based on the given information. The primary task is to find the highest sale price, which is a straightforward data point.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the significant transaction of 1800 Owens Street, it is evident that the real estate market in Mission Bay, San Francisco, can support very high prices. While this transaction involves an office complex, it suggests that the overall market value in the area is robust.\n   - Given the high demand and luxury developments in Mission Bay, it is reasonable to guess that the highest sale price for a high-rise apartment in 2021 could be in the range of $5-10 million. This range is based on the general market conditions and the presence of luxury high-rise developments in the area.\n   - Another educated guess is that the highest sale price might be closer to the upper end of the $5-10 million range, considering the premium location and the luxury market in Mission Bay.\n   - Additionally, given the technical issues encountered with major real estate websites, it is possible that the highest sale prices might be recorded in specialized luxury real estate reports or through direct inquiries to real estate agents and brokers.\n   - Based on the data from San Francisco Condo Mania, while the highest sale price in the Radiance at Mission Bay complex was $1,400,000, it is likely that higher prices were achieved in other luxury developments in the area, given the overall market conditions.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Resolve Technical Issues**: Attempt to access Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com again to check for recently sold high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for 2021.\n- **Check Local Real Estate Reports**: Visit the San Francisco Association of Realtors website and look for annual reports or market analyses for 2021.\n- **Search News Articles**: Look for news articles or press releases from reputable sources that might mention high-value sales in Mission Bay.\n- **Contact Luxury Real Estate Brokers**: Reach out to luxury real estate brokers and agents who specialize in Mission Bay to gather more specific and detailed information about high-rise apartment sales in 2021.\n\n### Detailed Actions\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the following search terms: \"highest price high-rise apartment sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the San Francisco Association of Realtors website and look for annual reports or market analyses for 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for news articles or press releases from reputable media outlets covering real estate transactions in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Contact luxury real estate brokers and agents who specialize in Mission Bay to gather more specific and detailed information about high-rise apartment sales in 2021.\n- **Assistant**: Review and format the final answer once the information is gathered.\n\n### Example Commands\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the following search terms: \"highest price high-rise apartment sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the San Francisco Association of Realtors website and look for annual reports or market analyses for 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for news articles or press releases from reputable media outlets covering real estate transactions in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for 2021.\n- **WebSurfer**: Contact luxury real estate brokers and agents who specialize in Mission Bay to gather more specific and detailed information about high-rise apartment sales in 2021.\n- **Assistant**: Review and format the final answer.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses\n- The sale of 1800 Owens Street for $1.08 billion indicates a robust and high-value real estate market in Mission Bay.\n- The sale prices in the Radiance at Mission Bay complex provide a baseline, but it is reasonable to assume that other luxury developments in the area might have seen higher prices.\n- The luxury market in San Francisco, particularly in premium locations like Mission Bay, often sees high-value transactions that may not be widely publicized or easily accessible through standard real estate databases.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Technical Issues with Real Estate Websites**:\n   - Encountered CAPTCHAs and access blocks on Zillow and Realtor.com, preventing us from accessing the required data.\n   - Redfin also faced technical issues, showing an error message when attempting to navigate to the 'Recently Sold' section for Mission Bay, San Francisco.\n\n2. **Limited Search Scope**:\n   - Initial searches were too broad and did not specifically target high-rise apartments, leading to irrelevant results.\n   - Searches on the San Francisco Association of Realtors website and other specialized sites did not yield useful results.\n\n3. **Ineffective Search Terms**:\n   - The search terms used were not precise enough to filter out non-relevant information, leading to a large number of irrelevant results.\n\n4. **Lack of Diverse Sources**:\n   - Relied heavily on a few major real estate websites, which were not accessible due to technical issues. Did not explore alternative sources or methods.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Terms**:\n   - Use more specific search terms to target high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for the year 2021.\n   - Search terms: \"highest price high-rise apartment sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\", \"most expensive high-rise condo sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\".\n\n2. **Explore Alternative Real Estate Websites**:\n   - Try other real estate websites that might not have the same access restrictions, such as Trulia, Homes.com, or local real estate portals.\n   - Search for \"Trulia Mission Bay San Francisco recently sold 2021\" and \"Homes.com Mission Bay San Francisco recently sold 2021\".\n\n3. **Check Local Real Estate Reports**:\n   - Visit the San Francisco Association of Realtors website and look for annual reports or market analyses for 2021.\n   - Search for \"San Francisco Association of Realtors 2021 market report\".\n\n4. **Search News Articles and Press Releases**:\n   - Look for news articles or press releases from reputable media outlets covering real estate transactions in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for 2021.\n   - Search for \"highest price high-rise apartment sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 news\".\n\n5. **Contact Luxury Real Estate Brokers**:\n   - Identify and contact luxury real estate brokers and agents who specialize in Mission Bay to gather more specific and detailed information about high-rise apartment sales in 2021.\n   - Search for \"luxury real estate brokers Mission Bay San Francisco\" and send inquiries via their contact forms or email addresses.\n\n### Detailed Actions\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the following search terms: \"highest price high-rise apartment sold Mission Bay San Francisco 2021\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit Trulia and Homes.com, and navigate to the 'Recently Sold' section for Mission Bay, San Francisco.
