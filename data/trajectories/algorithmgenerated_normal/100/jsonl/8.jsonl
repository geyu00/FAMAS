Please solve the task carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US).\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The movie expert will identify all the movies featuring Daniel Craig.\n2. The data analyst will check the IMDB ratings and filter the movies based on the duration (less than 150 minutes).\n3. The streaming service expert will verify the availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n4. The data analyst will then identify the highest rated movie from the filtered list.\n\n## Output format\n- The title of the highest rated Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US).\n- The IMDB rating of the movie.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n- The movie must be less than 150 minutes in duration.\n- The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n- The IMDB rating must be used to determine the highest rated movie.\n\n## Results and reason from last response\nThe only confirmed movie available on Netflix (US) so far is \"Layer Cake (2004)\".\n\nErrors or issues in the conversation:\n1. A code execution error occurred when attempting to perform web searches for multiple movies, resulting in only partial information being obtained.\n2. The script lacks the ability to perform multiple searches within the same execution environment, which led to incomplete verification of movie availability.\n\nNeed to double-check: Yes\n\nAdditional information (file path, code blocks, url, etc.)\nThe search code snippets for verifying movie availability:\n```python\nfrom functions import perform_web_search\n\n# Retry search for Casino Royale (2006) availability on Netflix US\nresult_casino_royale = perform_web_search(\"Casino Royale 2006 Netflix US availability\")\n\nprint(result_casino_royale)\n```\nLayer Cake (2004) availability reference:\n- https://www.netflixreleases.com/layer-cake-2004/"}
{"agent": "StreamingService_Expert", "content": "Let's follow the steps outlined in the plan to identify the highest rated Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and verify its availability on Netflix (US).\n\n### Step 1: Identify Daniel Craig Movies\n\nFrom previous knowledge, here are the notable movies featuring Daniel Craig:\n1. Layer Cake (2004)\n2. Casino Royale (2006)\n3. Quantum of Solace (2008)\n4. Skyfall (2012)\n5. Spectre (2015)\n6. No Time to Die (2021)\n\n### Step 2: Check IMDB Ratings and Duration\n\nNow, I'll filter these movies based on their duration being less than 150 minutes and check their IMDB ratings:\n\n- Layer Cake (2004): 101 minutes, IMDB rating 7.3\n- Casino Royale (2006): 144 minutes, IMDB rating 8.0\n- Quantum of Solace (2008): 106 minutes, IMDB rating 6.6\n- Skyfall (2012): 143 minutes, IMDB rating 7.8\n- Spectre (2015): 148 minutes, IMDB rating 6.8\n- No Time to Die (2021): 163 minutes (exceeds duration limit)\n\nNow, the valid options based on duration are:\n1. Layer Cake (2004): 101 minutes, IMDB rating 7.3\n2. Casino Royale (2006): 144 minutes, IMDB rating 8.0\n3. Quantum of Solace (2008): 106 minutes, IMDB rating 6.6\n4. Skyfall (2012): 143 minutes, IMDB rating 7.8\n5. Spectre (2015): 148 minutes, IMDB rating 6.8\n\n### Step 3: Verify Availability on Netflix (US)\n\nNext, I will check the availability of these filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n\nI will begin with \"Casino Royale (2006)\" since it has the highest IMDB rating among the filtered list.\n\n```python\nfrom functions import perform_web_search\n\n# Search for Casino Royale (2006) availability on Netflix US\nresult_casino_royale = perform_web_search(\"Casino Royale 2006 Netflix US availability\")\n\nprint(result_casino_royale)\n```\n\nNow, I'll execute this code to check for availability.
