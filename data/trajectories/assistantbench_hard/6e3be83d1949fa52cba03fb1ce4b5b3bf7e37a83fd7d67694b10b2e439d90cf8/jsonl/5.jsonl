Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time for the martial arts classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact address of the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - A list of martial arts schools or studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The class schedules for these martial arts schools, particularly those offered between 7-9 pm.\n   - Reviews or ratings of these martial arts schools to ensure quality and reliability.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The actual walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified martial arts schools.\n   - Whether the identified schools offer classes specifically during the 7-9 pm time slot on weekdays.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely several fitness centers and martial arts studios in the Financial District of New York City, given its dense population and high demand for after-work activities.\n   - Some popular martial arts styles like karate, taekwondo, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu might be more commonly available in urban areas like this.\n   - Given the proximity to a major financial hub, the martial arts schools in the area might cater to professionals and have flexible evening hours.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Address of the New York Stock Exchange**: Use WebSurfer to find the exact address of the New York Stock Exchange.\n- **Locate Martial Arts Studios Nearby**: Use WebSurfer to search for martial arts studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n- **Check Class Schedules**: For each identified studio, use WebSurfer to check if they offer classes between 7-9 pm on weekdays.\n- **Verify Walking Distances**: Use WebSurfer to verify the walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to each studio using a mapping service like Google Maps.\n- **Compile and Present Information**: Summarize the findings, including the names, addresses, and class schedules of the martial arts studios that meet the criteria."}
