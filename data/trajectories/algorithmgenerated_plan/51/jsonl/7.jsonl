However, the script is currently returning an error. We need to debug the script and correct it.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Review the provided Python script to identify any syntax or logical errors.\n2. Correct the identified errors in the script.\n3. Test the corrected script with a sample input to ensure it works as expected.\n\n## Output format\n- The corrected Python script\n- The output of the script when tested with a sample input\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The script should correctly process the list of numbers and return the sum of the squares of the even numbers.\n- The script should handle edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with no even numbers.\n\n## Provided Python script\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\nresult = sum_of_squares_even(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```"}
{"agent": "PythonDebugging_Expert", "content": "Let's start by reviewing the provided Python script to identify any syntax or logical errors. The function `sum_of_squares_even` seems to be correctly implemented, as it iterates over the list of numbers, checks if they are even, and sums the squares of the even numbers.\n\nNext, we'll test the script to ensure it works as expected. We will check it with the provided list of numbers and also run some edge cases, such as an empty list and a list with no even numbers.\n\nHere's the complete script with the required tests included:\n\n```python\n# filename: sum_of_squares_even.py\n\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\n# Test cases\ntest_cases = {\n    \"normal_case\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],\n    \"empty_case\": [],\n    \"no_even_case\": [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n}\n\n# Collect results\nresults = {}\nfor key, case in test_cases.items():\n    results[key] = sum_of_squares_even(case)\n\n# Print results\nfor key, value in results.items():\n    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this script and check the results for the normal case, empty case, and the case with no even numbers."}
