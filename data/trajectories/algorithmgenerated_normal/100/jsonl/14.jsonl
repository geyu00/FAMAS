Please solve the task carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US).\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The movie expert will identify all the movies featuring Daniel Craig.\n2. The data analyst will check the IMDB ratings and filter the movies based on the duration (less than 150 minutes).\n3. The streaming service expert will verify the availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n4. The data analyst will then identify the highest rated movie from the filtered list.\n\n## Output format\n- The title of the highest rated Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US).\n- The IMDB rating of the movie.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n- The movie must be less than 150 minutes in duration.\n- The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n- The IMDB rating must be used to determine the highest rated movie.\n\n## Results and reason from last response\nThe only confirmed movie available on Netflix (US) so far is \"Layer Cake (2004)\".\n\nErrors or issues in the conversation:\n1. A code execution error occurred when attempting to perform web searches for multiple movies, resulting in only partial information being obtained.\n2.

{"agent": "StreamingService_Expert", "content": "Let's start by verifying the movie \"Layer Cake (2004)\" that was previously confirmed to be available on Netflix (US).

Here are some notable films featuring Daniel Craig that we will check:\n\n1. **Layer Cake (2004)**\n2. **Casino Royale (2006)**\n3. **Quantum of Solace (2008)**\n4. **Skyfall (2012)**\n5. **Spectre (2015)**\n6. **No Time to Die (2021)**\n\nNext, I'll proceed to check the IMDB ratings and the duration of these films to filter out the ones that are less than 150 minutes. After filtering, I will confirm their availability on Netflix (US).\n\nI'll prepare a script to check the availability of all the relevant Daniel Craig movies. Here's the code snippet I'll run to check the availability of \"Layer Cake (2004)\" and \"Casino Royale (2006)\":\n\n```python\nfrom functions import perform_web_search\n\n# List of Daniel Craig movies to check for availability\nmovies = [\n    \"Layer Cake 2004 Netflix US availability\",\n    \"Casino Royale 2006 Netflix US availability\",\n    \"Quantum of Solace 2008 Netflix US availability\",\n    \"Skyfall 2012 Netflix US availability\",\n    \"Spectre 2015 Netflix US availability\",\n    \"No Time to Die 2021 Netflix US availability\"\n]\n\n# Perform web search for availability\nresults = [perform_web_search(movie) for movie in movies]\n\nprint(results)\n```\n\nI'll execute this code to check the availability of each movie on Netflix (US).
