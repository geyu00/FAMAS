It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be an Isabelle Adjani feature film.\n   - The film must have a high rating on IMDb.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) for purchase or rental.\n   - We have identified two Isabelle Adjani feature films with their IMDb ratings and runtimes:\n     - \"The Last Horror Film\" (1982): 1h 27m, IMDb Rating: 5.6\n     - \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979): 1h 47m, IMDb Rating: 7.4\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDb ratings and runtimes for other Isabelle Adjani feature films.\n   - The availability of \"The Last Horror Film\" and \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n   - The IMDb ratings and runtimes for other highly-rated Isabelle Adjani feature films such as \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975), \"Camille Claudel\" (1988), and \"La Reine Margot\" (1994).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify which of Isabelle Adjani's feature films meet all the criteria: high IMDb rating, less than 2 hours long, and available on Fandango at Home.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the initial search, \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979) has a high IMDb rating of 7.4 and a runtime of 1h 47m, making it a strong candidate. However, its availability on Fandango at Home needs to be verified.\n   - \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) is another highly acclaimed film with a runtime of 1h 45m and an IMDb rating of 7.7. This film should also be checked for availability on Fandango at Home.\n   - \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) and \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) are also critically acclaimed but have longer runtimes. Their runtimes and availability on Fandango at Home need to be verified.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" and \"The Story of Adele H.\" both have high IMDb ratings and runtimes under 2 hours, making them strong candidates.\n- \"The Last Horror Film\" has a lower IMDb rating (5.6) and is less likely to be the highest-rated film meeting all criteria.\n- \"Camille Claudel\" and \"La Reine Margot\" are well-known and critically acclaimed, but their runtimes exceed 2 hours, so they are less likely to meet the criteria unless their exact runtimes are confirmed to be under 2 hours.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Search Parameters**: The initial search on IMDb was limited to the \"Horror\" genre, which excluded many of Isabelle Adjani's highly-rated films in other genres.\n2. **Incomplete Data Extraction**: The search results were not fully explored, and only a few films were considered without verifying their IMDb ratings and runtimes comprehensively.\n3. **Lack of Verification**: The availability of the identified films on Fandango at Home was not checked, which is a crucial part of the task.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Correct Search Parameters**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to IMDb and perform a search for all Isabelle Adjani feature films without genre restrictions.\n   - Ensure the search is sorted by IMDb rating in descending order.\n\n2. **Extract Comprehensive Data**:\n   - Extract the IMDb ratings and runtimes for all Isabelle Adjani feature films from the search results.\n   - Filter the list to include only films with a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n\n3. **Verify Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to visit the Fandango at Home website.\n   - Search for the highest-rated films from the filtered list to check their availability for purchase or rental.\n\n4. **Report Final Result**:\n   - Verify the details (IMDb rating, runtime, and availability) of the highest-rated film that meets all criteria.\n   - Report the final result.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Perform Correct Search on IMDb**\n  - Navigate to IMDb.\n  - Search for \"Isabelle Adjani feature films\" without genre restrictions.\n  - Sort the results by IMDb rating in descending order.\n\n- **Step 2: Extract IMDb Ratings and Runtimes**\n  - Scroll through the search results and extract the IMDb ratings and runtimes for all Isabelle Adjani feature films.\n  - Create a list of films with their IMDb ratings and runtimes.\n\n- **Step 3: Filter Films by Runtime**\n  - Filter the list to include only films with a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n  - Sort the filtered list by IMDb rating in descending order.\n\n- **Step 4: Check Availability on Fandango at Home**\n  - Navigate to the Fandango at Home website.\n  - Search for the highest-rated films from the filtered list.\n  - Verify their availability for purchase or rental.\n\n- **Step 5: Verify and Report**\n  - Confirm the IMDb rating, runtime, and availability of the highest-rated film that meets all criteria.\n  - Report the final result.\n\n### Example Commands\n\n- **Step 1: Perform Correct Search on IMDb**\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&role=nm0000254&sort=ratings,desc\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 2: Extract IMDb Ratings and Runtimes**\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.extractDataFromPage({\n    \"film_title\": \".lister-item-header a\",\n    \"imdb_rating\": \".col-imdb-rating strong\",\n    \"runtime\": \".runtime\"\n  })\n  ```\n\n- **Step 3: Filter Films by Runtime**\n  ```python\n  films = [\n    {\"title\": \"Film A\", \"rating\": 8.5, \"runtime\": \"1h 30m\"},\n    {\"title\": \"Film B\", \"rating\": 8.2, \"runtime\": \"1h 45m\"},\n    # Add more films here\n  ]\n  filtered_films = [film for film in films if int(film[\"runtime\"].split(\"h\")[0]) < 2]\n  filtered_films.sort(key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"], reverse=True)\n  ```\n\n- **Step 4: Check Availability on Fandango at Home**\n  ```sh\n  for film in filtered_films:\n    WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://www.fandango.com/home\")\n    WebSurfer.search(film[\"title\"])\n    WebSurfer.checkAvailability()\n  ```\n\n- **Step 5: Verify and Report**\n  ```python\n  highest_rated_film = filtered_films[0]\n  print(f\"The highest rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and available on Fandango at Home is '{highest_rated_film['title']}' with an IMDb rating of {highest_rated_film['rating']} and a runtime of {highest_rated_film['runtime']}.\")\n  ```\n\nThis plan ensures that we cover all necessary steps and avoid the previous issues by performing a comprehensive search and verification process."}
