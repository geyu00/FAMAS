{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - The transaction fees associated with each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) of each eligible fund from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: This information can typically be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund over the specified period using the performance data.\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that Fidelity offers multiple Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance of these funds can vary significantly, and it is reasonable to assume that some funds may have performed poorly or even decreased in value over the given period.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify Eligible Funds**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Fidelity's official website and find a list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n  - Verify which of these funds have $0 transaction fees.\n\n- **Collect Performance Data**\n  - For each eligible fund, use WebSurfer to gather the performance data (specifically the net asset value or price) for May 2019 and May 2024.\n\n- **Calculate Percentage Increase**\n  - Use Assistant to write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund over the specified period.\n  - Run the Python script using ComputerTerminal to get the results.\n\n- **Determine the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase**\n  - Use Assistant to analyze the results and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n- **Verify and Report**\n  - Double-check the findings using WebSurfer if necessary.\n  - Prepare a final report summarizing the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the relevant data."}

Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n   - Fidelity International offers an Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - The transaction fees associated with each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) of each eligible fund from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: This information can typically be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund over the specified period using the performance data.\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that Fidelity offers multiple Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees. For example, the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) is one such fund, but we need to verify its transaction fees.\n   - The performance of these funds can vary significantly, and it is reasonable to assume that some funds may have performed poorly or even decreased in value over the given period.\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is possible that some funds may have experienced negative returns during the period from May 2019 to May 2024, which would make them candidates for having the lowest percentage increase.\n   - The Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) may be a strong candidate for having low transaction fees, as it is a widely recognized fund in the Fidelity International portfolio.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The identification of the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) provides a concrete starting point for our search. Verifying its transaction fees and performance data will help us narrow down our options.\n- The volatility of emerging markets suggests that some funds may have underperformed, which aligns with our goal of finding the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n- Fidelity's reputation for offering low-fee options makes it a reasonable guess that some of their Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds may indeed have $0 transaction fees.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues**: The web browser failed to load the Fidelity website multiple times, possibly due to network issues or server-side problems.\n2. **Inconsistent Data Retrieval**: Even when the page loaded, the specific data (performance and transaction fees) for the required time period (May 2019 to May 2024) was not easily accessible or visible.\n3. **Lack of Direct Access to Performance Data**: The initial attempts to navigate to the performance section did not yield the necessary historical data, which is crucial for calculating the percentage increase.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Multiple Search Sources**:\n   - **Step 1**: Perform a web search using a search engine to find a reliable source that lists all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds, their transaction fees, and performance data from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **Hint**: Use specific keywords like \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds list with transaction fees and performance data May 2019 to May 2024.\"\n\n2. **Navigate to Specific Fund Pages**:\n   - **Step 2**: Click on the first few links that appear in the search results to find a reliable source.\n   - **Step 3**: Navigate to the 'Fund pricing and performance' section of each fund page to find the performance data for May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **Hint**: Look for historical performance charts or tables that show monthly or yearly performance.\n\n3. **Verify Transaction Fees**:\n   - **Step 4**: Check the transaction fees for each fund. This information is often found in the fund's overview or detailed description.\n   - **Hint**: Look for sections labeled \"Fees\" or \"Charges.\"\n\n4. **Extract Performance Data**:\n   - **Step 5**: Extract the net asset value (NAV) or price of each eligible fund for May 2019 and May 2024.\n   - **Hint**: If the exact dates are not available, use the closest available dates within the month.\n\n5. **Calculate Percentage Increase**:\n   - **Step 6**: Use Assistant to write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund over the specified period.\n   - **Step 7**: Run the Python script using ComputerTerminal to get the results.\n   - **Python Script Example**:\n     ```python\n     def calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n         return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\n     # Example data\n     funds = {\n         'Fund A': {'May 2019': 100, 'May 2024': 120},\n         'Fund B': {'May 2019': 150, 'May 2024': 140},\n         'Fund C': {'May 2019': 200, 'May 2024': 210}\n     }\n\n     results = {}\n     for fund, values in funds.items():\n         start_value = values['May 2019']\n         end_value = values['May 2024']\n         percentage_increase = calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value)\n         results[fund] = percentage_increase\n\n     # Find the fund with the lowest percentage increase\n     lowest_increase_fund = min(results, key=results.get)\n     print(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with an increase of {results[lowest_increase_fund]:.2f}%\")\n     ```\n\n6. **Identify the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase**:\n   - **Step 8**: Use Assistant to analyze the results and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   - **Step 9**: Double-check the findings using WebSurfer if necessary.\n\n7. **Prepare Final Report**:\n   - **Step 10**: Prepare a final report summarizing the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the relevant data.\n   - **Hint**: Include the name of the fund, its transaction fees, and the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n\nBy following this plan, we aim to avoid the previous issues and ensure that we gather the necessary data accurately and efficiently."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n   - Fidelity International offers an Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - The transaction fees associated with each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) of each eligible fund from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: This information can typically be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund over the specified period using the performance data.\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that Fidelity offers multiple Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees. For example, the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) is one such fund, but we need to verify its transaction fees.\n   - The performance of these funds can vary significantly, and it is reasonable to assume that some funds may have performed poorly or even decreased in value over the given period.\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is possible that some funds may have experienced negative returns during the period from May 2019 to May 2024, which would make them candidates for having the lowest percentage increase.\n   - The Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) may be a strong candidate for having low transaction fees, as it is a widely recognized fund in the Fidelity International portfolio.\n   - **New Educated Guess**: The Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) is likely to have detailed performance data available on the Fidelity website, which will be crucial for our calculations. Additionally, the transaction fees for this fund are likely to be listed clearly in the fund's overview or detailed description.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The identification of the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) provides a concrete starting point for our search. Verifying its transaction fees and performance data will help us narrow down our options.\n- The volatility of emerging markets suggests that some funds may have underperformed, which aligns with our goal of finding the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n- Fidelity's reputation for offering low-fee options makes it a reasonable guess that some of their Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds may indeed have $0 transaction fees.\n- The detailed performance data and transaction fee information for the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) are likely to be readily available on the Fidelity website, which will be crucial for our calculations.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the 'Fund pricing and performance' section** of the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) page.\n2. **Extract the transaction fees** and the Net Asset Value (NAV) or price for May 2019 and May 2024. If the exact dates are not available, use the closest available dates within the month.\n3. **Repeat the process** for other Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds to ensure we have a comprehensive list.\n4. **Calculate the percentage increase** for each eligible fund using the extracted data.\n5. **Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase** and prepare a final report summarizing the findings.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues**: The web browser failed to load the specific sections of the Fidelity website, particularly the 'Fund pricing and performance' section, which contains the critical data we need.\n2. **Inconsistent Data Retrieval**: Even when the page loaded, the specific data (performance and transaction fees) for the required time period (May 2019 to May 2024) was not easily accessible or visible.\n3. **Lack of Direct Access to Performance Data**: The initial attempts to navigate to the performance section did not yield the necessary historical data, which is crucial for calculating the percentage increase.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Multiple Search Sources**:\n   - **Step 1**: Perform a web search using a search engine to find a reliable source that lists all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds, their transaction fees, and performance data from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **Hint**: Use specific keywords like \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds list with transaction fees and performance data May 2019 to May 2024.\"\n\n2. **Navigate to Specific Fund Pages**:\n   - **Step 2**: Click on the first few links that appear in the search results to find a reliable source.\n   - **Step 3**: Navigate to the 'Fund pricing and performance' section of each fund page to find the performance data for May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **Hint**: Look for historical performance charts or tables that show monthly or yearly performance.\n\n3. **Verify Transaction Fees**:\n   - **Step 4**: Check the transaction fees for each fund. This information is often found in the fund's overview or detailed description.\n   - **Hint**: Look for sections labeled \"Fees\" or \"Charges.\"\n\n4. **Extract Performance Data**:\n   - **Step 5**: Extract the net asset value (NAV) or price of each eligible fund for May 2019 and May 2024.\n   - **Hint**: If the exact dates are not available, use the closest available dates within the month.\n\n5. **Calculate Percentage Increase**:\n   - **Step 6**: Use Assistant to write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund over the specified period.\n   - **Step 7**: Run the Python script using ComputerTerminal to get the results.\n   - **Python Script Example**:\n     ```python\n     def calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n         return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\n     # Example data\n     funds = {\n         'Fund A': {'May 2019': 100, 'May 2024': 120},\n         'Fund B': {'May 2019': 150, 'May 2024': 140},\n         'Fund C': {'May 2019': 200, 'May 2024': 210}\n     }\n\n     results = {}\n     for fund, values in funds.items():\n         start_value = values['May 2019']\n         end_value = values['May 2024']\n         percentage_increase = calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value)\n         results[fund] = percentage_increase\n\n     # Find the fund with the lowest percentage increase\n     lowest_increase_fund = min(results, key=results.get)\n     print(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with an increase of {results[lowest_increase_fund]:.2f}%\")\n     ```\n\n6. **Identify the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase**:\n   - **Step 8**: Use Assistant to analyze the results and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   - **Step 9**: Double-check the findings using WebSurfer if necessary.\n\n7. **Prepare Final Report**:\n   - **Step 10**: Prepare a final report summarizing the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the relevant data.\n   - **Hint**: Include the name of the fund, its transaction fees, and the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n\n### Additional Hints\n\n- **Use WebSurfer to Scroll and Wait**: If the page loads slowly or does not display all the data initially, use WebSurfer to scroll down and wait for the page to fully load.\n- **Check Multiple Sources**: If the Fidelity website is not providing the necessary data, check other financial websites like Morningstar or Yahoo Finance for the required information.\n- **Document Each Step**: Keep a record of each step and the data collected to ensure accuracy and traceability.\n\nBy following this new plan, we aim to avoid the previous issues and ensure that we gather the necessary data accurately and efficiently."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n   - Fidelity International offers an Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - The transaction fees associated with each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) of each eligible fund from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: This information can typically be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund over the specified period using the performance data.\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that Fidelity offers multiple Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees. For example, the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) is one such fund, but we need to verify its transaction fees.\n   - The performance of these funds can vary significantly, and it is reasonable to assume that some funds may have performed poorly or even decreased in value over the given period.\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is possible that some funds may have experienced negative returns during the period from May 2019 to May 2024, which would make them candidates for having the lowest percentage increase.\n   - The Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) may be a strong candidate for having low transaction fees, as it is a widely recognized fund in the Fidelity International portfolio.\n   - **New Educated Guess**: Since the Fidelity website is not providing the necessary data, it is likely that we need to look at other financial websites like Morningstar or Yahoo Finance to find the detailed performance data and transaction fees for the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) and other similar funds.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The identification of the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) provides a concrete starting point for our search. Verifying its transaction fees and performance data will help us narrow down our options.\n- The volatility of emerging markets suggests that some funds may have underperformed, which aligns with our goal of finding the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n- Fidelity's reputation for offering low-fee options makes it a reasonable guess that some of their Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds may indeed have $0 transaction fees.\n- The detailed performance data and transaction fee information for the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) are likely to be readily available on other financial websites, which will be crucial for our calculations.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Search on Other Financial Websites**:\n   - Perform a web search using a search engine to find a reliable source that lists all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds, their transaction fees, and performance data from May 2019 to May 2024. Use specific keywords like \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds list with transaction fees and performance data May 2019 to May 2024.\"\n   - Check financial websites like Morningstar or Yahoo Finance for the required information.\n\n2. **Extract Performance Data**:\n   - Once the correct page is found, extract the Net Asset Value (NAV) or price for May 2019 and May 2024 for the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) and other eligible funds.\n   - Verify the transaction fees for each fund.\n\n3. **Calculate Percentage Increase**:\n   - Use Assistant to write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund over the specified period.\n   - Run the Python script using ComputerTerminal to get the results.\n\n4. **Identify the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase**:\n   - Analyze the results to identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   - Double-check the findings using WebSurfer if necessary.\n\n5. **Prepare Final Report**:\n   - Prepare a final report summarizing the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the relevant data.\n   - Include the name of the fund, its transaction fees, and the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n\n### Additional Hints\n- **Use WebSurfer to Scroll and Wait**: If the page loads slowly or does not display all the data initially, use WebSurfer to scroll down and wait for the page to fully load.\n- **Check Multiple Sources**: If the Fidelity website is not providing the necessary data, check other financial websites like Morningstar or Yahoo Finance for the required information.\n- **Document Each Step**: Keep a record of each step and the data collected to ensure accuracy and traceability.\n\nBy following this updated plan, we aim to gather the necessary data accurately and efficiently.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues**: The web browser failed to load the specific sections of the Fidelity website, particularly the 'Fund pricing and performance' section, which contains the critical data we need.\n2. **Inconsistent Data Retrieval**: Even when the page loaded, the specific data (performance and transaction fees) for the required time period (May 2019 to May 2024) was not easily accessible or visible.\n3. **Lack of Direct Access to Performance Data**: The initial attempts to navigate to the performance section did not yield the necessary historical data, which is crucial for calculating the percentage increase.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Multiple Search Sources**:\n   - **Step 1**: Perform a web search using a search engine to find a reliable source that lists all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds, their transaction fees, and performance data from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **Keywords**: \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds list with transaction fees and performance data May 2019 to May 2024.\"\n   - **Hint**: Check financial websites like Morningstar or Yahoo Finance for the required information.\n\n2. **Navigate to Specific Fund Pages**:\n   - **Step 2**: Click on the first few links that appear in the search results to find a reliable source.\n   - **Step 3**: Navigate to the 'Fund pricing and performance' section of each fund page to find the performance data for May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **Hint**: Look for historical performance charts or tables that show monthly or yearly performance.\n\n3. **Verify Transaction Fees**:\n   - **Step 4**: Check the transaction fees for each fund. This information is often found in the fund's overview or detailed description.\n   - **Hint**: Look for sections labeled \"Fees\" or \"Charges.\"\n\n4. **Extract Performance Data**:\n   - **Step 5**: Extract the net asset value (NAV) or price of each eligible fund for May 2019 and May 2024.\n   - **Hint**: If the exact dates are not available, use the closest available dates within the month.\n\n5. **Calculate Percentage Increase**:\n   - **Step 6**: Use Assistant to write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund over the specified period.\n   - **Step 7**: Run the Python script using ComputerTerminal to get the results.\n   - **Python Script Example**:\n     ```python\n     def calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n         return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\n     # Example data\n     funds = {\n         'Fund A': {'May 2019': 100, 'May 2024': 120},\n         'Fund B': {'May 2019': 150, 'May 2024': 140},\n         'Fund C': {'May 2019': 200, 'May 2024': 210}\n     }\n\n     results = {}\n     for fund, values in funds.items():\n         start_value = values['May 2019']\n         end_value = values['May 2024']\n         percentage_increase = calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value)\n         results[fund] = percentage_increase\n\n     # Find the fund with the lowest percentage increase\n     lowest_increase_fund = min(results, key=results.get)\n     print(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with an increase of {results[lowest_increase_fund]:.2f}%\")\n     ```\n\n6. **Identify the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase**:\n   - **Step 8**: Use Assistant to analyze the results and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   - **Step 9**: Double-check the findings using WebSurfer if necessary.\n\n7. **Prepare Final Report**:\n   - **Step 10**: Prepare a final report summarizing the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the relevant data.\n   - **Hint**: Include the name of the fund, its transaction fees, and the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n\n### Additional Hints\n\n- **Use WebSurfer to Scroll and Wait**: If the page loads slowly or does not display all the data initially, use WebSurfer to scroll down and wait for the page to fully load.\n- **Check Multiple Sources**: If the Fidelity website is not providing the necessary data, check other financial websites like Morningstar or Yahoo Finance for the required information.\n- **Document Each Step**: Keep a record of each step and the data collected to ensure accuracy and traceability.\n\n### Initial Action\n\nPerform a web search using a search engine to find a reliable source that lists all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds, their transaction fees, and performance data from May 2019 to May 2024.
