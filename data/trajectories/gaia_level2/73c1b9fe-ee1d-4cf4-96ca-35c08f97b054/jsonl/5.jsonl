{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking for the year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source mentioned is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - This information can be found in the USGS records or publications related to wildlife distribution and historical sightings.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, so it is likely that any sightings west of Texas would be relatively recent, possibly within the last few decades.\n   - However, without specific data, this is just a guess and needs verification from the USGS records.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** WebSurfer will perform a web search using the query \"USGS American Alligator first found west of Texas.\"\n- **Step 2:** WebSurfer will review the search results to find authoritative USGS sources or publications that mention the specific year.\n- **Step 3:** If the information is found, WebSurfer will extract and verify the year from the USGS source.\n- **Step 4:** If the information is not directly available, WebSurfer will navigate to the USGS website and search their database or publications section for relevant historical records.\n- **Step 5:** Once the year is confirmed, Assistant will provide the final answer to the request."}

American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998).Disclaimer:\nThe Nonindigenous Occurrences section of the NAS species profiles has a new structure. The section is now dynamically updated from the NAS database to ensure that it contains the most current and accurate information. Occurrences are summarized in Table 1, alphabetically by state, with years of earliest and most recent observations, and the tally and names of drainages where the species was observed. The table contains hyperlinks to collections tables of specimens based on the states, years, and drainages selected. References to specimens that were not obtained through sighting reports and personal communications are found through the hyperlink in the Table 1 caption or through the individual specimens linked in the collections tables.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"og:site_name\": \"USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221\",\n        \"og:title\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/XIMAGESERVERX/2019/20190613131315.JPG\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Species summary for American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis)\",\n        \"Description\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The alligators spotted in Essex County, New Jersey, may have escaped a lagoon in Military Park, Newark (Anonymous in Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n Perhaps they had been part of a public animal display.\n The \nA. mississippiensis collected from Mesa County, Colorado, escaped from a roadside zoo (Livo et al., 1998), while the one collected from the Colorado River in California had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978).\n Conant (1977) suggested that an animal dealer intentionally established the \nA. mississippiensis population found in the Brownsville area of Cameron County, Texas.\nStatus: All the American alligators found in New York have been collected (Anderson and Habuda, 2001; Anonymous, 2001a, b; Beebe, 2001c; Heaton-Jones, 2001; Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). They are not established in this state nor could they survive the cold winters, and the story of alligators dwelling in New York City sewers is simply a well-entrenched myth (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). One of the alligators found in Union County, New Jersey, was collected; although there is no further word about the success of the 1933 great gator hunt started on the Passaic River in Essex County (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n All \nA. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).\n Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous \nA. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are \"thriving.\" There is no evidence of reproduction.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as \"not well established\" in Arizona.\nImpact of Introduction: There is no evidence that any of the nonindigenous occurrences of American alligators have had any impact on indigenous ecosystems; however, an established population of these massive carnivores in a southwestern state could negatively impact indigenous fauna. The introductions in Oklahoma, and the presumptive introduction in Cameron County, Texas, could compromise the genetic integrity of extant indigenous populations. As mentioned above, the status of indigenous alligators in Oklahoma could be obfuscated, thus creating difficulties when deciding conservation measures and future protective legislation. A large alligator is a potentially dangerous carnivore.\n While attacks on humans are exceedingly rare, they do occur on occasion (Pooley et al., 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Anonymous, 2002).\nRemarks: The taxonomy of A. mississippiensis has been reviewed or summarized by Smith and Smith (1977), King (1989), Ross and Ernst (1994), and Crother et al. (2000). Liner (1994) provides a Spanish vernacular name for the American alligator.  Brisbin et al. (1986), Gibbons and Semlitsch (1991), and Ross and Ernst (1994) provide the best literature reviews of the natural history of alligators. A variety of authors have contributed to or summarized the natural history and biology of American alligators (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973, 1976; Mount, 1975; Lang, 1987, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Vliet, 1989; and a variety of contributions compiled by Webb et al., 1987). Scientific and standard English names follow Crother (2008).Alligator mississippiensis is an aquatic, omnicarnivorous reptile capable of living in many types of waterways, both natural and man-made, and feeding upon almost any fauna it can catch (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Mount, 1975; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Some alligators dig deep holes with connecting dens than can remain filled with water during droughts, thus maintaining an aquatic environment for indigenous fauna (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Grenard, 1991).\n Courtship and mating involves complex visual and auditory displays directed at prospective mates and competitors (McIlhenny, 1935; Lang, 1987, 1989; Vliet, 1989).\n The female buries her hard-shelled eggs in a nest she constructs of dead vegetation and the surrounding muck (McIlhenny, 1935; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Females exhibit varying degrees of parental care by guarding the nest, releasing hatchlings from the nest and eggs, and transporting them to water in her mouth (Kushlan and Simon, 1981; Lang, 1987; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n Young may remain in a protective crèche with the mother and sometimes other adults for a considerable length of time, sometimes exceeding a year (Lang, 1987, 1989; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n American alligators are subject to a variety of state and federal regulations (Levell, 1997); they should not be obtained by anyone before such legislation is understood along the responsibility that goes with keeping them as captives.\nReferences \n(click for full references) Ashton, R.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking for the year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source mentioned is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database provides detailed records of nonindigenous occurrences of the American Alligator in various states.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - This information can be found in the USGS NAS database or publications related to wildlife distribution and historical sightings.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, so it is likely that any sightings west of Texas would be relatively recent, possibly within the last few decades.\n   - Based on the USGS NAS database, the earliest recorded nonindigenous occurrence of the American Alligator in states west of Texas (such as Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico) appears to be in the late 20th century. For example, the earliest recorded sighting in Arizona was in 1990.\n   - Given the data from the USGS NAS database, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the first recorded sighting of the American Alligator west of Texas (not including Texas) might be around the 1990s, but this needs to be confirmed by reviewing the specific entries for each state.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The USGS NAS database provides a comprehensive list of nonindigenous occurrences, which helps narrow down the timeframe.\n- The earliest recorded sighting in Arizona (1990) suggests that the first sightings in other western states might be around the same period or slightly earlier.\n- Further review of the database for states like New Mexico and Nevada will help confirm the exact year.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Review the USGS NAS database entries for states like New Mexico and Nevada to find the earliest recorded year of the American Alligator being found west of Texas.\n- Confirm the specific year and provide the final answer to the request.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: We did not efficiently navigate to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section of the USGS NAS database page, leading to repeated scrolling without finding the relevant information.\n- **Lack of Specific Focus**: We did not specifically focus on the states west of Texas (like New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada) and their earliest recorded years.\n- **Missed Key Information**: We missed key information in the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' table that could have provided the answer.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate directly to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section of the USGS NAS database page.\n- **Step 2**: Identify and focus on the states west of Texas (New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada).\n- **Step 3**: Extract the earliest recorded year for each of these states.\n- **Step 4**: Determine the earliest year among the identified states.\n- **Step 5**: Provide the final answer to the request.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1**: WebSurfer will navigate to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section of the USGS NAS database page.\n  - **Hint**: Use the search function within the page to quickly locate the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section.\n\n- **Step 2**: WebSurfer will identify and focus on the states west of Texas (New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada).\n  - **Hint**: Look for these states in the table and note the 'First Observed' column.\n\n- **Step 3**: WebSurfer will extract the earliest recorded year for each of these states.\n  - **Hint**: Note the 'First Observed' year for each state.\n\n- **Step 4**: WebSurfer will determine the earliest year among the identified states.\n  - **Hint**: Compare the years and identify the earliest one.\n\n- **Step 5**: Assistant will provide the final answer to the request.\n  - **Hint**: Clearly state the earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas.\n\n### Execution\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section.\n  - **Action**: Use the search function within the page to find \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\".\n- **Step 2**: Identify and focus on the states west of Texas.\n  - **Action**: Look for New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada in the table.\n- **Step 3**: Extract the earliest recorded year for each state.\n  - **Action**: Note the 'First Observed' year for each state.\n- **Step 4**: Determine the earliest year among the identified states.\n  - **Action**: Compare the years and identify the earliest one.\n- **Step 5**: Provide the final answer.\n  - **Action**: Clearly state the earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. WebSurfer, please navigate to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section of the USGS NAS database page and identify the earliest recorded year for New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking for the year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source mentioned is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database provides detailed records of nonindigenous occurrences of the American Alligator in various states.\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - This information can be found in the USGS NAS database or publications related to wildlife distribution and historical sightings.\n   - The earliest recorded nonindigenous occurrences of the American Alligator in states west of Texas (New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, so it is likely that any sightings west of Texas would be relatively recent, possibly within the last few decades.\n   - Based on the USGS NAS database, the earliest recorded nonindigenous occurrence of the American Alligator in states west of Texas (such as Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico) appears to be in the late 20th century. For example, the earliest recorded sighting in Arizona was in 1990.\n   - Given the data from the USGS NAS database, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the first recorded sighting of the American Alligator west of Texas (not including Texas) might be around the 1990s, but this needs to be confirmed by reviewing the specific entries for each state.\n\n**Updated Reasoning for Educated Guesses:**\n- The USGS NAS database provides a comprehensive list of nonindigenous occurrences, which helps narrow down the timeframe.\n- The earliest recorded sighting in Arizona (1990) suggests that the first sightings in other western states might be around the same period or slightly earlier.\n- Further review of the database for states like New Mexico and Nevada will help confirm the exact year.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Step 1**: Navigate directly to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section of the USGS NAS database page for the American Alligator.\n- **Step 2**: Identify and focus on the states west of Texas (New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada).\n- **Step 3**: Extract the earliest recorded year for each of these states.\n- **Step 4**: Determine the earliest year among the identified states.\n- **Step 5**: Provide the final answer to the request.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1**: WebSurfer will navigate to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section of the USGS NAS database page for the American Alligator.\n  - **Action**: Click on 'Reptiles' under 'Taxa Information', then select 'American Alligator'.\n- **Step 2**: WebSurfer will identify and focus on the states west of Texas (New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada).\n  - **Action**: Scroll down to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section and look for New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada.\n- **Step 3**: WebSurfer will extract the earliest recorded year for each of these states.\n  - **Action**: Note the 'First Observed' year for each state.\n- **Step 4**: WebSurfer will determine the earliest year among the identified states.\n  - **Action**: Compare the years and identify the earliest one.\n- **Step 5**: Assistant will provide the final answer to the request.\n  - **Action**: Clearly state the earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. WebSurfer, please navigate to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section of the USGS NAS database page for the American Alligator and identify the earliest recorded year for New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: We repeatedly navigated to the wrong sections of the USGS NAS database page, failing to reach the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section for the American Alligator.\n- **Lack of Specific Focus**: We did not specifically focus on the states west of Texas (New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada) and their earliest recorded years.\n- **Missed Key Information**: We missed key information in the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' table that could have provided the answer.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate directly to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section of the USGS NAS database page for the American Alligator.\n  - **Action**: Click on 'Reptiles' under 'Taxa Information', then select 'American Alligator'.\n  - **Hint**: Ensure the page is fully loaded before proceeding to the next step.\n\n- **Step 2**: Identify and focus on the states west of Texas (New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada).\n  - **Action**: Scroll down to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section and look for New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada.\n  - **Hint**: Use the search function within the page to quickly locate the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section if necessary.\n\n- **Step 3**: Extract the earliest recorded year for each of these states.\n  - **Action**: Note the 'First Observed' year for each state.\n  - **Hint**: Pay close attention to the 'First Observed' column and ensure all relevant states are checked.\n\n- **Step 4**: Determine the earliest year among the identified states.\n  - **Action**: Compare the years and identify the earliest one.\n  - **Hint**: Double-check the dates to avoid any errors.\n\n- **Step 5**: Provide the final answer to the request.\n  - **Action**: Clearly state the earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas.\n  - **Hint**: Ensure the answer is concise and directly addresses the user's question.\n\n### Execution\n\n- **Step 1**: WebSurfer, please navigate to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section of the USGS NAS database page for the American Alligator.\n  - **Action**: Click on 'Reptiles' under 'Taxa Information', then select 'American Alligator'.\n  - **Hint**: Ensure the page is fully loaded before proceeding to the next step.\n\n- **Step 2**: Identify and focus on the states west of Texas (New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada).\n  - **Action**: Scroll down to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section and look for New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada.\n  - **Hint**: Use the search function within the page to quickly locate the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section if necessary.\n\n- **Step 3**: Extract the earliest recorded year for each of these states.\n  - **Action**: Note the 'First Observed' year for each state.\n  - **Hint**: Pay close attention to the 'First Observed' column and ensure all relevant states are checked.\n\n- **Step 4**: Determine the earliest year among the identified states.\n  - **Action**: Compare the years and identify the earliest one.\n  - **Hint**: Double-check the dates to avoid any errors.\n\n- **Step 5**: Provide the final answer to the request.\n  - **Action**: Clearly state the earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas.\n  - **Hint**: Ensure the answer is concise and directly addresses the user's question.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan.

American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998).\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"og:site_name\": \"USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221\",\n        \"og:title\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/XIMAGESERVERX/2019/20190613131315.JPG\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Species summary for American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis)\",\n        \"Description\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

There is no indication that any of the introduced populations have become established or are reproducing (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\nReferences: Bury, R.B. and J.A.
