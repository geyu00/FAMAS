Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking for pitchers with the number before and after Taishō Tamai's number as of July 2023.\n   - The request specifies the format: \"Pitcher Before, Pitcher After\" using last names only in Roman characters.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Taishō Tamai's number as of July 2023.\n   - The numbers of the pitchers immediately before and after Taishō Tamai's number as of July 2023.\n   - The last names of these pitchers in Roman characters.\n   - These facts can be found in official baseball statistics websites, such as MLB.com, ESPN, or the official website of the league where Taishō Tamai plays (if not in MLB).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Once the numbers of the pitchers before and after Taishō Tamai are known, their last names must be identified and confirmed.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that Taishō Tamai is a pitcher, it is likely he plays in a professional league, possibly in Japan or another country with a strong baseball tradition.\n   - The pitchers before and after him are likely to be active players in the same league or team.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the League and Team**: Determine which league and team Taishō Tamai plays for as of July 2023.\n- **Find Taishō Tamai's Number**: Use WebSurfer to search for Taishō Tamai's player profile on the official league website or a reputable sports news site to find his current jersey number.\n- **Locate the Roster**: Once the number is known, use WebSurfer to find the team's current roster as of July 2023.\n- **Identify Adjacent Numbers**: On the roster, identify the pitchers with the numbers immediately before and after Taishō Tamai's number.\n- **Extract Last Names**: Ensure the last names of these pitchers are in Roman characters.\n- **Format the Answer**: Provide the names in the requested format: \"Pitcher Before, Pitcher After\"."}
