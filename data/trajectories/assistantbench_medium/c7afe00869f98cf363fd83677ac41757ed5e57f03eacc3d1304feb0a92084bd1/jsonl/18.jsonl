Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of Daniel Craig movies and their respective runtimes.\n   - IMDB ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - Availability of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Filter the list of Daniel Craig's movies to those that are less than 150 minutes.\n   - Determine the highest IMDB rating among the filtered list.\n   - Confirm the availability of the highest-rated movie on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Daniel Craig is known for his role as James Bond, but he has also starred in other notable films.\n   - Some of his non-Bond films, such as \"Knives Out\" and \"Logan Lucky,\" are highly rated and might fit the criteria.\n   - Netflix (US) frequently updates its catalog, so the availability of movies can change.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for a comprehensive list of Daniel Craig's movies, including their IMDB ratings and runtimes.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to check the current availability of these movies on Netflix (US).\n- **Step 3:** Filter the list to include only movies that are less than 150 minutes long.\n- **Step 4:** Identify the highest-rated movie from the filtered list.\n- **Step 5:** Verify the final selection by cross-referencing the movie's details (rating, runtime, and availability) on IMDB and Netflix (US)."}

His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as Bond.He was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II at the 2022 Queen's New Years Honours for his services to Film and Theatre.Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy\n21 wins & 83 nominations totalPhotos\n902\n+ 896\nKnown for\nNo Time to Die\n7.3\nJames Bond2021Casino Royale\n8.0\nJames Bond2006Skyfall\n7.8\nJames Bond2012Spectre\n6.8\nJames Bond2015Credits\nEdit\nMore to explore\nList\nIMDb Summer Watch Guide\nBrowse the guide\nEditorial lists\nRelated lists created by IMDb editors\nIMDb staff picks: The best movies & series of 2022\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n56 images\nWeekend box office: Nov. 24 to Nov. 27\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n10 images\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of Daniel Craig movies and their respective runtimes.\n   - IMDB ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - Availability of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Filter the list of Daniel Craig's movies to those that are less than 150 minutes.\n   - Determine the highest IMDB rating among the filtered list.\n   - Confirm the availability of the highest-rated movie on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Daniel Craig is known for his role as James Bond, but he has also starred in other notable films.\n   - Some of his non-Bond films, such as \"Knives Out\" and \"Logan Lucky,\" are highly rated and might fit the criteria.\n   - Netflix (US) frequently updates its catalog, so the availability of movies can change.\n   - Based on the IMDb page, \"Knives Out\" (2019) has a high IMDB rating of 7.9 and a runtime of 130 minutes, which fits the criteria. It is a strong candidate and should be checked for availability on Netflix (US).\n   - \"Logan Lucky\" (2017) has a good IMDB rating of 7.0 and a runtime of 119 minutes, making it another potential candidate to check for availability on Netflix (US).\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- \"Knives Out\" and \"Logan Lucky\" are both highly rated and within the required runtime, making them strong candidates.\n- These films are popular and have been well-received, increasing the likelihood that they are available on major streaming platforms like Netflix (US).\n\nNext steps:\n- Check the availability of \"Knives Out\" and \"Logan Lucky\" on Netflix (US).\n- If either is available, confirm the IMDB rating and runtime to ensure they meet all criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure\n- **Incomplete Data Extraction**: The previous attempts to extract the list of Daniel Craig's movies, their IMDB ratings, and runtimes were not successful because the scrolling and extraction process did not capture the full list of movies.\n- **Lack of Structured Data Collection**: The data was not collected in a structured format, making it difficult to filter and analyze.\n- **Manual Scrolling Limitations**: Manual scrolling through the IMDb page was inefficient and did not ensure that all relevant information was captured.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Automate Data Extraction**:\n   - **Use WebSurfer to Navigate and Extract Data**:\n     - Navigate to the IMDb page for Daniel Craig.\n     - Scroll down the page automatically to ensure all movies are loaded.\n     - Extract the list of movies, their IMDB ratings, and runtimes in a structured format.\n\n2. **Filter and Analyze Data**:\n   - **Filter Movies by Runtime**:\n     - Use Python to filter the list of movies to those that are less than 150 minutes.\n   - **Determine the Highest Rated Movie**:\n     - Use Python to identify the highest-rated movie from the filtered list.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Netflix (US)**:\n   - **Use WebSurfer to Check Netflix (US) Catalog**:\n     - Navigate to the Netflix (US) website.\n     - Search for the highest-rated movie from the filtered list.\n     - Confirm its availability.\n\n4. **Final Verification**:\n   - **Cross-Reference Details**:\n     - Verify the IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability of the selected movie.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **Navigate to IMDb Page and Extract Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the IMDb page for Daniel Craig.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down the page automatically to load all movies.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of movies, their IMDB ratings, and runtimes in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON).\n\n2. **Filter and Analyze Data**:\n   - **Python Script**: Filter the list of movies to those that are less than 150 minutes.\n   - **Python Script**: Identify the highest-rated movie from the filtered list.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Netflix (US)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Netflix (US) website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the highest-rated movie from the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm its availability.\n\n4. **Final Verification**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability of the selected movie.\n\n### Python Script for Data Filtering and Analysis\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Sample data structure (to be replaced with actual extracted data)\ndata = [\n    {\"title\": \"Knives Out\", \"rating\": 7.9, \"runtime\": 130},\n    {\"title\": \"Logan Lucky\", \"rating\": 7.0, \"runtime\": 119},\n    {\"title\": \"Skyfall\", \"rating\": 7.8, \"runtime\": 143},\n    {\"title\": \"Casino Royale\", \"rating\": 8.0, \"runtime\": 144},\n    # Add more movies here\n]\n\n# Filter movies by runtime\nfiltered_movies = [movie for movie in data if movie[\"runtime\"] < 150]\n\n# Determine the highest rated movie\nhighest_rated_movie = max(filtered_movies, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n\n# Output the highest rated movie\nprint(highest_rated_movie)\n```\n\n### Execution\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the IMDb page for Daniel Craig and extract the data.\n2. **Python Script**: Run the provided script to filter and analyze the data.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Check the availability of the highest-rated movie on Netflix (US).\n4. **Final Verification**: Cross-reference the details to ensure accuracy."}

Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of Daniel Craig movies and their respective runtimes.\n   - IMDB ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - Availability of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Filter the list of Daniel Craig's movies to those that are less than 150 minutes.\n   - Determine the highest IMDB rating among the filtered list.\n   - Confirm the availability of the highest-rated movie on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Daniel Craig is known for his role as James Bond, but he has also starred in other notable films.\n   - Some of his non-Bond films, such as \"Knives Out\" and \"Logan Lucky,\" are highly rated and might fit the criteria.\n   - Netflix (US) frequently updates its catalog, so the availability of movies can change.\n   - Based on the IMDb page, \"Knives Out\" (2019) has a high IMDB rating of 7.9 and a runtime of 130 minutes, which fits the criteria. It is a strong candidate and should be checked for availability on Netflix (US).\n   - \"Logan Lucky\" (2017) has a good IMDB rating of 7.0 and a runtime of 119 minutes, making it another potential candidate to check for availability on Netflix (US).\n   - \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" (2011) has a high IMDB rating of 7.8 and a runtime of 158 minutes, which is slightly over the limit but worth checking if it's available on Netflix (US) and if there are any special editions or versions with shorter runtimes.\n   - \"The Invasion\" (2007) has a moderate IMDB rating of 5.9 and a runtime of 98 minutes, making it a potential candidate if higher-rated options are not available.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- \"Knives Out\" and \"Logan Lucky\" remain strong candidates due to their high ratings and suitable runtimes.\n- \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a well-known film and might be available on Netflix (US), even though its runtime is slightly over the limit. Checking for any shorter versions or special editions could be worthwhile.\n- \"The Invasion\" is a less prominent film but meets the runtime requirement and is worth checking for availability on Netflix (US).\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to IMDb Page for Daniel Craig**:\n   - Ensure the correct IMDb page for Daniel Craig (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001136/) is accessed.\n   - Scroll down the page to load all of his movies.\n   - Extract the list of movies, their IMDB ratings, and runtimes in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV).\n\n2. **Filter and Analyze Data**:\n   - Use Python to filter the list of movies to those that are less than 150 minutes.\n   - Identify the highest-rated movie from the filtered list.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Netflix (US)**:\n   - Navigate to the Netflix (US) website.\n   - Search for the highest-rated movie from the filtered list.\n   - Confirm its availability.\n\n4. **Final Verification**:\n   - Cross-reference the IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability of the selected movie to ensure all criteria are met.\n\n### Python Script for Data Filtering and Analysis\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Sample data structure (to be replaced with actual extracted data)\ndata = [\n    {\"title\": \"Knives Out\", \"rating\": 7.9, \"runtime\": 130},\n    {\"title\": \"Logan Lucky\", \"rating\": 7.0, \"runtime\": 119},\n    {\"title\": \"Skyfall\", \"rating\": 7.8, \"runtime\": 143},\n    {\"title\": \"Casino Royale\", \"rating\": 8.0, \"runtime\": 144},\n    {\"title\": \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", \"rating\": 7.8, \"runtime\": 158},\n    {\"title\": \"The Invasion\", \"rating\": 5.9, \"runtime\": 98},\n    # Add more movies here\n]\n\n# Filter movies by runtime\nfiltered_movies = [movie for movie in data if movie[\"runtime\"] < 150]\n\n# Determine the highest rated movie\nhighest_rated_movie = max(filtered_movies, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n\n# Output the highest rated movie\nprint(highest_rated_movie)\n```\n\n### Execution\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the IMDb page for Daniel Craig and extract the data.\n2. **Python Script**: Run the provided script to filter and analyze the data.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Check the availability of the highest-rated movie on Netflix (US).\n4. **Final Verification**: Cross-reference the details to ensure accuracy.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure\n- **Incorrect IMDb Page**: The WebSurfer navigated to the wrong IMDb page (for Bruce Dern instead of Daniel Craig).\n- **Manual Navigation Error**: The manual navigation step to the correct IMDb page for Daniel Craig was not executed correctly.\n- **Data Extraction Issues**: The data extraction process was not automated, leading to incomplete or incorrect data collection.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Correct IMDb Page Navigation**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the correct IMDb page for Daniel Craig (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001136/).\n\n2. **Automate Data Extraction**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down the page to load all of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of movies, their IMDB ratings, and runtimes in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV).\n\n3. **Filter and Analyze Data**:\n   - **Python Script**: Use the provided Python script to filter the list of movies to those that are less than 150 minutes.\n   - **Python Script**: Identify the highest-rated movie from the filtered list.\n\n4. **Check Availability on Netflix (US)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Netflix (US) website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the highest-rated movie from the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm its availability.\n\n5. **Final Verification**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability of the selected movie to ensure all criteria are met.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **Navigate to Correct IMDb Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the IMDb page for Daniel Craig (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001136/).\n\n2. **Scroll Down and Extract Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down the page to load all of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of movies, their IMDB ratings, and runtimes in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV).\n\n3. **Run Python Script to Filter and Analyze Data**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the provided Python script to filter the list of movies to those that are less than 150 minutes and identify the highest-rated movie.\n   ```python\n   import json\n\n   # Sample data structure (to be replaced with actual extracted data)\n   data = [\n       {\"title\": \"Knives Out\", \"rating\": 7.9, \"runtime\": 130},\n       {\"title\": \"Logan Lucky\", \"rating\": 7.0, \"runtime\": 119},\n       {\"title\": \"Skyfall\", \"rating\": 7.8, \"runtime\": 143},\n       {\"title\": \"Casino Royale\", \"rating\": 8.0, \"runtime\": 144},\n       {\"title\": \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", \"rating\": 7.8, \"runtime\": 158},\n       {\"title\": \"The Invasion\", \"rating\": 5.9, \"runtime\": 98},\n       # Add more movies here\n   ]\n\n   # Filter movies by runtime\n   filtered_movies = [movie for movie in data if movie[\"runtime\"] < 150]\n\n   # Determine the highest rated movie\n   highest_rated_movie = max(filtered_movies, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n\n   # Output the highest rated movie\n   print(highest_rated_movie)\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Availability on Netflix (US)**:\n   -

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Let's update the fact sheet to reflect the current situation and include new educated guesses based on the challenges we've encountered.\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of Daniel Craig movies and their respective runtimes.\n   - IMDB ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - Availability of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Filter the list of Daniel Craig's movies to those that are less than 150 minutes.\n   - Determine the highest IMDB rating among the filtered list.\n   - Confirm the availability of the highest-rated movie on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Daniel Craig is known for his role as James Bond, but he has also starred in other notable films.\n   - Some of his non-Bond films, such as \"Knives Out\" and \"Logan Lucky,\" are highly rated and might fit the criteria.\n   - Netflix (US) frequently updates its catalog, so the availability of movies can change.\n   - Based on the IMDb page, \"Knives Out\" (2019) has a high IMDB rating of 7.9 and a runtime of 130 minutes, which fits the criteria. It is a strong candidate and should be checked for availability on Netflix (US).\n   - \"Logan Lucky\" (2017) has a good IMDB rating of 7.0 and a runtime of 119 minutes, making it another potential candidate to check for availability on Netflix (US).\n   - \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" (2011) has a high IMDB rating of 7.8 and a runtime of 158 minutes, which is slightly over the limit but worth checking if it's available on Netflix (US) and if there are any special editions or versions with shorter runtimes.\n   - \"The Invasion\" (2007) has a moderate IMDB rating of 5.9 and a runtime of 98 minutes, making it a potential candidate if higher-rated options are not available.\n   - **New Guess**: Given the issues with navigating to the correct IMDb page, it might be more efficient to use a web search to find a comprehensive list of Daniel Craig's movies, including their IMDB ratings and runtimes, rather than relying solely on the IMDb page.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- \"Knives Out\" and \"Logan Lucky\" remain strong candidates due to their high ratings and suitable runtimes.\n- \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a well-known film and might be available on Netflix (US), even though its runtime is slightly over the limit. Checking for any shorter versions or special editions could be worthwhile.\n- \"The Invasion\" is a less prominent film but meets the runtime requirement and is worth checking for availability on Netflix (US).\n- Using a web search to find a comprehensive list of Daniel Craig's movies can help bypass the navigation issues we encountered with the IMDb page.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Web Search for Comprehensive List**:\n   - Perform a web search to find a reliable source that lists Daniel Craig's movies along with their IMDB ratings and runtimes.\n   - Extract the relevant data from the search results.\n\n2. **Filter and Analyze Data**:\n   - Use Python to filter the list of movies to those that are less than 150 minutes.\n   - Identify the highest-rated movie from the filtered list.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Netflix (US)**:\n   - Navigate to the Netflix (US) website.\n   - Search for the highest-rated movie from the filtered list.\n   - Confirm its availability.\n\n4. **Final Verification**:\n   - Cross-reference the IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability of the selected movie to ensure all criteria are met.\n\n### Python Script for Data Filtering and Analysis\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Sample data structure (to be replaced with actual extracted data)\ndata = [\n    {\"title\": \"Knives Out\", \"rating\": 7.9, \"runtime\": 130},\n    {\"title\": \"Logan Lucky\", \"rating\": 7.0, \"runtime\": 119},\n    {\"title\": \"Skyfall\", \"rating\": 7.8, \"runtime\": 143},\n    {\"title\": \"Casino Royale\", \"rating\": 8.0, \"runtime\": 144},\n    {\"title\": \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", \"rating\": 7.8, \"runtime\": 158},\n    {\"title\": \"The Invasion\", \"rating\": 5.9, \"runtime\": 98},\n    # Add more movies here\n]\n\n# Filter movies by runtime\nfiltered_movies = [movie for movie in data if movie[\"runtime\"] < 150]\n\n# Determine the highest rated movie\nhighest_rated_movie = max(filtered_movies, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n\n# Output the highest rated movie\nprint(highest_rated_movie)\n```\n\n### Execution\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find a comprehensive list of Daniel Craig's movies, including their IMDB ratings and runtimes.\n2. **Python Script**: Run the provided script to filter and analyze the data.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Check the availability of the highest-rated movie on Netflix (US).\n4. **Final Verification**: Cross-reference the details to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet's start by performing a web search to find a comprehensive list of Daniel Craig's movies.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure\n- **Incorrect IMDb Page**: The WebSurfer navigated to the wrong IMDb page (for Bruce Dern instead of Daniel Craig).\n- **Manual Navigation Error**: The manual navigation step to the correct IMDb page for Daniel Craig was not executed correctly.\n- **Data Extraction Issues**: The data extraction process was not automated, leading to incomplete or incorrect data collection.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Perform a Web Search for Daniel Craig's Filmography**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query \"Daniel Craig filmography IMDb\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the first result that leads to the correct IMDb page for Daniel Craig (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0188833/).\n\n2. **Scroll Down and Extract Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down the page to load all of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of movies, their IMDB ratings, and runtimes in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV).\n\n3. **Run Python Script to Filter and Analyze Data**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the provided Python script to filter the list of movies to those that are less than 150 minutes.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Identify the highest-rated movie from the filtered list.\n   ```python\n   import json\n\n   # Sample data structure (to be replaced with actual extracted data)\n   data = [\n       {\"title\": \"Knives Out\", \"rating\": 7.9, \"runtime\": 130},\n       {\"title\": \"Logan Lucky\", \"rating\": 7.0, \"runtime\": 119},\n       {\"title\": \"Skyfall\", \"rating\": 7.8, \"runtime\": 143},\n       {\"title\": \"Casino Royale\", \"rating\": 8.0, \"runtime\": 144},\n       {\"title\": \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", \"rating\": 7.8, \"runtime\": 158},\n       {\"title\": \"The Invasion\", \"rating\": 5.9, \"runtime\": 98},\n       # Add more movies here\n   ]\n\n   # Filter movies by runtime\n   filtered_movies = [movie for movie in data if movie[\"runtime\"] < 150]\n\n   # Determine the highest rated movie\n   highest_rated_movie = max(filtered_movies, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n\n   # Output the highest rated movie\n   print(highest_rated_movie)\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Availability on Netflix (US)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Netflix (US) website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the highest-rated movie from the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm its availability.\n\n5. **Final Verification**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability of the selected movie to ensure all criteria are met.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **Perform a Web Search**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Daniel Craig filmography IMDb\".\n   -
