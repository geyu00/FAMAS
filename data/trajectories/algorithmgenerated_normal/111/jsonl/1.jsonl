(provide the answer in percentage) Please solve the task carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nDetermine the likelihood of hitting a rainy day (at least 0.5mm of precipitation) if traveling to Seattle during the first week of September based on historical data from 2020 to 2023.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Locate and load actual historical weather data for Seattle for the first week of September from 2020 to 2023.\n2. Analyze the data to count the number of rainy days (days with at least 0.5mm of precipitation) during the specified period.\n3. Calculate the probability of hitting a rainy day by dividing the number of rainy days by the total number of days in the first week of September over the four years.\n4. Present the result as a percentage.\n\n## Output format\n- Number of rainy days (at least 0.5mm of precipitation) for each year during the first week of September.\n- Total number of days analyzed.\n- Probability of hitting a rainy day as a percentage.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Use accurate and reliable historical weather data.\n- Ensure the analysis covers the first week of September for each year from 2020 to 2023.\n- Verify the accuracy of the data analysis and probability calculation.\n\n## Results and reason from last response\n- Number of rainy days (>= 0.5mm) for each year during the first week of September:\n  - 2020: 7 rainy days\n  - 2021: 7 rainy days\n  - 2022: 7 rainy days\n  - 2023: 6 rainy days\n- Total number of days analyzed: 28 days\n- Probability of hitting a rainy day: 96.43%\n- The results were based on a mock dataset generated due to the initial failure to locate and load the actual weather data file."}
