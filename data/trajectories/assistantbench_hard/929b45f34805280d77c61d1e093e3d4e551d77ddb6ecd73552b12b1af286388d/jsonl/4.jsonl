{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe dog genome was first mapped in 2004 and has been updated several times since. What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The location or database where these files can be accessed.\n   - Any updates or revisions to the dog genome that occurred between 2004 and May 2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact release date of the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020, if not directly stated in the source.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020 is likely to be one of the more recent assemblies, possibly CanFam3.1 or a later version.\n   - The files are likely to be available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or Ensembl databases, as these are common repositories for genomic data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to search for the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020.\n  - Search query: \"Most recent dog genome assembly as of May 2020\"\n  - Identify the specific version (e.g., CanFam3.1) and the repository where it is hosted (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl).\n\n- **Step 2**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to the identified repository and locate the specific files for the most relevant version of the dog genome.\n  - Navigate to the NCBI or Ensembl website.\n  - Locate the section for the dog genome (Canis lupus familiaris).\n  - Find the specific version released around May 2020.\n\n- **Step 3**: Extract the direct link to the relevant files.\n  - Use WebSurfer to find the download links for the genome files.\n  - Ensure the link is to the most complete and up-to-date version as of May 2020.\n\n- **Step 4**: Verify the link and provide it in the final response.\n  - Double-check the link to ensure it points to the correct files.\n  - Provide the link in the final response along with any additional relevant information."}

Annotation with generated and existing long and short read RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and ATAC-seq, revealed that 32.1% of lifted over CanFam3.1 gaps harboured previously hidden functional elements, including promoters, genes and miRNAs in GSD_1.0. A catalogue of canine “dark” regions was made to facilitate mapping rescue. Alignment in these regions is difficult, but we demonstrate that they harbour trait-associated variation. Key genomic regions were completed, including the Dog Leucocyte Antigen (DLA), T Cell Receptor (TCR) and 366 COSMIC cancer genes. 10x linked-read sequencing of 27 dogs (19 breeds) uncovered 22.1 million SNPs, indels and larger structural variants. Subsequent intersection with protein coding genes showed that 1.4% of these could directly influence gene products, and so provide a source of normal or aberrant phenotypic modifications.\nDownload PDF\nSections\nFigures\nReferences\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nResults and discussion\nMethods\nData availability\nCode availability\nReferences\nAcknowledgements\nFunding\nAuthor information\nEthics declarations\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"mainEntity\": {\n            \"headline\": \"A novel canine reference genome resolves genomic architecture and uncovers transcript complexity\",\n            \"description\": \"We present GSD_1.0, a high-quality domestic dog reference genome with chromosome length scaffolds and contiguity increased 55-fold over CanFam3.1.

Humans and dogs also share orthologous genes, genomic architecture and disease sets, placing the dog as an important comparative species for human genetics and genomics. Taking advantage of pet dog medical records, within breed homogeneity and disease risk enrichment, it has been possible to provide insights into both rare and common spontaneous disease. The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals website (OMIA, June 2020, omia.org) currently catalogues 774 canine traits with linked genetic associations, 234 of which are likely causative in the canine models for human disease. The types of canine variants implicated in disease range from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (e.g. a missense variation in \nSections\nFigures\nReferences\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nResults and discussion\nMethods\nData availability\nCode availability\nReferences\nAcknowledgements\nFunding\nAuthor information\nEthics declarations\nAdditional information\nSupplementary information\nRights and permissions\nAbout this article\nThis article is cited by\nAdvertisement\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe dog genome was first mapped in 2004 and has been updated several times since. What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n   - A novel canine reference genome, GSD_1.0 (canFam4), was published in February 2021, which is an improvement over CanFam3.1 and includes chromosome-length scaffolds and increased contiguity by 55-fold.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The location or database where these files can be accessed.\n   - Any updates or revisions to the dog genome that occurred between 2004 and May 2020.\n   - The exact release date of the GSD_1.0 (canFam4) genome assembly and whether it was available in May 2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact release date of the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020, if not directly stated in the source.\n   - Whether the GSD_1.0 (canFam4) genome assembly was available in May 2020 and if it was considered the most relevant version at that time.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020 is likely to be CanFam3.1, as the GSD_1.0 (canFam4) was published in February 2021, which is after May 2020.\n   - The files for CanFam3.1 are likely to be available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or Ensembl databases, as these are common repositories for genomic data.\n   - The GSD_1.0 (canFam4) genome assembly, while more advanced, was not available in May 2020, so the focus should be on CanFam3.1 for the specified time frame.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- Since the GSD_1.0 (canFam4) was published in February 2021, it was not available in May 2020. Therefore, the most relevant version in May 2020 would have been the latest version available at that time, which is likely CanFam3.1.\n- NCBI and Ensembl are well-known and widely used repositories for genomic data, making them the most probable sources for the CanFam3.1 files.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigation Issues**: The repeated clicks and navigation attempts did not lead to the correct section of the UCSC Genome Browser where the GSD_1.0 (canFam4) dog genome assembly files are located.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: The search terms and navigation paths were not specific enough to directly locate the desired files.\n- **Misinterpretation of Links**: The links clicked did not always lead to the intended destination, causing confusion and delays.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Clarify Search Terms and Navigation Paths**:\n   - Use more specific search terms to directly locate the GSD_1.0 (canFam4) dog genome assembly files.\n   - Clearly define the steps to navigate to the correct section of the UCSC Genome Browser.\n\n2. **Direct Navigation to the Correct Section**:\n   - Start by navigating to the UCSC Genome Browser home page.\n   - Use the search bar to directly search for \"GSD_1.0\" or \"canFam4\".\n   - Click on the relevant link to the GSD_1.0 (canFam4) assembly.\n\n3. **Locate and Extract the Direct Link**:\n   - Once on the correct page, locate the section where the files for the GSD_1.0 (canFam4) assembly are available.\n   - Extract the direct link to the relevant files.\n\n4. **Verify the Link**:\n   - Double-check the link to ensure it points to the correct files.\n   - Provide the link in the final response along with any additional relevant information.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser Home Page**:\n   - Open the UCSC Genome Browser home page: [UCSC Genome Browser Home](https://genome.ucsc.edu/).\n\n2. **Search for GSD_1.0 (canFam4)**:\n   - Use the search bar to search for \"GSD_1.0\" or \"canFam4\".\n   - Click on the relevant link to the GSD_1.0 (canFam4) assembly.\n\n3. **Locate the Files**:\n   - Once on the GSD_1.0 (canFam4) page, locate the section where the files are available for download.\n   - Look for options such as \"FTP\", \"HTTP\", or \"rsync\" to download the files.\n\n4. **Extract the Direct Link**:\n   - Copy the direct link to the relevant files.\n   - Ensure the link is correct and points to the GSD_1.0 (canFam4) assembly files.\n\n5. **Verify the Link**:\n   - Double-check the link to ensure it is valid and accessible.\n   - Provide the link in the final response.\n\n### Execution\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser home page.\n- **Step 2**: Use the search bar to search for \"GSD_1.0\" or \"canFam4\".\n- **Step 3**: Click on the relevant link to the GSD_1.0 (canFam4) assembly.\n- **Step 4**: Locate the section where the files are available for download.\n- **Step 5**: Extract the direct link to the relevant files.\n- **Step 6**: Verify the link and provide it in the final response.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan."}

There is also a \"view table schema\" link on the configuration page for each track. --------------------------------------------------------------- If you plan to download a large file or multiple files from this directory, we recommend you use ftp rather than downloading the files via our website. To do so, ftp to hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu, then go to the directory goldenPath/canFam3/database/. To download multiple files, use the \"mget\" command: mget <filename1> <filename2> ... - or - mget -a (to download all the files in the directory) Alternate methods to ftp access. Using an rsync command to download the entire directory: rsync -avzP rsync://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/canFam3/database/ . For a single file, e.g. gc5BaseBw.txt.gz rsync -avzP rsync://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/canFam3/database/gc5BaseBw.txt.gz .

While the original draft sequence was of good quality, gaps were abundant particularly in promoter regions of the genome, negatively impacting the annotation and study of candidate genes. Here, we present an improved genome build, canFam3.1, which includes 85 MB of novel sequence and now covers 99.8% of the euchromatic portion of the genome. We also present multiple RNA-Sequencing data sets from 10 different canine tissues to catalog ∼175,000 expressed loci. While about 90% of the coding genes previously annotated by EnsEMBL have measurable expression in at least one sample, the number of transcript isoforms detected by our data expands the EnsEMBL annotations by a factor of four. Syntenic comparison with the human genome revealed an additional ∼3,000 loci that are characterized as protein coding in human and were also expressed in the dog, suggesting that those were previously not annotated in the EnsEMBL canine gene set. In addition to ∼20,700 high-confidence protein coding loci, we found ∼4,600 antisense transcripts overlapping exons of protein coding genes, ∼7,200 intergenic multi-exon transcripts without coding potential, likely candidates for long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) and ∼11,000 transcripts were reported by two different library construction methods but did not fit any of the above categories. Of the lincRNAs, about 6,000 have no annotated orthologs in human or mouse. Functional analysis of two novel transcripts with shRNA in a mouse kidney cell line altered cell morphology and motility.

{"agent": "WebSurfer", "content": "The study presents an enhanced version of the canine genome, canFam3.1, which includes 85 MB of novel sequence, covering 99.8% of the euchromatic portion of the genome. This improvement addresses gaps in the previous assembly, particularly in promoter regions, and enhances the accuracy of gene annotation. The researchers also conducted deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on ten different canine tissues to catalog approximately 175,000 expressed loci, expanding the known repertoire of protein-coding genes and non-coding transcripts. They identified around 20,700 high-confidence protein-coding loci, 4,600 antisense transcripts, 7,200 long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), and 11,000 additional transcripts of uncertain classification. The study provides a more comprehensive annotation of the canine genome, including a significant expansion of transcript isoforms and the identification of novel regulatory elements. This resource is expected to aid in understanding the genetic basis of diseases in both dogs and humans."}
