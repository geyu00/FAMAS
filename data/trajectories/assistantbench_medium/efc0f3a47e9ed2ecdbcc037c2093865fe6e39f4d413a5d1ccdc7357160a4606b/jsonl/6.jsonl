Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.).

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Fund.\n   - The transaction fees for the fund are $0.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n   - The Fidelity website has a section for viewing all funds, but it requires confirming the user's role (e.g., Personal Investor, Intermediary, Institutional Investor) before providing access to detailed fund information.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) for each of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or through Fidelity's customer service.\n   - Confirm the user's role as a Personal Investor to gain access to the detailed fund information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each fund over the specified period, which will require calculating the change in value from May 2019 to May 2024 and then converting it into a percentage.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Fidelity likely has multiple international emerging markets equity mutual funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance of these funds can vary significantly based on market conditions and investment strategies.\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, some funds may have experienced negative returns or very low positive returns during the specified period.\n   - Navigating the Fidelity website as a Personal Investor might provide the necessary detailed information about the funds, including performance data and transaction fees.\n   - It might be useful to check the \"Fund pricing and performance\" section on the Fidelity website for the required data.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Navigating as a Personal Investor:** Since the website requires confirming the user's role, navigating as a Personal Investor is a logical step to access the detailed fund information.\n- **Checking the \"Fund pricing and performance\" section:** This section is likely to contain the historical performance data needed to calculate the percentage increase for each fund over the specified period.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation Path:** The previous attempts did not correctly navigate to the specific section of the Fidelity website that lists all mutual funds, particularly the International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees.\n2. **User Role Confirmation:** The Fidelity website requires confirming the user's role (e.g., Personal Investor) to access detailed fund information, which was not done in the previous attempts.\n3. **Lack of Specific Search Terms:** The search terms used were too broad, leading to irrelevant results or incomplete information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Fidelity Website:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Fidelity website at `https://www.fidelity.com.hk/en`.\n\n2. **Confirm User Role:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Personal Investors\" to confirm the user role and proceed to the main site.\n\n3. **Navigate to the Funds Section:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the \"Funds\" section from the main menu.\n\n4. **Find the International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for the category or filter for \"International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Apply the filter for funds with $0 transaction fees.\n\n5. **Collect Fund Names and Performance Data:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified fund, navigate to its detailed performance page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the performance data from May 2019 to May 2024, specifically the percentage increase.\n\n6. **Calculate Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each fund using the collected data.\n\n7. **Determine the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the calculated percentage increases and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n8. **Present the Final Result:**\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the corresponding percentage increase value.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Open the Fidelity Website:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open `https://www.fidelity.com.hk/en`.\n\n2. **Confirm User Role:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Personal Investors\" to confirm the user role.\n\n3. **Navigate to the Funds Section:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Funds\" in the main menu.\n\n4. **Find the International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for the category or filter for \"International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Apply the filter for funds with $0 transaction fees.\n\n5. **Collect Fund Names and Performance Data:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified fund, navigate to its detailed performance page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the performance data from May 2019 to May 2024, specifically the percentage increase.\n\n6. **Calculate Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each fund.\n   ```python\n   def calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n       return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\n   # Example data\n   funds = {\n       \"Fund A\": {\"May 2019\": 100, \"May 2024\": 120},\n       \"Fund B\": {\"May 2019\": 150, \"May 2024\": 160},\n       \"Fund C\": {\"May 2019\": 200, \"May 2024\": 210}\n   }\n\n   percentages = {fund: calculate_percentage_increase(data[\"May 2019\"], data[\"May 2024\"]) for fund, data in funds.items()}\n   print(percentages)\n   ```\n\n7. **Determine the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   ```python\n   lowest_increase_fund = min(percentages, key=percentages.get)\n   lowest_increase_value = percentages[lowest_increase_fund]\n   print(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with a {lowest_increase_value:.2f}% increase.\")\n   ```\n\n8. **Present the Final Result:**\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final result.\n   ```python\n   print(f\"The Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Fund with $0 transaction fees that had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024 is {lowest_increase_fund} with a {lowest_increase_value:.2f}% increase.\")\n   ```\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to successfully identify the required fund and present the correct information."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Fund.\n- The transaction fees for the fund are $0.\n- The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n- The Fidelity website has a section for viewing all funds, but it requires confirming the user's role (e.g., Personal Investor, Intermediary, Institutional Investor) before providing access to detailed fund information.\n- We have confirmed the user role as a Personal Investor and navigated to the \"Fund pricing and performance\" section.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The list of Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees.\n- The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) for each of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or through Fidelity's customer service.\n- The \"Asset class\" filter needs to be applied to narrow down the search to equity funds, and then further filtered to \"International Emerging Markets.\"\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The percentage increase for each fund over the specified period, which will require calculating the change in value from May 2019 to May 2024 and then converting it into a percentage.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Fidelity likely has multiple international emerging markets equity mutual funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.\n- The performance of these funds can vary significantly based on market conditions and investment strategies.\n- Given the volatility of emerging markets, some funds may have experienced negative returns or very low positive returns during the specified period.\n- Navigating the Fidelity website as a Personal Investor is necessary to access the detailed fund information, including performance data and transaction fees.\n- The \"Fund pricing and performance\" section is likely to contain the historical performance data needed to calculate the percentage increase for each fund over the specified period.\n- The \"Asset class\" filter should be set to \"Equity Fund\" and then further refined to \"International Emerging Markets\" to find the relevant funds.\n- The performance data for the funds might be available in a downloadable format, such as a CSV or PDF, which could simplify the data collection process.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Asset Class Filter:** Applying the \"Asset class\" filter to \"Equity Fund\" and then further refining it to \"International Emerging Markets\" will help us narrow down the list of relevant funds.\n- **Performance Data Format:** If the performance data is available in a downloadable format, it will make it easier to collect and process the data using Python scripts.\n- **Detailed Filters:** Using detailed filters will ensure that we only look at the specific funds of interest, reducing the amount of irrelevant data.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Apply the Filters:**\n   - Set the \"Asset class\" filter to \"Equity Fund.\"\n   - Further refine the filter to \"International Emerging Markets.\"\n   - Apply the filter for funds with $0 transaction fees.\n\n2. **Collect Fund Names and Performance Data:**\n   - For each identified fund, navigate to its detailed performance page.\n   - Extract the performance data from May 2019 to May 2024, specifically the percentage increase.\n\n3. **Calculate Percentage Increase:**\n   - Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each fund using the collected data.\n\n4. **Determine the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase:**\n   - Compare the calculated percentage increases and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n5. **Present the Final Result:**\n   - Provide the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the corresponding percentage increase value.\n\nLet's proceed with applying the filters to find the relevant funds.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Filter Application:**\n   - The filter for 'International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds' was not correctly applied, leading to a list of all equity funds rather than the specific subset we need.\n\n2. **Incomplete Data Collection:**\n   - The performance data from May 2019 to May 2024 was not collected for the relevant funds, making it impossible to calculate the percentage increase.\n\n3. **Lack of Detailed Navigation:**\n   - The navigation to the specific fund pages was not completed, which is necessary to extract the detailed performance data.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Fidelity Website:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open `https://www.fidelity.com.hk/en`.\n\n2. **Confirm User Role:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Personal Investors\" to confirm the user role.\n\n3. **Navigate to the Funds Section:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Funds\" in the main menu.\n\n4. **Navigate to Fund Pricing and Performance:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Fund pricing and performance\" in the Funds section.\n\n5. **Apply Filters:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Apply the filter for \"Equity Fund\" under \"Asset class.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Apply the filter for \"International Emerging Markets\" under \"Region.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Apply the filter for \"$0 transaction fees\" if available.\n\n6. **Collect Fund Names and Performance Data:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified fund, navigate to its detailed performance page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the performance data from May 2019 to May 2024, specifically the percentage increase.\n\n7. **Calculate Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each fund using the collected data.\n   ```python\n   def calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n       return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\n   # Example data\n   funds = {\n       \"Fund A\": {\"May 2019\": 100, \"May 2024\": 120},\n       \"Fund B\": {\"May 2019\": 150, \"May 2024\": 160},\n       \"Fund C\": {\"May 2019\": 200, \"May 2024\": 210}\n   }\n\n   percentages = {fund: calculate_percentage_increase(data[\"May 2019\"], data[\"May 2024\"]) for fund, data in funds.items()}\n   print(percentages)\n   ```\n\n8. **Determine the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   ```python\n   lowest_increase_fund = min(percentages, key=percentages.get)\n   lowest_increase_value = percentages[lowest_increase_fund]\n   print(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with a {lowest_increase_value:.2f}% increase.\")\n   ```\n\n9. **Present the Final Result:**\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final result.\n   ```python\n   print(f\"The Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Fund with $0 transaction fees that had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024 is {lowest_increase_fund} with a {lowest_increase_value:.2f}% increase.\")\n   ```\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Open the Fidelity Website:**\n   -

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser.

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Fund.\n- The transaction fees for the fund are $0.\n- The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n- The Fidelity website has a section for viewing all funds, but it requires confirming the user's role (e.g., Personal Investor, Intermediary, Institutional Investor) before providing access to detailed fund information.\n- We have confirmed the user role as a Personal Investor and navigated to the \"Fund pricing and performance\" section.\n- The \"Asset class\" filter is available and can be set to \"Equity Fund.\"\n- The \"Region\" filter is available and can be set to \"International Emerging Markets.\"\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The list of Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 transaction fees.\n- The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) for each of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or through Fidelity's customer service.\n- The \"Transaction fees\" filter needs to be applied to narrow down the search to funds with $0 transaction fees.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The percentage increase for each fund over the specified period, which will require calculating the change in value from May 2019 to May 2024 and then converting it into a percentage.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Fidelity likely has multiple international emerging markets equity mutual funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.\n- The performance of these funds can vary significantly based on market conditions and investment strategies.\n- Given the volatility of emerging markets, some funds may have experienced negative returns or very low positive returns during the specified period.\n- Navigating the Fidelity website as a Personal Investor is necessary to access the detailed fund information, including performance data and transaction fees.\n- The \"Fund pricing and performance\" section is likely to contain the historical performance data needed to calculate the percentage increase for each fund over the specified period.\n- The performance data for the funds might be available in a downloadable format, such as a CSV or PDF, which could simplify the data collection process.\n- The \"Transaction fees\" filter might be nested within the \"Fund Information\" or \"Fund Comparison\" sections, requiring additional navigation to locate.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Transaction Fees Filter:** The transaction fees filter might be less prominent or nested within another section, which could explain why it hasn't been easily located yet.\n- **Performance Data Format:** If the performance data is available in a downloadable format, it will make it easier to collect and process the data using Python scripts.\n- **Detailed Filters:** Using detailed filters will ensure that we only look at the specific funds of interest, reducing the amount of irrelevant data.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Apply the Filters:**\n   - Set the \"Asset class\" filter to \"Equity Fund.\"\n   - Further refine the filter to \"International Emerging Markets.\"\n   - Look for the \"Transaction fees\" filter, which might be nested within the \"Fund Information\" or \"Fund Comparison\" sections.\n\n2. **Collect Fund Names and Performance Data:**\n   - For each identified fund, navigate to its detailed performance page.\n   - Extract the performance data from May 2019 to May 2024, specifically the percentage increase.\n\n3. **Calculate Percentage Increase:**\n   - Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each fund using the collected data.\n   ```python\n   def calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n       return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\n   # Example data\n   funds = {\n       \"Fund A\": {\"May 2019\": 100, \"May 2024\": 120},\n       \"Fund B\": {\"May 2019\": 150, \"May 2024\": 160},\n       \"Fund C\": {\"May 2019\": 200, \"May 2024\": 210}\n   }\n\n   percentages = {fund: calculate_percentage_increase(data[\"May 2019\"], data[\"May 2024\"]) for fund, data in funds.items()}\n   print(percentages)\n   ```\n\n4. **Determine the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase:**\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   ```python\n   lowest_increase_fund = min(percentages, key=percentages.get)\n   lowest_increase_value = percentages[lowest_increase_fund]\n   print(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with a {lowest_increase_value:.2f}% increase.\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Present the Final Result:**\n   - Provide the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the corresponding percentage increase value.\n   ```python\n   print(f\"The Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Fund with $0 transaction fees that had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024 is {lowest_increase_fund} with a {lowest_increase_value:.2f}% increase.\")\n   ```\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **Apply the Filters:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the \"Asset class\" filter to \"Equity Fund.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Further refine the filter to \"International Emerging Markets.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for the \"Transaction fees\" filter, which might be nested within the \"Fund Information\" or \"Fund Comparison\" sections.\n\n2. **Collect Fund Names and Performance Data:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified fund, navigate to its detailed performance page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the performance data from May 2019 to May 2024, specifically the percentage increase.\n\n3. **Calculate Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each fund.\n   ```python\n   def calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n       return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\n   # Example data\n   funds = {\n       \"Fund A\": {\"May 2019\": 100, \"May 2024\": 120},\n       \"Fund B\": {\"May 2019\": 150, \"May 2024\": 160},\n       \"Fund C\": {\"May 2019\": 200, \"May 2024\": 210}\n   }\n\n   percentages = {fund: calculate_percentage_increase(data[\"May 2019\"], data[\"May 2024\"]) for fund, data in funds.items()}\n   print(percentages)\n   ```\n\n4. **Determine the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   ```python\n   lowest_increase_fund = min(percentages, key=percentages.get)\n   lowest_increase_value = percentages[lowest_increase_fund]\n   print(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with a {lowest_increase_value:.2f}% increase.\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Present the Final Result:**\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final result.\n   ```python\n   print(f\"The Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Fund with $0 transaction fees that had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024 is {lowest_increase_fund} with a {lowest_increase_value:.2f}% increase.\")\n   ```\n\nBy following this updated plan, we should be able to successfully identify the required fund and present the correct information. Let's start by applying the filters to find the relevant funds. \n\n**Action:**\n- **WebSurfer**: Set the \"Asset class\" filter to \"Equity Fund.\"\n- **WebSurfer**: Further refine the filter to \"International Emerging Markets.\"\n- **WebSurfer**: Look for the \"Transaction fees\" filter, which might be nested within the \"Fund Information\" or \"Fund Comparison\" sections.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Filter Application:**\n   - The filter for 'International Emerging Markets' was not correctly applied, leading to a list of all equity funds rather than the specific subset we need.\n\n2. **Incomplete Data Collection:**\n   - The performance data from May 2019 to May 2024 was not collected for the relevant funds, making it impossible to calculate the percentage increase.\n\n3. **Lack of Detailed Navigation:**\n   - The navigation to the specific fund pages was not completed, which is necessary to extract the detailed performance data.\n\n4. **Missing Transaction Fees Filter:**\n   - The filter for $0 transaction fees was not located or applied, which is crucial for narrowing down the list of funds.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Fidelity Website:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open `https://www.fidelity.com.hk/en`.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm the user role as a Personal Investor.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Funds Section:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Funds\" in the main menu.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Fund pricing and performance\" in the Funds section.\n\n3. **Apply Filters:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the \"Asset class\" filter to \"Equity Fund.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Set the \"Region\" filter to \"International Emerging Markets.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for and apply the \"Transaction fees\" filter to select funds with $0 transaction fees.
