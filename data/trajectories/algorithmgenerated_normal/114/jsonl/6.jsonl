{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "To tackle the task of verifying the correctness of the sample dataset and the function for finding the smallest house with at least 2 beds and 2 baths in Prince Edward Island, I will follow the outlined plan.\n\n### Step 1: Review the Sample Dataset\n1. **Check Dataset Structure**: The dataset should include the following columns: `square_footage`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `location`, and `sale_date`.\n2. **Representativeness**: I will examine if the dataset contains sufficient entries within the specified date range (June 1, 2022, to May 15, 2024), as well as if it reflects a variety of properties sold in Prince Edward Island.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Function\n1. **Examine Filtering Criteria**: The function should accurately filter properties based on `bedrooms >= 2`, `bathrooms >= 2`, and the date range.\n2. **Smallest House Identification**: Once filtered, the function must find the house with the minimum `square_footage` among the filtered results.\n\n### Verification Process\nI need to gather the sample dataset and the code for the function used to perform the filtering and identification of the smallest house. \n\nCould you please provide the sample dataset and the code for the function so that I can carry out the verification?"}
