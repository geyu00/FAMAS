THE MAZE - NIGHT.\"\n- This matches the exact requirement of presenting the location as it appears in the official script.\n\nNow, I will verify the consistency and correctness of this information before moving forward with the validation process. I suggest we cross-reference with any available script databases or official episode recaps to confirm that \"THE MAZE\" is indeed the correct setting mentioned in the first scene heading.\n\nLet's proceed with the validation to confirm the accuracy of this setting.
