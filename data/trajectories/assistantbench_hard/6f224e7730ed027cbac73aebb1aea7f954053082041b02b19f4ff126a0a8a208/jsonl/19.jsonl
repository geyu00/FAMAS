Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information we have gathered:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO (Initial Public Offering) in October 2020.\n   - The request is specifically about members of Fubo's Management Team who joined the company during the same year as the IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The names and joining years of the current members of Fubo's Management Team.\n   - These facts can be found on Fubo's official website, SEC filings, press releases, and corporate news articles.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the year each management team member joined the company with the year of Fubo's IPO (2020) to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that Fubo's IPO occurred in 2020, it is likely that some key executives joined the company around this time to support the transition to a publicly traded company.\n   - Specific roles such as CFO and CLO might have been filled or reinforced around the time of the IPO to ensure strong financial and legal oversight during this critical period.\n   - David Gandler, as CEO, has been with the company since its founding in 2015, and Alberto Horihuela, as COO, has been with the company since its founding in 2015. Therefore, they did not join in 2020.\n   - Gina DiGioia, the Chief Legal Officer, joined the company in 2020 as the first in-house general counsel, which aligns with the IPO year.\n   - John Janedis, the Chief Financial Officer, has over two decades of financial expertise and likely joined the company to support the IPO and subsequent financial operations. His joining year needs to be confirmed.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Fubo's official website or other reliable sources to find the specific joining years for John Janedis and any other members of the management team.\n- **Assistant**: Once the joining years are confirmed, cross-reference them with the IPO year (2020) to identify the relevant team members.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Lack of Specific Information Extraction**: Despite navigating to the management team page, we did not explicitly extract and verify the joining years of the management team members.\n- **Inefficient Use of WebSurfer**: We did not utilize the WebSurfer's ability to scroll through the page and extract specific details effectively.\n- **Insufficient Cross-Referencing**: We did not systematically cross-reference the joining years with the IPO year once the information was available.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Extract Joining Years for Each Management Team Member**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the \"Fubo - Governance - Management Team\" page and scroll through the page to find the detailed profiles of each management team member.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Extract the specific joining years for each member from their profiles.\n- **Cross-Reference Joining Years with IPO Year**:\n  - **Assistant**: Once the joining years are extracted, cross-reference them with the IPO year (2020) to identify those who joined in the same year.\n- **Compile and Present the Results**:\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide a list of the management team members who joined Fubo in the same year as its IPO.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the Management Team Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the \"Fubo - Governance - Management Team\" page: [Fubo - Governance - Management Team](https://ir.fubo.tv/governance/management-team/default.aspx).\n\n2. **Scroll Through the Page and Extract Joining Years**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the page to view the detailed profiles of each management team member.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the specific joining years for each member from their profiles.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference Joining Years with IPO Year**:\n   - **Assistant**: Once the joining years are extracted, compare them with the IPO year (2020) to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n4. **Compile and Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide a list of the management team members who joined Fubo in 2020.\n\n### Execution:\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the \"Fubo - Governance - Management Team\" page and start extracting the joining years for each member."}
