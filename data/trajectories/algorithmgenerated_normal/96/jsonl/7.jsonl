Calculate the absolute difference in tens of thousands between the two population figures, assuming two penguins per breeding pair.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Retrieve the population data for chinstrap penguins from the Wikipedia page for penguin species populations as of the end of 2018.\n2. Retrieve the population data for chinstrap penguins from the Nature.com article \"Global population assessment of the Chinstrap penguin\" from 2020.\n3. Convert the population data from breeding pairs to individual penguins by assuming two penguins per breeding pair.\n4. Calculate the absolute difference in the population data between the two sources.\n5. Convert this difference into tens of thousands.\n\n## Output format\nThe absolute difference in tens of thousands between the population figures from the two sources.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure the data is accurately retrieved from the specified sources.\n- Ensure the conversion from breeding pairs to individual penguins is correctly applied.\n- Ensure the absolute difference is correctly calculated and converted into tens of thousands.\n\n## Results from last response\n- URL used for final correct Wikipedia page: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sphenisciformes_by_population\"\n- Code snippets for data extraction and filtering were shared."}
