Each season has one winner. Thus, the number of unique winners for Survivor is equal to the number of seasons, which is 44.\n\n2. **Winners of American Idol:**\n   American Idol premiered in 2002 and has completed 21 seasons as of 2023. Each season has one winner, meaning there have been 21 unique winners.\n\nNow I will calculate the difference in the number of unique winners between Survivor and American Idol:\n\n- **Number of Unique Winners in Survivor:** 44\n- **Number of Unique Winners in American Idol:** 21\n\nNow I will perform the subtraction:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Winners of Survivor} - \\text{Winners of American Idol} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 44 - 21 \\]\n\nLet's execute the calculation. \n\n```python\n# Calculating the difference in the number of unique winners between Survivor and American Idol\nsurvivor_winners = 44\namerican_idol_winners = 21\n\ndifference = survivor_winners - american_idol_winners\nprint(difference)\n```"}
