I will first check if there is a database or an API that provides information about Christgau's reviews, or I will proceed with known data for these albums. \n\nAs of now, I'm aware that:\n- Robert Christgau did give a letter grade to Fiona Apple's *Tidal*.\n- Paula Cole's *Harbinger* is known not to have received a letter grade from him.\n\nTherefore, our current list of albums is as follows:\n- *Tidal* (received a letter grade)\n- *Harbinger* (did not receive a letter grade)\n\n### Step 3: Filter out the albums\n\nSince *Harbinger* did not receive a letter grade and *Tidal* did, we will keep *Harbinger* in our final list.\n\n### Step 4: Sort the remaining albums\n\nNow that we have one album, we simply need to format it into a comma-delimited list.\n\n### Final Output\n\nThe final output list of albums released by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole before 1999 that did not receive a letter grade from Robert Christgau is:\n\n*Harbinger*\n\nNow, I will present this result in the required format:\n\n```\nHarbinger\n``` \n\nPlease confirm if this meets your expectations or if any further verification is needed."}
