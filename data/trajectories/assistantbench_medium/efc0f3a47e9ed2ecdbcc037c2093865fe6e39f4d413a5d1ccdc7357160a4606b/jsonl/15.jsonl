{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - The transaction fees associated with each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each eligible fund at the start (May 2019) and end (May 2024) of the specified period.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial databases like Morningstar, or other reputable financial news and data platforms.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund using the formula: \\(\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{End Value} - \\text{Start Value}}{\\text{Start Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\).\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculated values.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is likely that some funds may have experienced negative returns or very low positive returns during the specified period.\n   - Fidelity often offers multiple funds within the same category, so there could be several options to consider.\n   - The performance of these funds can be influenced by various factors such as market conditions, management strategies, and geopolitical events, but without specific data, these are just educated guesses.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nCertainly! Here’s a concise plan to address the original request:\n\n1. **Identify Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds with $0 Transaction Fees:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find a list of Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Fidelity’s official website or a reputable financial data platform to filter the funds by $0 transaction fees.\n\n2. **Collect Historical Data (May 2019 to May 2024):**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified fund, collect the net asset value (NAV) or share price for May 2019 and May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the data is accurate and from a reliable source.\n\n3. **Calculate Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each fund using the collected data.\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to perform the calculations and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n4. **Verify and Report:**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the results and prepare a final report.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the calculated percentage increase.\n\n### Detailed Plan:\n\n- **Step 1: Web Search and Filtering**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\"\n  - **WebSurfer**: Filter the results to include only those with $0 transaction fees.\n\n- **Step 2: Collect Historical Data**\n  - **WebSurfer**: For each fund, navigate to its historical performance page.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Record the NAV or share price for May 2019 and May 2024.\n\n- **Step 3: Calculate Percentage Increase**\n  - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each fund.\n  - **Assistant**: Run the script to identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify and Report**\n  - **Assistant**: Verify the accuracy of the calculations.\n  - **Assistant**: Prepare a final report with the name of the fund and the percentage increase.\n\n### Python Script Example:\n```python\n# Sample Python script to calculate percentage increase\nfunds = {\n    'Fund A': {'May_2019': 100, 'May_2024': 120},\n    'Fund B': {'May_2019': 150, 'May_2024': 160},\n    'Fund C': {'May_2019': 200, 'May_2024': 210}\n}\n\ndef calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n    return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\nresults = {}\nfor fund, values in funds.items():\n    start_value = values['May_2019']\n    end_value = values['May_2024']\n    percentage_increase = calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value)\n    results[fund] = percentage_increase\n\n# Find the fund with the lowest percentage increase\nlowest_increase_fund = min(results, key=results.get)\nlowest_increase_value = results[lowest_increase_fund]\n\nprint(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with an increase of {lowest_increase_value:.2f}%.\")\n```\n\nThis plan ensures that we efficiently gather the necessary data, perform the required calculations, and provide a clear and accurate answer to the request."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the current information and any new insights:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n   - Fidelity International offers a variety of investment solutions and has a presence in multiple regions, including the United Kingdom.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - The transaction fees associated with each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each eligible fund at the start (May 2019) and end (May 2024) of the specified period.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial databases like Morningstar, or other reputable financial news and data platforms.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund using the formula: \\(\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{End Value} - \\text{Start Value}}{\\text{Start Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\).\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculated values.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is likely that some funds may have experienced negative returns or very low positive returns during the specified period.\n   - Fidelity often offers multiple funds within the same category, so there could be several options to consider.\n   - The performance of these funds can be influenced by various factors such as market conditions, management strategies, and geopolitical events, but without specific data, these are just educated guesses.\n   - **New Guess**: Since we are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase, it is possible that the fund with the lowest performance might be one that has been more conservative in its investment approach, focusing on stability rather than high growth. This could be a fund that invests in a broader range of emerging markets rather than concentrating on high-growth but high-risk sectors.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n\n1. **Navigate to Fidelity International Website:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to the Fidelity International website and navigate to the section that lists all Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Filter the results to include only those with $0 transaction fees.\n\n2. **Collect Historical Data:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified fund, collect the net asset value (NAV) or share price for May 2019 and May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the data is accurate and from a reliable source.\n\n3. **Calculate Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each fund using the collected data.\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to perform the calculations and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n4. **Verify and Report:**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the results and prepare a final report.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the calculated percentage increase.\n\n### Python Script Example:\n```python\n# Sample Python script to calculate percentage increase\nfunds = {\n    'Fund A': {'May_2019': 100, 'May_2024': 120},\n    'Fund B': {'May_2019': 150, 'May_2024': 160},\n    'Fund C': {'May_2019': 200, 'May_2024': 210}\n}\n\ndef calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n    return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\nresults = {}\nfor fund, values in funds.items():\n    start_value = values['May_2019']\n    end_value = values['May_2024']\n    percentage_increase = calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value)\n    results[fund] = percentage_increase\n\n# Find the fund with the lowest percentage increase\nlowest_increase_fund = min(results, key=results.get)\nlowest_increase_value = results[lowest_increase_fund]\n\nprint(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with an increase of {lowest_increase_value:.2f}%.\")\n```\n\nThis updated plan and fact sheet should help us efficiently gather the necessary data, perform the required calculations, and provide a clear and accurate answer to the request.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The previous attempts to navigate to the Fidelity International website and find the relevant funds were not successful. Specifically, clicking on PDF links or navigating to the wrong sections of the website did not lead to the desired list of funds.\n2. **Lack of Specific Search**: The search queries used were too broad or not specific enough to directly lead to the list of Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n3. **Inefficient Data Collection**: The process of collecting historical data (May 2019 to May 2024) was not clearly defined or executed, leading to incomplete or incorrect data.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Navigate to Fidelity International Website:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to the Fidelity International website (https://www.fidelityinternational.com).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Select 'United Kingdom' as the location.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Funds' section.\n\n2. **Search for Relevant Funds:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search function on the Fidelity International website to search for \"Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Filter the results to include only those with $0 transaction fees.\n\n3. **Collect Fund List:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and identifiers (e.g., ISIN codes) of the relevant funds.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the list is comprehensive and accurate.\n\n4. **Collect Historical Data:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each fund, navigate to its historical performance page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the net asset value (NAV) or share price for May 2019 and May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the data is accurate and from a reliable source.\n\n5. **Calculate Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each fund using the collected data.\n   - **Assistant**: Run the script to identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n6. **Verify and Report:**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the results and prepare a final report.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the calculated percentage increase.\n\n### Python Script Example:\n```python\n# Sample Python script to calculate percentage increase\nfunds = {\n    'Fund A': {'May_2019': 100, 'May_2024': 120},\n    'Fund B': {'May_2019': 150, 'May_2024': 160},\n    'Fund C': {'May_2019': 200, 'May_2024': 210}\n}\n\ndef calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n    return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\nresults = {}\nfor fund, values in funds.items():\n    start_value = values['May_2019']\n    end_value = values['May_2024']\n    percentage_increase = calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value)\n    results[fund] = percentage_increase\n\n# Find the fund with the lowest percentage increase\nlowest_increase_fund = min(results, key=results.get)\nlowest_increase_value = results[lowest_increase_fund]\n\nprint(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with an increase of {lowest_increase_value:.2f}%.\")\n```\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes:\n- **Specific Search Queries**: Use more specific search terms like \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds UK\" to narrow down the results.\n- **Direct Navigation**: Directly navigate to the 'Funds' section and use the filters provided on the website to find the relevant funds.\n- **Data Verification**: Double-check the accuracy of the historical data collected to ensure it is from the correct time periods and sources.\n- **Detailed Instructions**: Provide detailed instructions to the WebSurfer to ensure they navigate and extract data correctly."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the current information and any new insights:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n   - Fidelity International offers a variety of investment solutions and has a presence in multiple regions, including the United Kingdom.\n   - The Fidelity International website for the United Kingdom is accessible at https://www.fidelity.co.uk/.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - The transaction fees associated with each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each eligible fund at the start (May 2019) and end (May 2024) of the specified period.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial databases like Morningstar, or other reputable financial news and data platforms.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund using the formula: \\(\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{End Value} - \\text{Start Value}}{\\text{Start Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\).\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculated values.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is likely that some funds may have experienced negative returns or very low positive returns during the specified period.\n   - Fidelity often offers multiple funds within the same category, so there could be several options to consider.\n   - The performance of these funds can be influenced by various factors such as market conditions, management strategies, and geopolitical events, but without specific data, these are just educated guesses.\n   - **New Guess**: Since we are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase, it is possible that the fund with the lowest performance might be one that has been more conservative in its investment approach, focusing on stability rather than high growth. This could be a fund that invests in a broader range of emerging markets rather than concentrating on high-growth but high-risk sectors.\n   - **Additional Guess**: The fund with the lowest percentage increase might also be one that has a higher focus on risk management and diversification, which could have helped it weather market downturns better than more aggressive funds.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n\n1. **Navigate to Fidelity International Website:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to the Fidelity International website (https://www.fidelity.co.uk/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Funds' section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search function to look for 'Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Apply the filter for $0 transaction fees.\n\n2. **Collect Historical Data:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified fund, collect the net asset value (NAV) or share price for May 2019 and May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the data is accurate and from a reliable source.\n\n3. **Calculate Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each fund using the collected data.\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to perform the calculations and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n4. **Verify and Report:**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the results and prepare a final report.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the calculated percentage increase.\n\n### Python Script Example:\n```python\n# Sample Python script to calculate percentage increase\nfunds = {\n    'Fund A': {'May_2019': 100, 'May_2024': 120},\n    'Fund B': {'May_2019': 150, 'May_2024': 160},\n    'Fund C': {'May_2019': 200, 'May_2024': 210}\n}\n\ndef calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n    return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\nresults = {}\nfor fund, values in funds.items():\n    start_value = values['May_2019']\n    end_value = values['May_2024']\n    percentage_increase = calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value)\n    results[fund] = percentage_increase\n\n# Find the fund with the lowest percentage increase\nlowest_increase_fund = min(results, key=results.get)\nlowest_increase_value = results[lowest_increase_fund]\n\nprint(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with an increase of {lowest_increase_value:.2f}%.\")\n```\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **WebSurfer**: Go to the Fidelity International website (https://www.fidelity.co.uk/).\n2. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Funds' section.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Use the search function to look for 'Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds'.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Apply the filter for $0 transaction fees.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Collect the names and identifiers (e.g., ISIN codes) of the relevant funds.\n6. **WebSurfer**: For each identified fund, collect the net asset value (NAV) or share price for May 2019 and May 2024.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to gather the necessary data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The WebSurfer did not successfully navigate to the 'Funds' section and apply the necessary filters to find the relevant mutual funds.\n2. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided were not detailed enough to guide the WebSurfer through the specific steps required to find the list of Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n3. **Inefficient Data Collection**: The process of collecting historical data (May 2019 to May 2024) was not clearly defined or executed, leading to incomplete or incorrect data.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Navigate to Fidelity International Website:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to the Fidelity International website (https://www.fidelity.co.uk/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the location is set to 'United Kingdom'.\n\n2. **Navigate to the 'Funds' Section:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on 'Funds' in the main navigation menu.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure you are in the 'Funds' section.\n\n3. **Search for Relevant Funds:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search function to look for 'Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Apply the filter for $0 transaction fees.\n\n4. **Collect Fund List:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and identifiers (e.g., ISIN codes) of the relevant funds.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the list is comprehensive and accurate.\n\n5. **Collect Historical Data:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified fund, navigate to its historical performance page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the net asset value (NAV) or share price for May 2019 and May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the data is accurate and from a reliable source.\n\n6. **Calculate Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each fund using the collected data.\n   - **Assistant**: Run the script to identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n7. **Verify and Report:**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the results and prepare a final report.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the calculated percentage increase.\n\n### Detailed Instructions for WebSurfer:\n1. **Navigate to Fidelity International Website:**\n   - Open the web browser and go to https://www.fidelity.co.uk/.\n   - Ensure the location is set to 'United Kingdom'.\n\n2. **Navigate to the 'Funds' Section:**\n   - Click on 'Funds' in the main navigation menu.\n   - Ensure you are in the 'Funds' section.\n\n3. **Search for Relevant Funds:**\n   - Use the search function to look for 'Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds'.\n   - Apply the filter for $0 transaction fees.\n\n4. **Collect Fund List:**\n   - Extract the names and identifiers (e.g., ISIN codes) of the relevant funds.\n   - Ensure the list is comprehensive and accurate.\n\n5. **Collect Historical Data:**\n   - For each identified fund, navigate to its historical performance page.\n   - Record the net asset value (NAV) or share price for May 2019 and May 2024.\n   - Ensure the data is accurate and from a reliable source.\n\n### Python Script Example:\n```python\n# Sample Python script to calculate percentage increase\nfunds = {\n    'Fund A': {'May_2019': 100, 'May_2024': 120},\n    'Fund B': {'May_2019': 150, 'May_2024': 160},\n    'Fund C': {'May_2019': 200, 'May_2024': 210}\n}\n\ndef calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n    return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\nresults = {}\nfor fund, values in funds.items():\n    start_value = values['May_2019']\n    end_value = values['May_2024']\n    percentage_increase = calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value)\n    results[fund] = percentage_increase\n\n# Find the fund with the lowest percentage increase\nlowest_increase_fund = min(results, key=results.get)\nlowest_increase_value = results[lowest_increase_fund]\n\nprint(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with an increase of {lowest_increase_value:.2f}%.\")\n```\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes:\n- **Specific Search Terms**: Use specific search terms like \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds UK\" to narrow down the results.\n- **Direct Navigation**: Directly navigate to the 'Funds' section and use the filters provided on the website to find the relevant funds.\n- **Data Verification**: Double-check the accuracy of the historical data collected to ensure it is from the correct time periods and sources.\n- **Detailed Instructions**: Provide detailed instructions to the WebSurfer to ensure they navigate and extract data correctly."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual fund.\n- The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n- The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n- Fidelity International offers a variety of investment solutions and has a presence in multiple regions, including the United Kingdom.\n- The Fidelity International website for the United Kingdom is accessible at https://www.fidelity.co.uk/.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- A comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n- The transaction fees associated with each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n- The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each eligible fund at the start (May 2019) and end (May 2024) of the specified period.\n- These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial databases like Morningstar, or other reputable financial news and data platforms.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund using the formula: \\(\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{End Value} - \\text{Start Value}}{\\text{Start Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\).\n- Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculated values.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is likely that some funds may have experienced negative returns or very low positive returns during the specified period.\n- Fidelity often offers multiple funds within the same category, so there could be several options to consider.\n- The performance of these funds can be influenced by various factors such as market conditions, management strategies, and geopolitical events, but without specific data, these are just educated guesses.\n- **New Guess**: Since we are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase, it is possible that the fund with the lowest performance might be one that has been more conservative in its investment approach, focusing on stability rather than high growth. This could be a fund that invests in a broader range of emerging markets rather than concentrating on high-growth but high-risk sectors.\n- **Additional Guess**: The fund with the lowest percentage increase might also be one that has a higher focus on risk management and diversification, which could have helped it weather market downturns better than more aggressive funds.\n- **Updated Guess**: Based on the search results and the structure of the Fidelity website, it appears that the search functionality might not be returning the most relevant results. It might be more effective to navigate directly to the 'Funds' section and use the filters provided there to find the relevant funds.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n\n1. **Navigate to Fidelity International Website:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to the Fidelity International website (https://www.fidelity.co.uk/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the location is set to 'United Kingdom'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Funds' section.\n\n2. **Search for Relevant Funds:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search function within the 'Funds' section to look for 'Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Apply the filter for $0 transaction fees.\n\n3. **Collect Fund List:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and identifiers (e.g., ISIN codes) of the relevant funds.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the list is comprehensive and accurate.\n\n4. **Collect Historical Data:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified fund, navigate to its historical performance page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the net asset value (NAV) or share price for May 2019 and May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the data is accurate and from a reliable source.\n\n5. **Calculate Percentage Increase:**\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each fund using the collected data.\n   - **Assistant**: Run the script to identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n6. **Verify and Report:**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the results and prepare a final report.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the calculated percentage increase.\n\n### Detailed Instructions for WebSurfer:\n\n1. **Navigate to Fidelity International Website:**\n   - Open the web browser and go to https://www.fidelity.co.uk/.\n   - Ensure the location is set to 'United Kingdom'.\n\n2. **Navigate to the 'Funds' Section:**\n   - Click on 'Funds' in the main navigation menu.\n   - Ensure you are in the 'Funds' section.\n\n3. **Search for Relevant Funds:**\n   - Use the search function within the 'Funds' section to look for 'Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds'.\n   - Apply the filter for $0 transaction fees.\n\n4. **Collect Fund List:**\n   - Extract the names and identifiers (e.g., ISIN codes) of the relevant funds.\n   - Ensure the list is comprehensive and accurate.\n\n5. **Collect Historical Data:**\n   - For each identified fund, navigate to its historical performance page.\n   - Record the net asset value (NAV) or share price for May 2019 and May 2024.\n   - Ensure the data is accurate and from a reliable source.\n\n### Python Script Example:\n```python\n# Sample Python script to calculate percentage increase\nfunds = {\n    'Fund A': {'May_2019': 100, 'May_2024': 120},\n    'Fund B': {'May_2019': 150, 'May_2024': 160},\n    'Fund C': {'May_2019': 200, 'May_2024': 210}\n}\n\ndef calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n    return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\nresults = {}\nfor fund, values in funds.items():\n    start_value = values['May_2019']\n    end_value = values['May_2024']\n    percentage_increase = calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value)\n    results[fund] = percentage_increase\n\n# Find the fund with the lowest percentage increase\nlowest_increase_fund = min(results, key=results.get)\nlowest_increase_value = results[lowest_increase_fund]\n\nprint(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with an increase of {lowest_increase_value:.2f}%.\")\n```\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes:\n- **Specific Search Terms**: Use specific search terms like \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds UK\" to narrow down the results.\n- **Direct Navigation**: Directly navigate to the 'Funds' section and use the filters provided on the website to find the relevant funds.\n- **Data Verification**: Double-check the accuracy of the historical data collected to ensure it is from the correct time periods and sources.\n- **Detailed Instructions**: Provide detailed instructions to the WebSurfer to ensure they navigate and extract data correctly.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to gather the necessary data. \n\n**Next Step:**\n- **WebSurfer**: Go to the Fidelity International website (https://www.fidelity.co.uk/).\n- **WebSurfer**: Ensure the location is set to 'United Kingdom'.\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Funds' section.\n- **WebSurfer**: Use the search function within the 'Funds' section to look for 'Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds'.\n- **WebSurfer**: Apply the filter for $0 transaction fees.\n- **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and identifiers (e.g., ISIN codes) of the relevant funds.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The WebSurfer did not successfully navigate to the 'Funds' section and apply the necessary filters to find the relevant mutual funds.\n2. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided were not detailed enough to guide the WebSurfer through the specific steps required to find the list of Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n3. **Inefficient Data Collection**: The process of collecting historical data (May 2019 to May 2024) was not clearly defined or executed, leading to incomplete or incorrect data.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Fidelity International Website:**\n   -
