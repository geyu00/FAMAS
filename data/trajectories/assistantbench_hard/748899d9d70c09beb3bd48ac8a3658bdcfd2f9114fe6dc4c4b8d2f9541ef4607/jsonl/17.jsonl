{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nHow much does it cost to send an envelope with 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with DHL, USPS, or Fedex? (Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sender is located in Rio de Janeiro.\n   - The recipient is located in New York City (NYC).\n   - The desired delivery time is 1 week.\n   - The item to be sent is an envelope.\n   - The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n   - Specific 1-week delivery options available from DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping option, including any additional fees or taxes.\n   - Whether the 1-week delivery requirement can be met by the standard services offered by DHL, USPS, and FedEx, or if expedited services are needed.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - DHL, USPS, and FedEx likely offer various international shipping options, and the 1-week delivery requirement might be met by their express or priority services.\n   - Additional fees or taxes might vary based on the weight and size of the envelope, but these are generally consistent across similar items.\n   - The cost for international shipping from Brazil to the USA is likely to be higher than domestic shipping due to longer distances and customs processes.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the required information**: Confirm the current shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC within 1 week.\n- **Assign WebSurfer to gather data**:\n  - Search for DHL's international shipping rates and options for 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n  - Search for USPS's international shipping rates and options for 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n  - Search for FedEx's international shipping rates and options for 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n- **Extract and compile the data**:\n  - WebSurfer will extract the relevant shipping rates and options from the websites.\n  - Ensure that the extracted data includes any additional fees or taxes.\n- **Format the data**:\n  - Assistant will format the extracted data into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\".\n- **Review and finalize the response**:\n  - Assistant will review the compiled data to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n  - Provide the final list of JSON objects as the answer to the original request."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nHow much does it cost to send an envelope with 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with DHL, USPS, or Fedex? (Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and the challenges we've encountered:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sender is located in Rio de Janeiro.\n   - The recipient is located in New York City (NYC).\n   - The desired delivery time is 1 week.\n   - The item to be sent is an envelope.\n   - The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - The USPS website allows for calculating international shipping rates, but specific forms need to be filled out for accurate pricing.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for DHL and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n   - Specific 1-week delivery options available from DHL and FedEx.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n   - Detailed USPS shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery requirement.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping option, including any additional fees or taxes.\n   - Whether the 1-week delivery requirement can be met by the standard services offered by DHL, USPS, and FedEx, or if expedited services are needed.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - DHL, USPS, and FedEx likely offer various international shipping options, and the 1-week delivery requirement might be met by their express or priority services. However, there may be limitations or issues with accessing the DHL and FedEx websites that need to be addressed.\n   - Additional fees or taxes might vary based on the weight and size of the envelope, but these are generally consistent across similar items. For example, customs duties and handling fees are common for international shipments.\n   - The cost for international shipping from Brazil to the USA is likely to be higher than domestic shipping due to longer distances and customs processes. Given the challenges with accessing DHL and FedEx websites, it is possible that these costs could be higher than initially estimated.\n   - The USPS website is functional and can provide accurate shipping rates, but the form must be completed correctly to get the exact rates for the 1-week delivery requirement.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The repeated issues with accessing the DHL and FedEx websites suggest that there might be technical or regional restrictions affecting our ability to retrieve the information directly. This could mean that the actual rates might need to be obtained through alternative means, such as customer service or third-party shipping calculators.\n- The USPS website is accessible and provides a structured way to calculate shipping rates, which increases the likelihood of obtaining accurate and reliable information for this carrier.\n- The additional fees and taxes are a significant factor in international shipping, and they can vary widely depending on the specific policies of each carrier and the regulations of both Brazil and the USA. Therefore, it is important to account for these costs when providing the final estimates.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Technical Issues with DHL and FedEx Websites**:\n   - Both the DHL and FedEx websites encountered HTTP errors (e.g., `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`), preventing us from accessing the necessary shipping rate information.\n   \n2. **Incomplete Form Filling on USPS Website**:\n   - The form on the USPS website was not fully filled out, leading to incomplete or incorrect data extraction.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Address Technical Issues with DHL and FedEx Websites**:\n   - **Use Alternative Methods**: If direct access continues to fail, use search engines to find third-party shipping calculators or customer service contacts for DHL and FedEx.\n   - **Check Network and Browser Settings**: Ensure that the network and browser settings are configured correctly to avoid protocol errors.\n\n2. **Complete Form Filling on USPS Website**:\n   - **Fill Out All Required Fields**: Ensure all necessary fields (destination country, ZIP codes, date and time, item type, and delivery options) are filled out accurately.\n   - **Capture and Extract Data**: After filling out the form, capture the resulting shipping rates and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n3. **Fallback to Customer Service**:\n   - **Contact Customer Service**: If the websites continue to fail, use the provided phone numbers to contact DHL and FedEx customer service for shipping rate information.\n\n4. **Compile and Format Data**:\n   - **Extract Relevant Information**: Once the shipping rates and additional fees are obtained, extract the relevant information.\n   - **Format as JSON**: Format the data into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\".\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Attempt to Access DHL and FedEx Websites Again**\n  - Navigate to the official DHL and FedEx websites.\n  - If access fails, search for third-party shipping calculators or customer service contacts.\n\n- **Step 2: Fill Out the Form on the USPS Website**\n  - Navigate to the USPS 'Calculate a Price' page.\n  - Fill out the form with the following details:\n    - Destination Country: United States\n    - ZIP Code Mailing From: 20000 (Rio de Janeiro)\n    - ZIP Code Mailing To: 10000 (New York City)\n    - Date and Time you plan to mail the item: Today's date and time\n    - Item: Envelope\n    - Select the option for 1-week delivery.\n  - Capture the resulting shipping rates and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n- **Step 3: Contact Customer Service if Necessary**\n  - If the websites continue to fail, use the following phone numbers to contact customer service:\n    - DHL: +1-800-225-5345\n    - FedEx: +1-800-463-3339\n  - Request shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery requirement.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile and Format Data**\n  - Extract the relevant shipping rates and additional fees from the sources.\n  - Format the data into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\".\n\n### Example JSON Format\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 25.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"DHL\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 30.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"FedEx\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 28.00\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis plan should help us overcome the previous challenges and successfully obtain the required shipping rates."}

(Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and the new challenges we've encountered:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sender is located in Rio de Janeiro.\n   - The recipient is located in New York City (NYC).\n   - The desired delivery time is 1 week.\n   - The item to be sent is an envelope.\n   - The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - The USPS website allows for calculating international shipping rates, but specific forms need to be filled out for accurate pricing.\n   - The FedEx website is currently experiencing issues, displaying a system down message and preventing access to the shipping rate calculator.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for DHL for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n   - Specific 1-week delivery options available from DHL.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n   - Detailed USPS shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery requirement.\n   - Alternative methods to obtain FedEx shipping rates, such as customer service or third-party calculators.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping option, including any additional fees or taxes.\n   - Whether the 1-week delivery requirement can be met by the standard services offered by DHL, USPS, and FedEx, or if expedited services are needed.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - DHL likely offers various international shipping options, and the 1-week delivery requirement might be met by their express or priority services. However, there may be limitations or issues with accessing the DHL website that need to be addressed.\n   - Additional fees or taxes might vary based on the weight and size of the envelope, but these are generally consistent across similar items. For example, customs duties and handling fees are common for international shipments.\n   - The cost for international shipping from Brazil to the USA is likely to be higher than domestic shipping due to longer distances and customs processes. Given the challenges with accessing DHL and FedEx websites, it is possible that these costs could be higher than initially estimated.\n   - The USPS website is functional and can provide accurate shipping rates, but the form must be completed correctly to get the exact rates for the 1-week delivery requirement.\n   - Given the current issues with the FedEx website, it is likely that we will need to use alternative methods, such as customer service or third-party calculators, to obtain the shipping rates.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The repeated issues with accessing the DHL and FedEx websites suggest that there might be technical or regional restrictions affecting our ability to retrieve the information directly. This could mean that the actual rates might need to be obtained through alternative means, such as customer service or third-party shipping calculators.\n- The USPS website is accessible and provides a structured way to calculate shipping rates, which increases the likelihood of obtaining accurate and reliable information for this carrier.\n- The additional fees and taxes are a significant factor in international shipping, and they can vary widely depending on the specific policies of each carrier and the regulations of both Brazil and the USA. Therefore, it is important to account for these costs when providing the final estimates.\n- Given the current system down message on the FedEx website, it is highly likely that we will need to use alternative methods to obtain the shipping rates, such as contacting customer service or using third-party calculators.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Access DHL Website and Calculate Rates**\n   - Navigate to the official DHL website.\n   - Use the shipping rate calculator to input the details for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery requirement.\n   - If access fails, search for third-party shipping calculators or customer service contacts for DHL.\n\n2. **Fill Out the Form on the USPS Website**\n   - Navigate to the USPS 'Calculate a Price' page.\n   - Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Destination Country: United States\n     - ZIP Code Mailing From: 20000 (Rio de Janeiro)\n     - ZIP Code Mailing To: 10000 (New York City)\n     - Date and Time you plan to mail the item: Today's date and time\n     - Item: Envelope\n     - Select the option for 1-week delivery.\n   - Capture the resulting shipping rates and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n3. **Contact FedEx Customer Service**\n   - Use the provided phone number to contact FedEx customer service for shipping rate information:\n     - FedEx: +1-800-463-3339\n   - Request shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery requirement.\n\n4. **Compile and Format Data**\n   - Extract the relevant shipping rates and additional fees from the sources.\n   - Format the data into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\".\n\n### Example JSON Format\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 25.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"DHL\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 30.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"FedEx\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 28.00\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis updated plan should help us overcome the previous challenges and successfully obtain the required shipping rates.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Technical Issues with DHL and FedEx Websites**:\n   - Both the DHL and FedEx websites encountered HTTP errors or displayed system down messages, preventing us from accessing the necessary shipping rate information.\n\n2. **Incomplete Form Filling on USPS Website**:\n   - The form on the USPS website was not fully filled out, leading to incomplete or incorrect data extraction.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Access DHL Website via Third-Party Calculator**:\n   - Use a search engine to find a reputable third-party shipping calculator for DHL.\n   - Input the details for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery requirement.\n   - Capture the resulting shipping rates and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n2. **Fill Out the Form on the USPS Website Correctly**:\n   - Navigate to the USPS 'Calculate a Price' page.\n   - Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Destination Country: United States\n     - ZIP Code Mailing From: 20000 (Rio de Janeiro)\n     -

Note down the rates and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n4. **Compile and Format Data**:\n   - Extract the relevant shipping rates and additional fees from the sources.\n   - Format the data into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\".\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Access DHL Website via Third-Party Calculator**\n  - Search for \"DHL shipping rate calculator\" on a search engine.\n  - Select a reputable third-party calculator.\n  - Input the following details:\n    - Origin: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n    - Destination: New York City, USA\n    - Item: Envelope\n    - Delivery Time: 1 week\n  - Capture the resulting shipping rates and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n- **Step 2: Fill Out the Form on the USPS Website**\n  - Navigate to the USPS 'Calculate a Price' page.\n  - Fill out the form with the following details:\n    - Destination Country: United States\n    - ZIP Code Mailing From: 20000 (Rio de Janeiro)\n    - ZIP Code Mailing To: 10000 (New York City)\n    - Date and Time you plan to mail the item: Today's date and time\n    - Item: Envelope\n    - Select the option for 1-week delivery.\n  - Capture the resulting shipping rates and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n- **Step 3: Contact FedEx Customer Service**\n  - Call the FedEx customer service number: +1-800-463-3339.\n  - Request shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery requirement.\n  - Note down the rates and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile and Format Data**\n  - Extract the relevant shipping rates and additional fees from the sources.\n  - Format the data into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\".\n\n### Example JSON Format\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 25.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"DHL\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 30.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"FedEx\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 28.00\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis plan should help us overcome the previous challenges and successfully obtain the required shipping rates."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nHow much does it cost to send an envelope with 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with DHL, USPS, or Fedex? (Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The sender is located in Rio de Janeiro.\n- The recipient is located in New York City (NYC).\n- The desired delivery time is 1 week.\n- The item to be sent is an envelope.\n- The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n- The USPS website allows for calculating international shipping rates, but specific forms need to be filled out for accurate pricing.\n- The FedEx website is currently experiencing issues, displaying a system down message and preventing access to the shipping rate calculator.\n- The DHL website is also experiencing issues, specifically a `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` when attempting to navigate to the site.\n- Shippo is a reputable third-party shipping calculator that supports multiple carriers, including DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Current shipping rates for DHL for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n- Specific 1-week delivery options available from DHL.\n- Any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n- Detailed USPS shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery requirement.\n- Alternative methods to obtain FedEx shipping rates, such as customer service or third-party calculators.\n- Alternative methods to obtain DHL shipping rates, such as customer service or third-party calculators.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The total cost for each shipping option, including any additional fees or taxes.\n- Whether the 1-week delivery requirement can be met by the standard services offered by DHL, USPS, and FedEx, or if expedited services are needed.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **DHL**: Given the technical issues with the DHL website, it is likely that we will need to use alternative methods, such as customer service or third-party shipping calculators, to obtain the shipping rates. DHL typically offers various international shipping options, and the 1-week delivery requirement might be met by their express or priority services.\n- **Additional Fees and Taxes**: Additional fees or taxes might vary based on the weight and size of the envelope, but these are generally consistent across similar items. Customs duties and handling fees are common for international shipments.\n- **USPS**: The USPS website is functional and can provide accurate shipping rates, but the form must be completed correctly to get the exact rates for the 1-week delivery requirement. USPS often has detailed and structured forms for international shipping, which should help in getting precise rates.\n- **FedEx**: Given the current issues with the FedEx website, it is highly likely that we will need to use alternative methods, such as customer service or third-party calculators, to obtain the shipping rates. FedEx is known for its reliable and detailed customer service, which should be able to provide the necessary information.\n- **Cost Estimation**: The cost for international shipping from Brazil to the USA is likely to be higher than domestic shipping due to longer distances and customs processes. Given the challenges with accessing DHL and FedEx websites, it is possible that these costs could be higher than initially estimated.\n- **Shippo as a Solution**: Since Shippo is a reputable third-party shipping calculator that supports multiple carriers, including DHL, USPS, and FedEx, it is a viable alternative to obtain accurate shipping rates. Using Shippo should help us bypass the technical issues with the DHL and FedEx websites.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The technical issues with the DHL and FedEx websites suggest that there might be regional or temporary restrictions affecting our ability to retrieve the information directly. Using alternative methods like customer service or third-party calculators is a practical approach to overcome these issues.\n- The USPS website is accessible and provides a structured way to calculate shipping rates, which increases the likelihood of obtaining accurate and reliable information for this carrier.\n- Additional fees and taxes are a significant factor in international shipping, and they can vary widely depending on the specific policies of each carrier and the regulations of both Brazil and the USA. Therefore, it is important to account for these costs when providing the final estimates.\n- Given the current system down message on the FedEx website, it is highly likely that we will need to use alternative methods to obtain the shipping rates, such as contacting customer service or using third-party calculators.\n- Shippo is a reputable and reliable third-party shipping calculator that can provide accurate shipping rates for multiple carriers, making it a valuable resource for overcoming the technical issues with the DHL and FedEx websites.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Shippo for DHL, USPS, and FedEx Rates**\n   - Navigate to the Shippo shipping calculator.\n   - Input the following details for each carrier:\n     - Origin: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n     - Destination: New York City, USA\n     - Item: Envelope\n     - Delivery Time: 1 week\n   - Capture the resulting shipping rates and any additional fees or taxes for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n\n2. **Fill Out the Form on the USPS Website**\n   - Navigate to the USPS 'Calculate a Price' page.\n   - Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Destination Country: United States\n     - ZIP Code Mailing From: 20000 (Rio de Janeiro)\n     - ZIP Code Mailing To: 10000 (New York City)\n     - Date and Time you plan to mail the item: Today's date and time\n     - Item: Envelope\n     - Select the option for 1-week delivery.\n   - Capture the resulting shipping rates and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n3. **Contact FedEx Customer Service**\n   - Use the provided phone number to contact FedEx customer service for shipping rate information:\n     - FedEx: +1-800-463-3339 (International)\n   - Request shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery requirement.\n   - Note down the rates and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n4. **Compile and Format Data**\n   - Extract the relevant shipping rates and additional fees from the sources.\n   - Format the data into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\".\n\n### Example JSON Format\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 25.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"DHL\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 30.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"FedEx\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 28.00\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis updated plan leverages the Shippo third-party calculator to bypass the technical issues with the DHL and FedEx websites and ensures that we obtain accurate and reliable shipping rates for all carriers.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Technical Issues with DHL and FedEx Websites**:\n   - Both the DHL and FedEx websites were experiencing technical issues, preventing direct access to their shipping rate calculators.\n   - The DHL website encountered a `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`, and the FedEx website displayed a system down message.\n\n2. **Ineffective Use of Third-Party Calculators**:\n   - The initial attempt to use a third-party calculator (Shippo) did not lead to a successful retrieval of shipping rates, possibly due to navigation or form-filling issues.\n\n3. **Incomplete Form Filling on USPS Website**:\n   - The form on the USPS website was not fully filled out, leading to incomplete or incorrect data extraction.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Shippo for DHL, USPS, and FedEx Rates**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Shippo website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Get Started\" or \"Sign Up\" to access the shipping calculator.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Input the following details for each carrier:\n     - **Origin**: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n     - **Destination**: New York City, USA\n     - **Item**: Envelope\n     - **Delivery Time**: 1 week\n   - **WebSurfer**: Capture the resulting shipping rates and any additional fees or taxes for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n\n2. **Fill Out the Form on the USPS Website**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the USPS 'Calculate a Price' page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - **Destination Country**: United States\n     - **ZIP Code Mailing From**: 20000 (Rio de Janeiro)\n     - **ZIP Code Mailing To**: 10000 (New York City)\n     - **Date and Time you plan to mail the item**: Today's date and time\n     - **Item**: Envelope\n     - **Select the option for 1-week delivery**.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Capture the resulting shipping rates and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n3. **Contact FedEx Customer Service**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the provided phone number to contact FedEx customer service for shipping rate information:\n     - **FedEx**: +1-800-463-3339 (International)\n   - **WebSurfer**: Request shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery requirement.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the rates and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n4. **Compile and Format Data**\n   - **Assistant**: Extract the relevant shipping rates and additional fees from the sources.\n   - **Assistant**: Format the data into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\".\n\n### Example JSON Format\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 25.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"DHL\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 30.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"FedEx\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 28.00\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Ensure Complete Form Filling**: Double-check that all required fields are filled out correctly on the USPS form to avoid incomplete data extraction.\n- **Use Shippo Effectively**: Ensure that you navigate to the correct section of the Shippo website and input all required details accurately.\n- **Contact Customer Service Directly**: If the FedEx website remains down, contacting customer service is a reliable backup method to obtain shipping rates.\n- **Capture All Relevant Information**: Make sure to note down any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping."}
