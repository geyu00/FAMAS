{"agent": "GraphicDesign_Expert", "content": "As the GraphicDesign_Expert, I can suggest an alternative approach. If we want to proceed without the link, I can help by explaining how to analyze the meaning of symbols in general, especially those with curved lines. However, we still need to identify the specific symbol from Eva Draconis's banner first. \n\nOnce someone finds the link or shares the symbol, we can then focus on the design elements, such as color, shape, and potential cultural significance, which can help us deduce its meaning. Please keep an eye out for any updates regarding her website."}

If anyone in the group can find the website link or has any insights on the symbol displayed in the banner, please share it so we can proceed with a thorough examination."}
