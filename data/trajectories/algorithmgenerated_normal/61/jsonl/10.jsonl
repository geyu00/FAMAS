Since I do not have access to the script, I recommend that someone provides the Python code found in the image.

{"agent": "C++_Expert", "content": "It appears there is a misunderstanding, as I do not have the ability to extract the Python script from the image. I recommend that we need to locate the script manually. If anyone can access the image file or has the script content, please share it.
