I live in Pearl City, Hawaii, which is on the island of Oahu. I know two homes near me that sold in 2022 were 2072 Akaikai Loop, and 2017 Komo Mai Drive. Find which of those homes sold for more in 2022, and tell me how much it sold for. Don’t put commas or decimal places in the answer. Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nFind out which of the two homes, 2072 Akaikai Loop or 2017 Komo Mai Drive in Pearl City, Hawaii, sold for more in 2022, and provide the sale price without commas or decimal places.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The real estate analyst will gather recent sales data for the two specified homes in Pearl City, Hawaii.\n2. The data analyst will extract and verify the sales data for accuracy.\n3. The checker will ensure the accuracy of the information and confirm which home sold for more and the exact sale price.\n\n## Output format\n- The address of the home that sold for more.\n- The sale price of the home that sold for more without commas or decimal places.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The information must be accurate and verified.\n- The sale price should be provided without commas or decimal places."}
