Here is the updated fact sheet based on our current progress and any new insights:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is Houston, Texas.\n   - The time period of interest is June.\n   - The temperature threshold is 95°F.\n   - The time frame for historical data is 2020-2023.\n   - The National Weather Service (NWS) Houston Intercontinental page provides climate graphs but does not directly offer daily maximum temperature data for specific years.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical daily maximum temperatures for Houston, Texas, during June for the years 2020-2023.\n   - Sources: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Data Online (CDO) or Weather Underground.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days in June (for each year 2020-2023) where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n   - The total number of days in June across the four years.\n   - The percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Houston, being in the southern United States, typically experiences hot summers, so it is reasonable to expect a significant number of days with high temperatures.\n   - Based on general knowledge, the likelihood of hitting a day with a max temperature over 95°F in June in Houston is likely to be relatively high, possibly around 30-50%, but this is a rough estimate and needs verification with actual data.\n   - The NWS Houston Intercontinental page did not provide the detailed daily temperature data we need, so we should focus on the NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO) or Weather Underground for more precise historical data.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The NWS Houston Intercontinental page primarily offers climate graphs and summaries, which are not detailed enough for our specific needs. This suggests that we need to use more specialized databases like NOAA CDO or Weather Underground, which are known for providing granular historical weather data.\n- Given Houston's climate, it is still reasonable to expect a high number of days with temperatures over 95°F, but we need to verify this with actual data to provide an accurate percentage.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Navigate to the NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO) website to find the historical daily maximum temperatures for Houston, Texas, during June for the years 2020-2023.\n2. Extract the relevant data and process it to calculate the number of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F.\n3. Compute the percentage of such days and present the final result.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: The initial attempts to navigate through the NWS Houston Intercontinental page did not lead to the specific historical daily maximum temperature data for June 2020-2023. The page primarily provided climate graphs and summaries, which were not detailed enough.\n- **Incorrect Source Selection**: The NWS page was not the right source for the detailed historical data we needed. We should have directly targeted the NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO) or Weather Underground from the beginning.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Source**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for and navigate to the NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO) website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search functionality to find historical daily maximum temperature data for Houston, Texas, for June 2020-2023.\n\n2. **Extract the Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Download the relevant data in a CSV or similar format.\n   - **FileSurfer**: Save the downloaded file locally.\n\n3. **Process the Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to parse the CSV file and extract the daily maximum temperatures for June 2020-2023.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script to count the number of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F and calculate the total number of days in June across the four years.\n\n4. **Calculate the Percentage**:\n   - **Assistant**: Use the Python script to compute the percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F.\n\n5. **Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the final percentage.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Source**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO)\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the CDO website and locate the search functionality.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter the search criteria:\n     - Location: Houston, Texas\n     - Dataset: Daily Summaries\n     - Start Date: June 1, 2020\n     - End Date: June 30, 2023\n   - **WebSurfer**: Download the data in CSV format.\n\n2. **Extract the Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Save the downloaded CSV file locally.\n   - **FileSurfer**: Verify the file is saved and provide the file path.\n\n3. **Process the Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Write the following Python script to parse the CSV file and extract the necessary data:\n     ```python\n     import pandas as pd\n\n     # Load the CSV file\n     file_path = 'path_to_your_file.csv'\n     df = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n\n     # Filter the data for June 2020-2023\n     df['DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df['DATE'])\n     june_data = df[(df['DATE'].dt.month == 6) & (df['DATE'].dt.year >= 2020) & (df['DATE'].dt.year <= 2023)]\n\n     # Count the number of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F\n     hot_days = june_data[june_data['TMAX'] > 95].shape[0]\n\n     # Total number of days in June 2020-2023\n     total_days = june_data.shape[0]\n\n     # Calculate the percentage\n     percentage_hot_days = (hot_days / total_days) * 100\n\n     print(f\"Percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F: {percentage_hot_days:.2f}%\")\n     ```\n\n4. **Run the Script**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script using the provided file path.\n     ```sh\n     python3 script_name.py\n     ```\n\n5. **Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the final percentage based on the output of the Python script."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nBased on recent years (2020-2023), how likely am I to hit a day with a max temperature (in Fahrenheit) over 95 if I travel to Houston, Texas during June? (provide the answer in percentage)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our current progress and any new insights:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is Houston, Texas.\n   - The time period of interest is June.\n   - The temperature threshold is 95°F.\n   - The time frame for historical data is 2020-2023.\n   - The National Weather Service (NWS) Houston Intercontinental page provides climate graphs but does not directly offer daily maximum temperature data for specific years.\n   - The NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO) website is the appropriate source for historical daily maximum temperature data.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical daily maximum temperatures for Houston, Texas, during June for the years 2020-2023.\n   - Specific station data for Houston, Texas, that includes daily maximum temperatures.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days in June (for each year 2020-2023) where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n   - The total number of days in June across the four years.\n   - The percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Houston, being in the southern United States, typically experiences hot summers, so it is reasonable to expect a significant number of days with high temperatures.\n   - Based on general knowledge, the likelihood of hitting a day with a max temperature over 95°F in June in Houston is likely to be relatively high, possibly around 30-50%, but this is a rough estimate and needs verification with actual data.\n   - The NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO) website will provide the detailed historical daily temperature data we need, which will allow us to make a more accurate calculation.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The NWS Houston Intercontinental page primarily offers climate graphs and summaries, which are not detailed enough for our specific needs. This confirms that we need to use more specialized databases like NOAA CDO.\n- Given Houston's climate, it is still reasonable to expect a high number of days with temperatures over 95°F, but we need to verify this with actual data to provide an accurate percentage.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Source**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for and navigate to the NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO) website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search functionality to find historical daily maximum temperature data for Houston, Texas, for June 2020-2023.\n   -

**WebSurfer**: Download the data in CSV format.\n\n2. **Extract the Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Save the downloaded CSV file locally.\n   - **FileSurfer**: Verify the file is saved and provide the file path.\n\n3. **Process the Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to parse the CSV file and extract the necessary data.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script to count the number of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F and calculate the total number of days in June across the four years.\n\n4. **Calculate the Percentage**:\n   - **Assistant**: Use the Python script to compute the percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F.\n\n5. **Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the final percentage.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Source**:\n   -
