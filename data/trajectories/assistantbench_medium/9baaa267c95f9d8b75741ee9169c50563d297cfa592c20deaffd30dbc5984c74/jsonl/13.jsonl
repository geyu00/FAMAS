It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and an updated educated guess:\n\n---\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Houston, Texas.\n   - The time frame of interest is June.\n   - The temperature threshold of interest is 95°F.\n   - The period of recent years to consider is 2020-2023.\n   - The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) database on the NOAA website is a reliable source for historical weather data.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical weather data for Houston, Texas, specifically the maximum temperatures for each day in June for the years 2020-2023.\n   - These data can be found on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website, specifically the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) database.\n   - Additional sources could include local weather stations or climate databases like Weather Underground.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days in June for each year from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n   - The total number of days in June over the four-year period.\n   - The percentage of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, Houston, Texas, is known for its hot summers, and it is reasonable to expect that a significant portion of June days may exceed 95°F.\n   - Given the challenges in accessing the specific data through the NCEI search tool, it is possible that the data might be more readily available through Weather Underground or another similar service.\n   - A refined rough estimate, considering the typical climate of Houston, might place this percentage in the range of 30-50%, but this is still speculative and needs verification with actual data.\n\n---\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guess:**\n- The initial guess of 20-40% was based on general knowledge of Houston's climate. However, given that Houston is known for its extremely hot summers, and considering the specific month of June, which often sees very high temperatures, it is reasonable to adjust the estimate to a slightly higher range of 30-50%. This adjustment reflects a more conservative approach while still acknowledging the likelihood of frequent high temperatures in June.\n\nNext steps:\n- Continue efforts to extract the required data from the NCEI database or explore alternative sources like Weather Underground.\n- Once the data is obtained, process it to derive the exact percentage of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incomplete Form Filling**: The form on the NCEI search page was not fully filled out. Specifically, the \"Select Weather Observation Type/Dataset\" and \"Select Date Range\" fields were not completed.\n- **Lack of Verification**: There was no verification step to ensure that all required fields were correctly filled before submitting the search.\n- **Repetition of Steps**: The same steps were repeated multiple times without addressing the underlying issue, leading to no progress.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the NCEI Search Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the NCEI search page: [Search | Climate Data Online (CDO) | National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search).\n\n2. **Fill Out the Search Form Correctly**:\n   - **Select Weather Observation Type/Dataset**: Choose 'Daily Summaries'.\n   - **Select Date Range**: Set the start date to 06/01/2020 and the end date to 06/30/2023.\n   - **Search For**: Enter 'Houston, TX' in the location field.\n   - **Verify All Fields**: Ensure all required fields are filled out before submitting the search.\n\n3. **Submit the Search**:\n   - Click the search button to submit the form.\n\n4. **Extract the Data**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate through the results and extract the daily maximum temperatures for June in the years 2020-2023.\n   - Save the extracted data to a file.\n\n5. **Process the Data**:\n   - Use Assistant to write a Python script to read the saved data, count the number of days in June for each year from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F, and calculate the total number of days in June over the four-year period.\n   - Compute the percentage of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - Use Assistant to summarize the findings and provide the final percentage.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Double-Check Form Fields**: Before submitting the search, double-check that all required fields are correctly filled out.\n- **Use Verification Steps**: Add a step to verify that the form is filled out correctly before submission.\n- **Save Intermediate Steps**: Save the extracted data to a file to avoid losing progress if there are any issues.\n- **Be Patient with Page Loads**: Allow sufficient time for pages to load completely, especially if the data is large or the server is slow.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nBased on recent years (2020-2023), how likely am I to hit a day with a max temperature (in Fahrenheit) over 95 if I travel to Houston, Texas during June? (provide the answer in percentage)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and an updated educated guess:\n\n---\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Houston, Texas.\n   - The time frame of interest is June.\n   - The temperature threshold of interest is 95°F.\n   - The period of recent years to consider is 2020-2023.\n   - The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) database on the NOAA website is a reliable source for historical weather data.\n   - The NCEI search form requires all fields to be correctly filled out, including the dataset, date range, and location.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical weather data for Houston, Texas, specifically the maximum temperatures for each day in June for the years 2020-2023.\n   - These data can be found on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website, specifically the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) database.\n   - Additional sources could include local weather stations or climate databases like Weather Underground.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days in June for each year from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n   - The total number of days in June over the four-year period.\n   - The percentage of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, Houston, Texas, is known for its hot summers, and it is reasonable to expect that a significant portion of June days may exceed 95°F.\n   - Given the challenges in accessing the specific data through the NCEI search tool, it is possible that the data might be more readily available through Weather Underground or another similar service.\n   - A refined rough estimate, considering the typical climate of Houston, might place this percentage in the range of 35-55%. This adjustment reflects a more conservative approach while still acknowledging the likelihood of frequent high temperatures in June.\n\n---\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guess:**\n- The initial guess of 20-40% was based on general knowledge of Houston's climate. However, given that Houston is known for its extremely hot summers, and considering the specific month of June, which often sees very high temperatures, it is reasonable to adjust the estimate to a slightly higher range of 35-55%. This adjustment reflects a more conservative approach while still acknowledging the likelihood of frequent high temperatures in June.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the NCEI Search Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the NCEI search page: [Search | Climate Data Online (CDO) | National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search).\n\n2. **Fill Out the Search Form Correctly**:\n   - **Select Weather Observation Type/Dataset**: Choose 'Daily Summaries'.\n   - **Select Date Range**: Set the start date to 06/01/2020 and the end date to 06/30/2023.\n   - **Search For**: Enter 'Houston, TX' in the location field.\n   - **Verify All Fields**: Ensure all required fields are filled out before submitting the search.\n\n3. **Submit the Search**:\n   - Click the search button to submit the form.\n\n4. **Extract the Data**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate through the results and extract the daily maximum temperatures for June in the years 2020-2023.\n   - Save the extracted data to a file.\n\n5. **Process the Data**:\n   - Use Assistant to write a Python script to read the saved data, count the number of days in June for each year from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F, and calculate the total number of days in June over the four-year period.\n   - Compute the percentage of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - Use Assistant to summarize the findings and provide the final percentage.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n- **Double-Check Form Fields**: Before submitting the search, double-check that all required fields are correctly filled out.\n- **Use Verification Steps**: Add a step to verify that the form is filled out correctly before submission.\n- **Save Intermediate Steps**: Save the extracted data to a file to avoid losing progress if there are any issues.\n- **Be Patient with Page Loads**: Allow sufficient time for pages to load completely, especially if the data is large or the server is slow.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. Please navigate to the NCEI search page and fill out the form as specified.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incomplete Form Filling**: The form on the NCEI search page was not fully filled out. Specifically, the \"Select Date Range\" and \"Search For\" fields were not completed.\n- **Lack of Verification**: There was no verification step to ensure that all required fields were correctly filled before submitting the search.\n- **Repetition of Steps**: The same steps were repeated multiple times without addressing the underlying issue, leading to no progress.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the NCEI Search Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the NCEI search page: [Search | Climate Data Online (CDO) | National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search).\n\n2. **Fill Out the Search Form Correctly**:\n   - **Select Weather Observation Type/Dataset**: Choose 'Daily Summaries'.\n   - **Select Date Range**: Set the start date to 06/01/2020 and the end date to 06/30/2023.\n   - **Search For**: Enter 'Houston, TX' in the location field.\n   - **Verify All Fields**: Ensure all required fields are filled out before submitting the search. Double-check the following:\n     - Dataset: Daily Summaries\n     - Start Date: 06/01/2020\n     - End Date: 06/30/2023\n     - Location: Houston, TX\n\n3. **Submit the Search**:\n   - Click the search button to submit the form.\n\n4. **Extract the Data**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate through the results and extract the daily maximum temperatures for June in the years 2020-2023.\n   - Save the extracted data to a file.\n\n5. **Process the Data**:\n   - Use Assistant to write a Python script to read the saved data, count the number of days in June for each year from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F, and calculate the total number of days in June over the four-year period.\n   - Compute the percentage of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - Use Assistant to summarize the findings and provide the final percentage.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Double-Check Form Fields**: Before submitting the search, double-check that all required fields are correctly filled out.\n- **Use Verification Steps**: Add a step to verify that the form is filled out correctly before submission.\n- **Save Intermediate Steps**: Save the extracted data to a file to avoid losing progress if there are any issues.\n- **Be Patient with Page Loads**: Allow sufficient time for pages to load completely, especially if the data is large or the server is slow.\n- **Use Clear Instructions**: Provide clear and detailed instructions for each step to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nBased on recent years (2020-2023), how likely am I to hit a day with a max temperature (in Fahrenheit) over 95 if I travel to Houston, Texas during June? (provide the answer in percentage)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n---\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Houston, Texas.\n   - The time frame of interest is June.\n   - The temperature threshold of interest is 95°F.\n   - The period of recent years to consider is 2020-2023.\n   - The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) database on the NOAA website is a reliable source for historical weather data.\n   - The NCEI search form requires all fields to be correctly filled out, including the dataset, date range, and location.\n   - The NCEI search form has been successfully navigated to, and the dataset 'Daily Summaries' has been selected.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical weather data for Houston, Texas, specifically the maximum temperatures for each day in June for the years 2020-2023.\n   - These data can be found on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website, specifically the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) database.\n   - Additional sources could include local weather stations or climate databases like Weather Underground.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days in June for each year from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n   - The total number of days in June over the four-year period.\n   - The percentage of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, Houston, Texas, is known for its hot summers, and it is reasonable to expect that a significant portion of June days may exceed 95°F.\n   - Given the challenges in accessing the specific data through the NCEI search tool, it is possible that the data might be more readily available through Weather Underground or another similar service.\n   - A refined rough estimate, considering the typical climate of Houston, might place this percentage in the range of 40-60%. This adjustment reflects a more conservative approach while still acknowledging the likelihood of frequent high temperatures in June.\n\n---\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guess:**\n- The initial guess of 35-55% was based on general knowledge of Houston's climate. However, given that Houston is known for its extremely hot summers, and considering the specific month of June, which often sees very high temperatures, it is reasonable to adjust the estimate to a slightly higher range of 40-60%. This adjustment reflects a more conservative approach while still acknowledging the likelihood of frequent high temperatures in June.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the NCEI Search Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the NCEI search page: [Search | Climate Data Online (CDO) | National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search).\n\n2. **Fill Out the Search Form Correctly**:\n   - **Select Weather Observation Type/Dataset**: Choose 'Daily Summaries'.\n   - **Select Date Range**: Set the start date to 06/01/2020 and the end date to 06/30/2023.\n   - **Search For**: Enter 'Houston, TX' in the location field.\n   - **Verify All Fields**: Ensure all required fields are filled out before submitting the search.\n\n3. **Submit the Search**:\n   - Click the search button to submit the form.\n\n4. **Extract the Data**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate through the results and extract the daily maximum temperatures for June in the years 2020-2023.\n   - Save the extracted data to a file.\n\n5. **Process the Data**:\n   - Use Assistant to write a Python script to read the saved data, count the number of days in June for each year from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F, and calculate the total number of days in June over the four-year period.\n   - Compute the percentage of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - Use Assistant to summarize the findings and provide the final percentage.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n- **Double-Check Form Fields**: Before submitting the search, double-check that all required fields are correctly filled out.\n- **Use Verification Steps**: Add a step to verify that the form is filled out correctly before submission.\n- **Save Intermediate Steps**: Save the extracted data to a file to avoid losing progress if there are any issues.\n- **Be Patient with Page Loads**: Allow sufficient time for pages to load completely, especially if the data is large or the server is slow.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. Please navigate to the NCEI search page and fill out the form as specified. If you encounter any issues, let me know, and we will troubleshoot together.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incomplete Form Filling**: The form on the NCEI search page was not fully filled out. Specifically, the \"Select Date Range\" and \"Search For\" fields were not completed.\n- **Lack of Verification**: There was no verification step to ensure that all required fields were correctly filled before submitting the search.\n- **Repetition of Steps**: The same steps were repeated multiple times without addressing the underlying issue, leading to no progress.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the NCEI Search Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the NCEI search page: [Search | Climate Data Online (CDO) | National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search).\n\n2. **Fill Out the Search Form Correctly**:\n   - **Select Weather Observation Type/Dataset**: Choose 'Daily Summaries'.\n   - **Select Date Range**: Set the start date to 06/01/2020 and the end date to 06/30/2023.\n   - **Search For**: Enter 'Houston, TX' in the location field.\n   - **Verify All Fields**: Ensure all required fields are filled out before submitting the search. Double-check the following:\n     - Dataset: Daily Summaries\n     - Start Date: 06/01/2020\n     - End Date: 06/30/2023\n     - Location: Houston, TX\n\n3. **Submit the Search**:\n   - Click the search button to submit the form.\n\n4. **Extract the Data**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate through the results and extract the daily maximum temperatures for June in the years 2020-2023.\n   - Save the extracted data to a file.\n\n5. **Process the Data**:\n   - Use Assistant to write a Python script to read the saved data, count the number of days in June for each year from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F, and calculate the total number of days in June over the four-year period.\n   - Compute the percentage of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - Use Assistant to summarize the findings and provide the final percentage.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Double-Check Form Fields**: Before submitting the search, double-check that all required fields are correctly filled out.\n- **Use Verification Steps**: Add a step to verify that the form is filled out correctly before submission.\n- **Save Intermediate Steps**: Save the extracted data to a file to avoid losing progress if there are any issues.\n- **Be Patient with Page Loads**: Allow sufficient time for pages to load completely, especially if the data is large or the server is slow.\n- **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear and detailed instructions for each step to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n- **Error Handling**: If any step fails, note the error and try to resolve it before proceeding. If necessary, ask for assistance from the team.\n\n### Action Items\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the NCEI search page and fill out the form with the specified details. Verify all fields are correctly filled out before submitting the search.\n- **WebSurfer**: Extract the daily maximum temperatures for June in the years 2020-2023 and save the data to a file.\n- **Assistant**: Write a Python script to process the saved data and compute the required percentage.\n- **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the final percentage.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nBased on recent years (2020-2023), how likely am I to hit a day with a max temperature (in Fahrenheit) over 95 if I travel to Houston, Texas during June? (provide the answer in percentage)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n---\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Houston, Texas.\n   - The time frame of interest is June.\n   - The temperature threshold of interest is 95°F.\n   - The period of recent years to consider is 2020-2023.\n   - The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) database on the NOAA website is a reliable source for historical weather data.\n   - The NCEI search form requires all fields to be correctly filled out, including the dataset, date range, and location.\n   - The NCEI search form has been successfully navigated to, and the dataset 'Daily Summaries' has been selected.\n   - The station 'HOUSTON 7.7 W, TX US' (GHCND:US1TXHRR276) has been identified as a suitable station for extracting the data.\n   - The date range selection for June 2020-2023 has been attempted, but the form does not allow a multi-year selection directly.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical weather data for Houston, Texas, specifically the maximum temperatures for each day in June for the years 2020-2023.\n   - These data can be found on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website, specifically the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) database.\n   - Additional sources could include local weather stations or climate databases like Weather Underground.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days in June for each year from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n   - The total number of days in June over the four-year period.\n   - The percentage of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, Houston, Texas, is known for its hot summers, and it is reasonable to expect that a significant portion of June days may exceed 95°F.\n   - Given the challenges in accessing the specific data through the NCEI search tool, it is possible that the data might be more readily available through Weather Underground or another similar service.\n   - A refined rough estimate, considering the typical climate of Houston, might place this percentage in the range of 40-60%. This adjustment reflects a more conservative approach while still acknowledging the likelihood of frequent high temperatures in June.\n   - **New Educated Guess**: Since the NCEI form does not allow a direct multi-year selection, we may need to extract data for each year individually and then combine the results. This will ensure that we get accurate and complete data for the entire period.\n\n---\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guess:**\n- The initial guess of 35-55% was based on general knowledge of Houston's climate. However, given that Houston is known for its extremely hot summers, and considering the specific month of June, which often sees very high temperatures, it is reasonable to adjust the estimate to a slightly higher range of 40-60%. This adjustment reflects a more conservative approach while still acknowledging the likelihood of frequent high temperatures in June.\n- The new educated guess about extracting data for each year individually is based on the observation that the NCEI form does not allow a direct multi-year selection. This approach ensures that we can gather and process the data accurately.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the NCEI Search Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the NCEI search page: [Search | Climate Data Online (CDO) | National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search).\n\n2. **Fill Out the Search Form Correctly for Each Year**:\n   - **Select Weather Observation Type/Dataset**: Choose 'Daily Summaries'.\n   - **Select Date Range**: Set the start date to 06/01/2020 and the end date to 06/30/2020 for the first year.\n   - **Search For**: Enter 'Houston, TX' in the location field.\n   - **Verify All Fields**: Ensure all required fields are filled out before submitting the search.\n   - Repeat the above steps for each subsequent year (2021, 2022, 2023).\n\n3. **Submit the Search**:\n   - Click the search button to submit the form for each year.\n\n4. **Extract the Data**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate through the results and extract the daily maximum temperatures for June in each year from 2020 to 2023.\n   - Save the extracted data for each year to separate files.\n\n5. **Combine and Process the Data**:\n   - Use Assistant to write a Python script to read the saved data from each year, combine the data, count the number of days in June for each year from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F, and calculate the total number of days in June over the four-year period.\n   - Compute the percentage of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - Use Assistant to summarize the findings and provide the final percentage.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n- **Double-Check Form Fields**: Before submitting the search, double-check that all required fields are correctly filled out.\n- **Use Verification Steps**: Add a step to verify that the form is filled out correctly before submission.\n- **Save Intermediate Steps**: Save the extracted data for each year to separate files to avoid losing progress if there are any issues.\n- **Be Patient with Page Loads**: Allow sufficient time for pages to load completely, especially if the data is large or the server is slow.\n- **Extract Data Year by Year**: Since the form does not allow a direct multi-year selection, extract data for each year individually and then combine the results.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. Please navigate to the NCEI search page and fill out the form for the year 2020 as specified. If you encounter any issues, let me know, and we will troubleshoot together.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Date Range Selection**: The NCEI form does not allow a direct multi-year selection for the date range. We attempted to input a multi-year range, which did not work.\n- **Lack of Step-by-Step Extraction**: We did not break down the data extraction process into individual yearly extractions, which led to incomplete data collection.\n- **Insufficient Verification**: There was no verification step to ensure that the form was filled out correctly and that the data was being extracted as expected.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the NCEI Search Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the NCEI search page: [Search | Climate Data Online (CDO) | National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search).\n\n2. **Fill Out the Search Form for Each Year Individually**:\n   - **Select Weather Observation Type/Dataset**: Choose 'Daily Summaries'.\n   - **Select Date Range**: Set the start date to 06/01/YYYY and the end date to 06/30/YYYY for each year (YYYY = 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023).\n   - **Search For**: Enter 'Houston, TX' in the location field.\n   - **Verify All Fields**: Ensure all required fields are filled out before submitting the search.\n\n3. **Submit the Search**:\n   - Click the search button to submit the form for each year.\n\n4. **Extract the Data for Each Year**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate through the results and extract the daily maximum temperatures for June in each year from 2020 to 2023.\n   - Save the extracted data for each year to separate files (e.g., `houston_2020.csv`, `houston_2021.csv`, `houston_2022.csv`, `houston_2023.csv`).\n\n5. **Combine and Process the Data**:\n   - Use Assistant to write a Python script to read the saved data from each year, combine the data, count the number of days in June for each year from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F, and calculate the total number of days in June over the four-year period.\n   - Compute the percentage of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - Use Assistant to summarize the findings and provide the final percentage.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Double-Check Form Fields**: Before submitting the search, double-check that all required fields are correctly filled out.\n- **Use Verification Steps**: Add a step to verify that the form is filled out correctly before submission.\n- **Save Intermediate Steps**: Save the extracted data for each year to separate files to avoid losing progress if there are any issues.\n- **Be Patient with Page Loads**: Allow sufficient time for pages to load completely, especially if the data is large or the server is slow.\n- **Extract Data Year by Year**: Since the form does not allow a direct multi-year selection, extract data for each year individually and then combine the results.\n\n### Action Items\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the NCEI search page and fill out the form for the year 2020 as specified.
