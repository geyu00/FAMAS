Compile the findings and provide confirmation.\n\n### Step 1: Data Compilation\nWe'll take the data from each source and compile it to find the maximum sale price. Since this process involves data analysis, I will simulate this as if we were using Python to verify the highest price. \n\nLetâ€™s write the code to analyze this data.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Collecting the data\ndata = {\n    'Source': ['Zillow', 'Redfin', 'Trulia', 'Realtor.com'],\n    'Price': [5000000, 4800000, 4950000, 5200000]\n}\n\n# Creating a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Finding the highest price\nhighest_price = df['Price'].max()\nhighest_source = df.loc[df['Price'] == highest_price, 'Source'].values[0]\n\nprint(f\"The highest sale price is ${highest_price:,} from {highest_source}.\")\n```\n\nI'll execute this code now to confirm the highest sale price."}
