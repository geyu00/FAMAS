Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the closest eatery to Harkness Memorial State Park that is still open at 11pm on Wednesdays?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Harkness Memorial State Park.\n   - The time of interest is 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n   - The exact location (address) of Harkness Memorial State Park is 275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of nearby eateries around Harkness Memorial State Park.\n   - Operating hours for these eateries, specifically their closing times on Wednesdays.\n   - These facts can be found on:\n     - Local business directories (e.g., Google Maps, Yelp).\n     - The websites or social media pages of individual restaurants.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The distance between Harkness Memorial State Park and each nearby eatery.\n   - Determining which of these eateries is the closest and still open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, it is likely that many restaurants in the area close earlier than 11 PM, but some late-night options might exist, such as diners or fast-food places.\n   - The closest eatery might be within a few miles of the park, given typical urban and suburban restaurant distributions.\n   - From the initial search, the following restaurants are near Harkness Memorial State Park:\n     - Fred's Shanty Restaurant: 272 Pequot Ave, New London, CT 06320 (Closes at 8 PM)\n     - Mambo Bar & Restaurant: (Closes at 7 PM)\n     - Captain Scott's Lobster Dock: (Closes at 8 PM)\n     - Lucky Inn Chinese Restaurant: (Closes at 10:30 PM)\n     - Tony D's: (Closes at 10 PM)\n     - Ocean Pizza Restaurant and Bar: (Closes at 8:45 PM)\n   - Given the closing times, Lucky Inn Chinese Restaurant and Tony D's are the only options that are open past 10 PM on Wednesdays.\n   - Lucky Inn Chinese Restaurant, closing at 10:30 PM, is the closest to 11 PM and should be the primary candidate for being the closest eatery open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Find the exact distances** from Harkness Memorial State Park to Lucky Inn Chinese Restaurant and Tony D's.\n2. **Confirm the operating hours** for these two restaurants on Wednesdays to ensure they are indeed open until 10:30 PM and 10 PM, respectively.\n3. **Determine which of these two restaurants** is the closest to Harkness Memorial State Park.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Use of WebSurfer**: We repeatedly asked WebSurfer to navigate through multiple steps without clearly defining the end goal or providing specific instructions for each step. This led to a lack of direction and repeated actions.\n2. **Lack of Clear Intermediate Goals**: We did not break down the task into smaller, manageable steps with clear objectives, leading to confusion and redundancy.\n3. **Insufficient Data Collection**: We did not systematically collect and verify all necessary data (distances and operating hours) for the restaurants before making a final decision.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Collect and Verify All Necessary Data**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to find the exact distances from Harkness Memorial State Park to each of the following restaurants: Fred's Shanty Restaurant, Mambo Bar & Restaurant, Captain Scott's Lobster Dock, Lucky Inn Chinese Restaurant, Tony D's, and Ocean Pizza Restaurant and Bar.\n   - **Step 2**: Confirm the operating hours for each restaurant, specifically their closing times on Wednesdays.\n\n2. **Organize Data**:\n   - **Step 3**: Compile a list of the restaurants with their distances from Harkness Memorial State Park and their closing times on Wednesdays.\n\n3. **Determine the Closest Eatery Open at 11 PM on Wednesdays**:\n   - **Step 4**: Identify which restaurants are open past 10 PM on Wednesdays.\n   - **Step 5**: Among those, determine which one is the closest to Harkness Memorial State Park.\n\n4. **Summarize and Present the Findings**:\n   - **Step 6**: Provide the name, address, and distance of the closest eatery open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n### Detailed Instructions for WebSurfer\n\n1. **Find Distances and Operating Hours**:\n   - **Fred's Shanty Restaurant**:\n     - Address: 272 Pequot Ave, New London, CT 06320\n     - Use Google Maps to find the distance from 275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385 to 272 Pequot Ave, New London, CT 06320.\n     - Confirm the closing time on Wednesdays.\n   - **Mambo Bar & Restaurant**:\n     - Address: (Need to find the address)\n     - Use Google Maps to find the distance from 275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385 to the address of Mambo Bar & Restaurant.\n     - Confirm the closing time on Wednesdays.\n   - **Captain Scott's Lobster Dock**:\n     - Address: (Need to find the address)\n     - Use Google Maps to find the distance from 275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385 to the address of Captain Scott's Lobster Dock.\n     - Confirm the closing time on Wednesdays.\n   - **Lucky Inn Chinese Restaurant**:\n     - Address: (Need to find the address)\n     - Use Google Maps to find the distance from 275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385 to the address of Lucky Inn Chinese Restaurant.\n     - Confirm the closing time on Wednesdays.\n   - **Tony D's**:\n     - Address: (Need to find the address)\n     - Use Google Maps to find the distance from 275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385 to the address of Tony D's.\n     - Confirm the closing time on Wednesdays.\n   - **Ocean Pizza Restaurant and Bar**:\n     - Address: (Need to find the address)\n     - Use Google Maps to find the distance from 275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385 to the address of Ocean Pizza Restaurant and Bar.\n     - Confirm the closing time on Wednesdays.\n\n2. **Compile and Analyze Data**:\n   - Create a table with the following columns: Restaurant Name, Address, Distance from Harkness Memorial State Park, Closing Time on Wednesdays.\n   - Identify which restaurants are open past 10 PM on Wednesdays.\n   - Determine the closest restaurant among those that are open past 10 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n3. **Present the Final Answer**:\n   - Summarize the findings and provide the name, address, and distance of the closest eatery open at 11 PM on Wednesdays."}
