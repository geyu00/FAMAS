{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the link to the GFF3 file for beluga whales that was the most recent one on 20/10/2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is looking for a GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n   - The file should be the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific URL or location where the GFF3 file for beluga whales can be found.\n   - The database or repository that hosts genomic data for beluga whales, such as NCBI, Ensembl, or other relevant bioinformatics resources.\n   - The exact version or release date of the GFF3 file closest to 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining if there were multiple releases around the specified date and which one is the most recent.\n   - Verifying that the file format is indeed GFF3 and not another format like GTF or BED.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file for beluga whales is likely hosted on a major genomics database such as NCBI's GenBank or Ensembl.\n   - The most recent file as of 20/10/2020 might be part of a larger release or update cycle for marine mammal genomes.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020.\n  - Search query: \"most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales 20/10/2020\"\n  - Check reputable genomics databases such as NCBI, Ensembl, and other relevant resources.\n\n- **Step 2:** Once the relevant database or resource is identified, use WebSurfer to navigate to the specific page or section containing the GFF3 file.\n  - Verify the release date to ensure it is the most recent as of 20/10/2020.\n\n- **Step 3:** Extract the direct link to the GFF3 file from the identified page.\n  - Ensure the link is correct and points to the GFF3 file.\n\n- **Step 4:** If necessary, use FileSurfer to download and verify the GFF3 file locally.\n  - This step is optional but can be used to confirm the file's integrity and format.\n\n- **Step 5:** Provide the final link to the GFF3 file to the user."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the link to the GFF3 file for beluga whales that was the most recent one on 20/10/2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is looking for a GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n   - The file should be the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The current GFF3 file for beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) is available in the Ensembl FTP directory under `current_gff3/Delphinapterus_leucas`.\n   - The current GFF3 file is part of Ensembl Release 114 (May 2025).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific URL or location where the GFF3 file for beluga whales can be found for the most recent release as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The database or repository that hosts genomic data for beluga whales, such as NCBI, Ensembl, or other relevant bioinformatics resources, specifically for the release date of 20/10/2020.\n   - The exact version or release date of the GFF3 file closest to 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining if there were multiple releases around the specified date and which one is the most recent.\n   - Verifying that the file format is indeed GFF3 and not another format like GTF or BED.\n   - Identifying the historical releases section of the Ensembl FTP site to find the GFF3 file for the specified date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file for beluga whales is likely hosted on a major genomics database such as NCBI's GenBank or Ensembl.\n   - The most recent file as of 20/10/2020 might be part of a larger release or update cycle for marine mammal genomes.\n   - Given that the current GFF3 file is from Ensembl Release 114 (May 2025), it is likely that the most recent file as of 20/10/2020 is from a previous Ensembl release. We should check the historical releases section of the Ensembl FTP site to find the correct file.\n   - The historical releases section of the Ensembl FTP site is likely to be located in a directory such as `/pub/release-XX/` where `XX` is the release number corresponding to the date range around 20/10/2020.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Historical Releases Section**: Since the current GFF3 file is from a much later release (May 2025), it is logical to assume that the most recent file as of 20/10/2020 would be in a historical release. Ensembl typically archives older releases in a structured manner, often in directories named after the release number.\n- **Release Number**: To find the correct release, we need to identify the Ensembl release that was active around 20/10/2020. This can be done by checking the Ensembl release history or by navigating through the historical releases on the FTP site.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Navigate to the historical releases section of the Ensembl FTP site.\n2. Identify the release closest to 20/10/2020.\n3. Locate the GFF3 file for beluga whales in that release and provide the direct link.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigational Error**: We navigated to the wrong directories multiple times, such as `monodon_monoceros` and `anolis_carolinensis`, instead of staying focused on the `Delphinapterus_leucas` directory.\n2. **Lack of Historical Release Check**: We did not systematically check the historical releases section of the Ensembl FTP site to find the GFF3 file for the specified date (20/10/2020).\n3. **Insufficient Verification**: We did not verify the release dates of the files we found, leading to confusion about whether the files were from the correct time period.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Historical Releases Section**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Ensembl FTP site's main directory: `https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/`.\n   - Click on the `release-XX` directory that corresponds to the time period around 20/10/2020. (For example, `release-101` or `release-102`.)\n\n2. **Locate the Beluga Whale Directory**:\n   - Within the selected release directory, navigate to the `gff3` subdirectory.\n   - Find and click on the `Delphinapterus_leucas` directory.\n\n3. **Identify the Most Recent GFF3 File**:\n   - List the files in the `Delphinapterus_leucas` directory.\n   - Identify the GFF3 file with the most recent release date as of 20/10/2020.\n   - Verify the release date by checking the file names or any accompanying README files.\n\n4. **Provide the Direct Link**:\n   - Copy the direct link to the identified GFF3 file.\n   - Provide the link to the user.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Main FTP Directory**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Select the Appropriate Release Directory**:\n   - Look for the release directory that corresponds to the time period around 20/10/2020.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.click(\"release-101\")  # Adjust the release number as needed\n   ```\n\n3. **Navigate to the GFF3 Subdirectory**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.click(\"gff3\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Find the Beluga Whale Directory**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.click(\"Delphinapterus_leucas\")\n   ```\n\n5. **List and Identify the GFF3 File**:\n   - List the files in the directory.\n   - Identify the GFF3 file with the most recent release date as of 20/10/2020.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.list_files()\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   - Check the file names or any accompanying README files for the release date.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.click(\"README\")\n   WebSurfer.read_contents()\n   ```\n\n7. **Provide the Direct Link**:\n   - Copy the direct link to the identified GFF3 file.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.copy_link(\"Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.101.gff3.gz\")  # Adjust the file name as needed\n   ```\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to locate and provide the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020."}

All files are compressed using GNU Zip. Ensembl provides an automatic gene annotation for Balaenoptera musculus. For some species ( human, mouse, zebrafish, pig and rat), the annotation provided through Ensembl also includes manual annotation from HAVANA. In the case of human and mouse, the GTF files found here are equivalent to the GENCODE gene set. GFF3 flat file format dumping provides all the sequence features known by Ensembl, including protein coding genes, ncRNA, repeat features etc. Annotation is based on alignments of biological evidence (eg. proteins, cDNAs, RNA-seq) to a genome assembly. Annotation is based on alignments of biological evidence (eg. proteins, cDNAs, RNA-seq) to a genome assembly. The annotation dumped here is transcribed and translated from the genome assembly and is not the original input sequence data that we used for alignment. Therefore, the sequences provided by Ensembl may differ from the original input sequence data where the genome assembly is different to the aligned sequence. Considerably more information is stored in Ensembl: the flat file just gives a representation which is compatible with existing tools. We are considering other information that should be made dumpable. In general we would prefer people to use database access over flat file access if you want to do something serious with the data. Note the following features of the GFF3 format provided on this site: 1) types are described using SO terms that are as specific as possible. e.g. protein_coding_gene is used where a gene is known to be protein coding 2) Phase is currently set to 0 - the phase used by the Ensembl system is stored as an attribute 3) Some validators may warn about duplicated identifiers for CDS features. This is to allow split features to be grouped. We are actively working to improve our GFF3 so some of these issues may be addressed in future releases of Ensembl. Additionally, we provide a GFF3 file containing the predicted gene set as generated by Genscan and other abinitio prediction tools. This file is identified by the abinitio extension. ----------- FILE NAMES ------------ The files are consistently named following this pattern: <species>.<assembly>.<_version>.gff3.gz <species>: The systematic name of the species. <assembly>: The assembly build name. <version>: The version of Ensembl from which the data was exported. gff3 : All files in these directories are in GFF3 format gz : All files are compacted with GNU Zip for storage efficiency. e.g. Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.81.gff3.gz For the predicted gene set, an additional abinitio flag is added to the name file. <species>.<assembly>.<version>.abinitio.gff3.gz e.g. Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.81.abinitio.gff3.gz -------------------------------- Definition and supported options -------------------------------- GFF3 files are nine-column, tab-delimited, plain text files. Literal use of tab, newline, carriage return, the percent (%) sign, and control characters must be encoded using RFC 3986 Percent-Encoding; no other characters may be encoded. Backslash and other ad-hoc escaping conventions that have been added to the GFF format are not allowed. The file contents may include any character in the set supported by the operating environment, although for portability with other systems, use of Latin-1 or Unicode are recommended. Fields Fields are tab-separated. Also, all but the final field in each feature line must contain a valu; \"empty\" columns are denoted with a '.' seqid - The ID of the landmark used to establish the coordinate system for the current feature. IDs may contain any characters, but must escape any characters not in the set [a-zA-Z0-9.:^*!+_?-|]. In particular, IDs may not contain unescaped whitespace and must not begin with an unescaped \">\". source - The source is a free text qualifier intended to describe the algorithm or operating procedure that generated this feature. Typically this is the name of a piece of software, such as \"Genescan\" or a database name, such as \"Genbank.\" In effect, the source is used to extend the feature ontology by adding a qualifier to the type creating a new composite type that is a subclass of the type in the type column. type - The type of the feature (previously called the \"method\"). This is constrained to be either: (a)a term from the \"lite\" version of the Sequence Ontology - SOFA, a term from the full Sequence Ontology - it must be an is_a child of sequence_feature (SO:0000110) or (c) a SOFA or SO accession number. The latter alternative is distinguished using the syntax SO:000000. start - start position of the feature in positive 1-based integer coordinates always less than or equal to end end - end position of the feature in positive 1-based integer coordinates score - The score of the feature, a floating point number. As in earlier versions of the format, the semantics of the score are ill-defined. It is strongly recommended that E-values be used for sequence similarity features, and that P-values be used for ab initio gene prediction features. strand - The strand of the feature. + for positive strand (relative to the landmark), - for minus strand, and . for features that are not stranded. In addition, ? can be used for features whose strandedness is relevant, but unknown. phase - For features of type \"CDS\", the phase indicates where the feature begins with reference to the reading frame. The phase is one of the integers 0, 1, or 2, indicating the number of bases that should be removed from the beginning of this feature to reach the first base of the next codon. In other words, a phase of \"0\" indicates that the next codon begins at the first base of the region described by the current line, a phase of \"1\" indicates that the next codon begins at the second base of this region, and a phase of \"2\" indicates that the codon begins at the third base of this region. This is NOT to be confused with the frame, which is simply start modulo 3. attribute - A list of feature attributes in the format tag=value. Multiple tag=value pairs are separated by semicolons. URL escaping rules are used for tags or values containing the following characters: \",=;\". Spaces are allowed in this field, but tabs must be replaced with the %09 URL escape. Attribute values do not need to be and should not be quoted. The quotes should be included as part of the value by parsers and not stripped. Attributes The following attributes are available. All attributes are semi-colon separated pairs of keys and values. - ID: ID of the feature. IDs for each feature must be unique within the scope of the GFF file. In the case of discontinuous features (i.e. a single feature that exists over multiple genomic locations) the same ID may appear on multiple lines. All lines that share an ID collectively represent a single feature. - Name: Display name for the feature. This is the name to be displayed to the user. - Alias: A secondary name for the feature - Parent: Indicates the parent of the feature. A parent ID can be used to group exons into transcripts, transcripts into genes, and so forth - Dbxref: A database cross reference - Ontology_term: A cross reference to an ontology term - Is_circular: A flag to indicate whether a feature is circular Pragmas/Metadata GFF3 files can contain meta-data. In the case of experimental meta-data these are noted by a #!. Those which are stable are noted by a ##. Meta data is a single key, a space and then the value. Current meta data keys are: * genome-build - Build identifier of the assembly e.g. GRCh37.p11 * genome-version - Version of this assembly e.g. GRCh37 * genome-date - The date of the release of this assembly e.g. 2009-02 * genome-build-accession - The accession and source of this accession e.g. NCBI:GCA_000001405.14 * genebuild-last-updated - The date of the last genebuild update e.g. 2013-09 ------------------ Example GFF3 output ------------------ ##gff-version 3 #!genome-build Pmarinus_7.0 #!genome-version Pmarinus_7.0 #!genome-date 2011-01 #!genebuild-last-updated 2013-04 GL476399 Pmarinus_7.0 supercontig 1 4695893 . . .

All files are compressed using GNU Zip. Ensembl provides an automatic gene annotation for Balaenoptera musculus. For some species ( human, mouse, zebrafish, pig and rat), the annotation provided through Ensembl also includes manual annotation from HAVANA. In the case of human and mouse, the GTF files found here are equivalent to the GENCODE gene set. GFF3 flat file format dumping provides all the sequence features known by Ensembl, including protein coding genes, ncRNA, repeat features etc. Annotation is based on alignments of biological evidence (eg. proteins, cDNAs, RNA-seq) to a genome assembly. Annotation is based on alignments of biological evidence (eg. proteins, cDNAs, RNA-seq) to a genome assembly. The annotation dumped here is transcribed and translated from the genome assembly and is not the original input sequence data that we used for alignment. Therefore, the sequences provided by Ensembl may differ from the original input sequence data where the genome assembly is different to the aligned sequence. Considerably more information is stored in Ensembl: the flat file just gives a representation which is compatible with existing tools. We are considering other information that should be made dumpable. In general we would prefer people to use database access over flat file access if you want to do something serious with the data. Note the following features of the GFF3 format provided on this site: 1) types are described using SO terms that are as specific as possible. e.g. protein_coding_gene is used where a gene is known to be protein coding 2) Phase is currently set to 0 - the phase used by the Ensembl system is stored as an attribute 3) Some validators may warn about duplicated identifiers for CDS features. This is to allow split features to be grouped. We are actively working to improve our GFF3 so some of these issues may be addressed in future releases of Ensembl. Additionally, we provide a GFF3 file containing the predicted gene set as generated by Genscan and other abinitio prediction tools. This file is identified by the abinitio extension. ----------- FILE NAMES ------------ The files are consistently named following this pattern: <species>.<assembly>.<_version>.gff3.gz <species>: The systematic name of the species. <assembly>: The assembly build name. <version>: The version of Ensembl from which the data was exported. gff3 : All files in these directories are in GFF3 format gz : All files are compacted with GNU Zip for storage efficiency. e.g. Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.81.gff3.gz For the predicted gene set, an additional abinitio flag is added to the name file. <species>.<assembly>.<version>.abinitio.gff3.gz e.g. Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.81.abinitio.gff3.gz -------------------------------- Definition and supported options -------------------------------- GFF3 files are nine-column, tab-delimited, plain text files. Literal use of tab, newline, carriage return, the percent (%) sign, and control characters must be encoded using RFC 3986 Percent-Encoding; no other characters may be encoded. Backslash and other ad-hoc escaping conventions that have been added to the GFF format are not allowed. The file contents may include any character in the set supported by the operating environment, although for portability with other systems, use of Latin-1 or Unicode are recommended. Fields Fields are tab-separated. Also, all but the final field in each feature line must contain a valu; \"empty\" columns are denoted with a '.' seqid - The ID of the landmark used to establish the coordinate system for the current feature. IDs may contain any characters, but must escape any characters not in the set [a-zA-Z0-9.:^*!+_?-|]. In particular, IDs may not contain unescaped whitespace and must not begin with an unescaped \">\". source - The source is a free text qualifier intended to describe the algorithm or operating procedure that generated this feature. Typically this is the name of a piece of software, such as \"Genescan\" or a database name, such as \"Genbank.\" In effect, the source is used to extend the feature ontology by adding a qualifier to the type creating a new composite type that is a subclass of the type in the type column. type - The type of the feature (previously called the \"method\"). This is constrained to be either: (a)a term from the \"lite\" version of the Sequence Ontology - SOFA, a term from the full Sequence Ontology - it must be an is_a child of sequence_feature (SO:0000110) or (c) a SOFA or SO accession number. The latter alternative is distinguished using the syntax SO:000000. start - start position of the feature in positive 1-based integer coordinates always less than or equal to end end - end position of the feature in positive 1-based integer coordinates score - The score of the feature, a floating point number. As in earlier versions of the format, the semantics of the score are ill-defined. It is strongly recommended that E-values be used for sequence similarity features, and that P-values be used for ab initio gene prediction features. strand - The strand of the feature. + for positive strand (relative to the landmark), - for minus strand, and . for features that are not stranded. In addition, ? can be used for features whose strandedness is relevant, but unknown. phase - For features of type \"CDS\", the phase indicates where the feature begins with reference to the reading frame. The phase is one of the integers 0, 1, or 2, indicating the number of bases that should be removed from the beginning of this feature to reach the first base of the next codon. In other words, a phase of \"0\" indicates that the next codon begins at the first base of the region described by the current line, a phase of \"1\" indicates that the next codon begins at the second base of this region, and a phase of \"2\" indicates that the codon begins at the third base of this region. This is NOT to be confused with the frame, which is simply start modulo 3. attribute - A list of feature attributes in the format tag=value. Multiple tag=value pairs are separated by semicolons. URL escaping rules are used for tags or values containing the following characters: \",=;\". Spaces are allowed in this field, but tabs must be replaced with the %09 URL escape. Attribute values do not need to be and should not be quoted. The quotes should be included as part of the value by parsers and not stripped. Attributes The following attributes are available. All attributes are semi-colon separated pairs of keys and values. - ID: ID of the feature. IDs for each feature must be unique within the scope of the GFF file. In the case of discontinuous features (i.e. a single feature that exists over multiple genomic locations) the same ID may appear on multiple lines. All lines that share an ID collectively represent a single feature. - Name: Display name for the feature. This is the name to be displayed to the user. - Alias: A secondary name for the feature - Parent: Indicates the parent of the feature. A parent ID can be used to group exons into transcripts, transcripts into genes, and so forth - Dbxref: A database cross reference - Ontology_term: A cross reference to an ontology term - Is_circular: A flag to indicate whether a feature is circular Pragmas/Metadata GFF3 files can contain meta-data. In the case of experimental meta-data these are noted by a #!. Those which are stable are noted by a ##. Meta data is a single key, a space and then the value. Current meta data keys are: * genome-build - Build identifier of the assembly e.g. GRCh37.p11 * genome-version - Version of this assembly e.g. GRCh37 * genome-date - The date of the release of this assembly e.g. 2009-02 * genome-build-accession - The accession and source of this accession e.g. NCBI:GCA_000001405.14 * genebuild-last-updated - The date of the last genebuild update e.g. 2013-09 ------------------ Example GFF3 output ------------------ ##gff-version 3 #!genome-build Pmarinus_7.0 #!genome-version Pmarinus_7.0 #!genome-date 2011-01 #!genebuild-last-updated 2013-04 GL476399 Pmarinus_7.0 supercontig 1 4695893 . . .

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the link to the GFF3 file for beluga whales that was the most recent one on 20/10/2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is looking for a GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n   - The file should be the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The current GFF3 file for beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) is available in the Ensembl FTP directory under `current_gff3/Delphinapterus_leucas`.\n   - The current GFF3 file is part of Ensembl Release 114 (May 2025).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific URL or location where the GFF3 file for beluga whales can be found for the most recent release as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The database or repository that hosts genomic data for beluga whales, such as NCBI, Ensembl, or other relevant bioinformatics resources, specifically for the release date of 20/10/2020.\n   - The exact version or release date of the GFF3 file closest to 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining if there were multiple releases around the specified date and which one is the most recent.\n   - Verifying that the file format is indeed GFF3 and not another format like GTF or BED.\n   - Identifying the historical releases section of the Ensembl FTP site to find the GFF3 file for the specified date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file for beluga whales is likely hosted on a major genomics database such as NCBI's GenBank or Ensembl.\n   - The most recent file as of 20/10/2020 might be part of a larger release or update cycle for marine mammal genomes.\n   - Given that the current GFF3 file is from Ensembl Release 114 (May 2025), it is likely that the most recent file as of 20/10/2020 is from a previous Ensembl release. We should check the historical releases section of the Ensembl FTP site to find the correct file.\n   - The historical releases section of the Ensembl FTP site is likely to be located in a directory such as `/pub/release-XX/` where `XX` is the release number corresponding to the date range around 20/10/2020.\n   - Based on the Ensembl release schedule, Ensembl Release 101 was active around the time of 20/10/2020. This release was published in August 2020, which is close to the requested date.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Historical Releases Section**: Since the current GFF3 file is from a much later release (May 2025), it is logical to assume that the most recent file as of 20/10/2020 would be in a historical release. Ensembl typically archives older releases in a structured manner, often in directories named after the release number.\n- **Release Number**: Ensembl Release 101 was published in August 2020, which is very close to the requested date of 20/10/2020. This makes it a strong candidate for the most recent release containing the GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n- **File Format**: The GFF3 format is commonly used for genomic annotations, and Ensembl is known to provide GFF3 files for its annotated genomes.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the Historical Releases Section**:\n   - Use the Ensembl FTP site to navigate to the `release-101` directory.\n   - Specifically, go to `https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-101/gff3/`.\n\n2. **Locate the Beluga Whale Directory**:\n   - Within the `release-101/gff3` directory, look for the `Delphinapterus_leucas` directory.\n\n3. **Identify the Most Recent GFF3 File**:\n   - List the files in the `Delphinapterus_leucas` directory.\n   - Identify the GFF3 file with the most recent release date as of 20/10/2020.\n\n4. **Provide the Direct Link**:\n   - Copy the direct link to the identified GFF3 file.\n   - Provide the link to the user.\n\n### Action Items:\n1. **Navigate to the `release-101` Directory**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-101/gff3/\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Find the `Delphinapterus_leucas` Directory**:\n   - Once in the `release-101/gff3` directory, look for the `Delphinapterus_leucas` directory.\n\n3. **List and Identify the GFF3 File**:\n   - List the files in the `Delphinapterus_leucas` directory.\n   - Identify the GFF3 file with the most recent release date as of 20/10/2020.\n\n4. **Copy and Provide the Direct Link**:\n   - Copy the direct link to the identified GFF3 file.\n   - Provide the link to the user.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step:\n\n```sh\nWebSurfer.navigate(\"https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-101/gff3/\")\n```\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**:\n   - We repeatedly navigated to incorrect directories (e.g., `homo_sapiens`, `balaenoptera_musculus`) instead of the `Delphinapterus_leucas` directory.\n   - This was due to a lack of careful verification of the directory names and a focus on the wrong species.\n\n2. **Lack of Systematic Approach**:\n   - We did not systematically check the directories and files to ensure we were in the correct location.\n   - We did not verify the presence of the `Delphinapterus_leucas` directory before proceeding to other actions.\n\n3. **Inadequate Verification**:\n   - We did not double-check the directory names and file lists to ensure they matched the expected content.\n   - This led to confusion and repeated errors in navigation.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Main FTP Directory**:\n   - Ensure we start from the correct main directory.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Select the Appropriate Release Directory**:\n   - Navigate to the `release-101` directory, which is the most relevant release for the date 20/10/2020.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.click(\"release-101\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Navigate to the GFF3 Subdirectory**:\n   - Click on the `gff3` subdirectory to access the GFF3 files.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.click(\"gff3\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Locate the Beluga Whale Directory**:\n   - Carefully search for and click on the `Delphinapterus_leucas` directory.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.click(\"Delphinapterus_leucas\")\n   ```\n\n5. **List and Identify the GFF3 File**:\n   - List the files in the `Delphinapterus_leucas` directory.\n   - Identify the GFF3 file with the most recent release date as of 20/10/2020.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.list_files()\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify the File**:\n   - Double-check the file name and date to ensure it is the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n   - If necessary, read the contents of any README files to confirm the release date.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.read_contents(\"README\")\n   ```\n\n7. **Provide the Direct Link**:\n   - Copy the direct link to the identified GFF3 file.\n   - Provide the link to the user.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.copy_link(\"Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.101.gff3.gz\")\n   ```\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Main FTP Directory**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Select the Appropriate Release Directory**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.click(\"release-101\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Navigate to the GFF3 Subdirectory**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.click(\"gff3\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Locate the Beluga Whale Directory**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.click(\"Delphinapterus_leucas\")\n   ```\n\n5. **List and Identify the GFF3 File**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.list_files()\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify the File**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.read_contents(\"README\")\n   ```\n\n7. **Provide the Direct Link**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.copy_link(\"Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.101.gff3.gz\")\n   ```\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to locate and provide the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020 without repeating the previous mistakes."}
