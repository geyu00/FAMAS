{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The IMDB ratings for each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Vudu (Fandango at Home).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest IMDB rating among the films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Vudu/Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has a significant body of work, and it is likely that several of her films meet the runtime requirement.\n   - Popular and critically acclaimed films are more likely to be available on major streaming platforms like Vudu/Fandango at Home.\n   - Some of her most famous films, such as \"The Story of Adele H.\" or \"Camille Claudel,\" might be among the top-rated and available options.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: WebSurfer**\n  - Perform a web search to find a comprehensive list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n  - Visit IMDB to gather the IMDB ratings and runtimes for each of these films.\n\n- **Step 2: WebSurfer**\n  - Visit the Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) website to check the availability of each film that meets the runtime and rating criteria.\n\n- **Step 3: Assistant**\n  - Compile the data gathered by WebSurfer to identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n\n- **Step 4: Assistant**\n  - Verify the final selection and provide the name, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability link on Fandango at Home.\n\n- **Step 5: Optional - FileSurfer (if needed)**\n  - If necessary, use FileSurfer to save the compiled data for future reference or to generate a report."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The IMDB ratings for each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Vudu (Fandango at Home).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest IMDB rating among the films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Vudu/Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has a significant body of work, and it is likely that several of her films meet the runtime requirement.\n   - Popular and critically acclaimed films are more likely to be available on major streaming platforms like Vudu/Fandango at Home.\n   - Some of her most famous films, such as \"The Story of Adele H.\" or \"Camille Claudel,\" might be among the top-rated and available options.\n   - Based on the IMDb page, \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) and \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) are highly rated and are likely to be less than 2 hours long.\n   - \"Possession\" (1981) is another highly rated film that might meet the criteria.\n   - \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979) is also a well-known film and could be a strong candidate.\n\n5. **NEW INFORMATION**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has appeared in 30 films since 1970.\n   - Some of her notable films include \"Possession\" (1981), \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979), \"Camille Claudel\" (1988), and \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975).\n   - These films are known for their critical acclaim and are likely to have high IMDB ratings.\n\n6. **NEXT STEPS**\n   - Visit the IMDb pages for \"The Story of Adele H.,\" \"Camille Claudel,\" \"Possession,\" and \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" to confirm their runtimes and IMDB ratings.\n   - Check the availability of these films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\nBy focusing on these specific films, we can efficiently narrow down the list and find the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Scrolling**: The repeated scrolling down the IMDb page did not yield the necessary information about the films, their ratings, and runtimes efficiently.\n2. **Lack of Specificity**: The search was too broad, and we did not focus on specific films that were likely to meet the criteria.\n3. **No Clear Plan for Data Collection**: There was no structured approach to collect and verify the required data (ratings, runtimes, and availability).\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Identify Key Films**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to identify the top-rated Isabelle Adjani films on IMDb.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the IMDb pages for the identified films to gather their ratings and runtimes.\n\n2. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified film, confirm the runtime and ensure it is less than 2 hours.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) website to check the availability of each film that meets the runtime and rating criteria.\n\n4. **Compile and Verify Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the data gathered by WebSurfer to identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the final selection and provide the name, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability link on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Identify Key Films**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"top-rated Isabelle Adjani films IMDb\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the IMDb pages for the top-rated films identified in the search results.\n\n2. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each film, scroll to the technical specifications section to find the runtime.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the runtime and ensure it is less than 2 hours.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Fandango at Home website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for each film that meets the runtime and rating criteria.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the availability (buy/rent) and the price if available.\n\n4. **Compile and Verify Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Create a list of films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the highest-rated film from the list.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the name, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability link on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Example Script for WebSurfer\n\n```python\n# Example script to guide WebSurfer through the process\n\n# Step 1: Identify Key Films\nweb_search(\"top-rated Isabelle Adjani films IMDb\")\n\n# Step 2: Filter by Runtime\nfor film in top_rated_films:\n    visit_imdb_page(film)\n    runtime = get_runtime()\n    if runtime < 120:\n        # Step 3: Check Availability on Fandango at Home\n        visit_fandango_at_home()\n        search_film(film)\n        availability = check_availability()\n        if availability:\n            # Step 4: Compile and Verify Data\n            compile_data(film, runtime, availability)\n\n# Step 4: Identify the highest-rated film\nhighest_rated_film = identify_highest_rated_film(compiled_data)\nprovide_final_selection(highest_rated_film)\n```\n\n### Notes\n- **Efficiency**: Focus on a small set of top-rated films to avoid unnecessary scrolling and data collection.\n- **Structure**: Use a structured approach to gather and verify data for each film.\n- **Verification**: Double-check the final selection to ensure all criteria are met."}

However, when they begin to notice that their merchandise mysteriously disappears, a shadow of betrayal looms over them. What seemed to be a solid empire begins to falter, and the atmosphere of distrust grows among their closest collaborators. Suspicions about the members of their team intensify: Is it Maya, the cunning operative with a smile she never stops flashing? Or perhaps Anabel, the accountant who knows all the money movements and has access to the darkest secrets of the organization? No one is safe. Paranoia takes over the situation as Ariana and Sofia struggle to discover who is behind the sabotage before the betrayal destroys them completely. As the pressure mounts, the mothers and leaders must face a deadly dilemma: will they be able to unmask the traitor in his own home, or will they fall into the same trap that has been laid for them? In a world where power is held in blood and loyalty does not exist, the price of betrayal is higher than they ever imagined. The outcome could change the rules of the game forever.\n17.

Their network of operations is impenetrable, their contacts essential, and their control over the business absolute. However, when they begin to notice that their merchandise mysteriously disappears, a shadow of betrayal looms over them. What seemed to be a solid empire begins to falter, and the atmosphere of distrust grows among their closest collaborators. Suspicions about the members of their team intensify: Is it Maya, the cunning operative with a smile she never stops flashing? Or perhaps Anabel, the accountant who knows all the money movements and has access to the darkest secrets of the organization? No one is safe. Paranoia takes over the situation as Ariana and Sofia struggle to discover who is behind the sabotage before the betrayal destroys them completely. As the pressure mounts, the mothers and leaders must face a deadly dilemma: will they be able to unmask the traitor in his own home, or will they fall into the same trap that has been laid for them? In a world where power is held in blood and loyalty does not exist, the price of betrayal is higher than they ever imagined. The outcome could change the rules of the game forever.\n17.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n- The film must have an IMDB rating.\n- The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n- The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n- The IMDB ratings for each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n- The runtime of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n- The availability of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Vudu (Fandango at Home).\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The highest IMDB rating among the films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Vudu/Fandango at Home).\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Isabelle Adjani has a significant body of work, and it is likely that several of her films meet the runtime requirement.\n- Popular and critically acclaimed films are more likely to be available on major streaming platforms like Vudu/Fandango at Home.\n- Some of her most famous films, such as \"The Story of Adele H.\" or \"Camille Claudel,\" might be among the top-rated and available options.\n- Based on the IMDb page, \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) and \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) are highly rated and are likely to be less than 2 hours long.\n- \"Possession\" (1981) is another highly rated film that might meet the criteria.\n- \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979) is also a well-known film and could be a strong candidate.\n- Given the critical acclaim and historical significance of these films, they are likely to be available on major platforms.\n\n#### 5. NEW INFORMATION\n- Isabelle Adjani has appeared in 30 films since 1970.\n- Some of her notable films include \"Possession\" (1981), \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979), \"Camille Claudel\" (1988), and \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975).\n- These films are known for their critical acclaim and are likely to have high IMDB ratings.\n\n#### 6. NEXT STEPS\n- **Visit the IMDb pages for \"The Story of Adele H.,\" \"Camille Claudel,\" \"Possession,\" and \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" to confirm their runtimes and IMDB ratings.**\n- **Check the availability of these films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).**\n\n### Detailed Plan\n\n1. **Identify Key Films**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"top-rated Isabelle Adjani films IMDb\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the IMDb pages for the identified films to gather their ratings and runtimes.\n\n2. **Filter by Runtime**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified film, confirm the runtime and ensure it is less than 2 hours.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Fandango at Home website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for each film that meets the runtime and rating criteria.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the availability (buy/rent) and the price if available.\n\n4. **Compile and Verify Data**\n   - **Assistant**: Create a list of films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the highest-rated film from the list.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the name, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability link on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Example Script for WebSurfer\n\n```python\n# Example script to guide WebSurfer through the process\n\n# Step 1: Identify Key Films\nweb_search(\"top-rated Isabelle Adjani films IMDb\")\n\n# Step 2: Filter by Runtime\nfor film in top_rated_films:\n    visit_imdb_page(film)\n    runtime = get_runtime()\n    if runtime < 120:\n        # Step 3: Check Availability on Fandango at Home\n        visit_fandango_at_home()\n        search_film(film)\n        availability = check_availability()\n        if availability:\n            # Step 4: Compile and Verify Data\n            compile_data(film, runtime, availability)\n\n# Step 4: Identify the highest-rated film\nhighest_rated_film = identify_highest_rated_film(compiled_data)\nprovide_final_selection(highest_rated_film)\n```\n\n### Notes\n- **Efficiency**: Focus on a small set of top-rated films to avoid unnecessary scrolling and data collection.\n- **Structure**: Use a structured approach to gather and verify data for each film.\n- **Verification**: Double-check the final selection to ensure all criteria are met.\n\n### Immediate Action\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the IMDb pages for \"The Story of Adele H.,\" \"Camille Claudel,\" \"Possession,\" and \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" to confirm their runtimes and IMDB ratings.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Search Query**: The search query used did not specifically filter for Isabelle Adjani's films, leading to a list of films that do not necessarily include her.\n2. **Inefficient Data Extraction**: The data extraction process was not focused on the specific films we are interested in, leading to irrelevant results.\n3. **Lack of Structured Approach**: There was no clear structure to ensure that we systematically check each film for the required criteria (rating, runtime, availability).\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Query**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"Isabelle Adjani films IMDb\" to get a list of her films.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the IMDb page for Isabelle Adjani's filmography.\n\n2. **Extract Film List**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films from her IMDb page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each film, note the title and year.\n\n3. **Check Ratings and Runtimes**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the IMDb page for each film to gather the IMDb rating and runtime.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the runtime is less than 2 hours.\n\n4. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Fandango at Home website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for each film that meets the runtime and rating criteria.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the availability (buy/rent) and the price if available.\n\n5. **Compile and Verify Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Create a list of films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n   -

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Let's update the fact sheet to reflect the current situation and include any new insights or educated guesses.\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n- The film must have an IMDB rating.\n- The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n- The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n- The IMDB ratings for each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n- The runtime of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n- The availability of each of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Vudu (Fandango at Home).\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The highest IMDB rating among the films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Vudu/Fandango at Home).\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Isabelle Adjani has a significant body of work, and it is likely that several of her films meet the runtime requirement.\n- Popular and critically acclaimed films are more likely to be available on major streaming platforms like Vudu/Fandango at Home.\n- Some of her most famous films, such as \"The Story of Adele H.\" or \"Camille Claudel,\" might be among the top-rated and available options.\n- Based on the IMDb page, \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) and \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) are highly rated and are likely to be less than 2 hours long.\n- \"Possession\" (1981) is another highly rated film that might meet the criteria.\n- \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979) is also a well-known film and could be a strong candidate.\n- Given the critical acclaim and historical significance of these films, they are likely to be available on major platforms.\n- **New Guess**: Since the initial attempt to navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb page led to Neve Campbell's page, it is possible that there was a typo or a mistake in the URL. The correct URL for Isabelle Adjani's IMDb page is likely to be `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/`.\n\n#### 5. NEW INFORMATION\n- Isabelle Adjani has appeared in 30 films since 1970.\n- Some of her notable films include \"Possession\" (1981), \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979), \"Camille Claudel\" (1988), and \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975).\n- These films are known for their critical acclaim and are likely to have high IMDB ratings.\n\n#### 6. NEXT STEPS\n- **Correct the URL**: Navigate to the correct IMDb page for Isabelle Adjani using the URL `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/`.\n- **Extract Film List**: Once on the correct page, extract the titles and years of her feature films.\n- **Check Ratings and Runtimes**: For each film in the list, visit the IMDb page to gather the IMDb rating and runtime.\n- **Filter by Runtime**: Ensure the runtime is less than 2 hours.\n- **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**: Visit the Fandango at Home website and search for each film that meets the runtime and rating criteria.\n- **Compile and Verify Data**: Create a list of films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n- **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**: Identify the highest-rated film from the list and provide the name, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability link on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Detailed Plan\n\n1. **Correct the URL and Extract Film List**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/` to access Isabelle Adjani's IMDb page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the filmography section and extract the titles and years of her feature films.\n\n2. **Check Ratings and Runtimes**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each film in the list, visit the IMDb page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the IMDb rating and runtime.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Filter out films that are 2 hours or longer.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Fandango at Home website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for each film that meets the runtime and rating criteria.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the availability (buy/rent) and the price if available.\n\n4. **Compile and Verify Data**\n   - **Assistant**: Create a list of films that meet all the criteria (starring Isabelle Adjani, less than 2 hours, available on Fandango at Home).\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the highest-rated film from the list.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the name, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability link on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Example Script for WebSurfer\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Correct the URL and Extract Film List\nnavigate_to_url(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/\")\nscroll_down(1)\nfilm_list = []\nwhile True:\n    films = get_elements(\".lister-item-header a\")\n    if not films:\n        break\n    for film in films:\n        title = film.text\n        year = get_element(film, \".lister-item-year\").text\n        film_list.append((title, year))\n    scroll_down(1)\n\n# Step 2: Check Ratings and Runtimes\nfiltered_films = []\nfor title, year in film_list:\n    visit_imdb_page(title)\n    rating = get_element(\".ipl-rating-star__rating\").text\n    runtime = get_element(\".runtime\").text\n    if int(runtime.split()[0]) < 120:\n        filtered_films.append((title, year, rating, runtime))\n\n# Step 3: Check Availability on Fandango at Home\navailable_films = []\nfor title, year, rating, runtime in filtered_films:\n    visit_fandango_at_home()\n    search_film(title)\n    availability = check_availability()\n    if availability:\n        available_films.append((title, year, rating, runtime, availability))\n\n# Step 4: Compile and Verify Data\nhighest_rated_film = max(available_films, key=lambda x: float(x[2]))\nprovide_final_selection(highest_rated_film)\n```\n\n### Notes\n- **Efficiency**: Focus on a specific list of Isabelle Adjani's films to avoid irrelevant results.\n- **Structure**: Use a structured approach to ensure systematic data collection and verification.\n- **Verification**: Double-check the final selection to ensure all criteria are met.\n\n### Immediate Action\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/` to access Isabelle Adjani's IMDb page.\n- **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the filmography section and extract the titles and years of her feature films.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect URL**: The URL `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000117/` led to Neve Campbell's IMDb page instead of Isabelle Adjani's.
