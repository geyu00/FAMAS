{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The issue is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n   - The issue has the label \"Regression\".\n   - The issue is closed.\n   - We need to find the date in MM/DD/YY format when Regression was added to the oldest closed issue with the Regression label.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue in the `numpy.polynomial` repository on GitHub.\n   - The specific issue number and details of the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The date in MM/DD/YY format from the timestamp provided by GitHub for the addition of the \"Regression\" label.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is likely to be from a significant period back in the repository's history, possibly several years ago.\n   - The date format MM/DD/YY is a common way to represent dates in the United States, which might be the default format used by GitHub.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Oldest Closed Issue with the \"Regression\" Label:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the `numpy` GitHub repository.\n  - Search for issues labeled \"Regression\" and filter for closed issues.\n  - Identify the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n\n- **Find the Date When \"Regression\" Label Was Added:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to open the identified issue.\n  - Locate the timeline of the issue to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n  - Note the date in the format MM/DD/YY.\n\n- **Verify and Report the Date:**\n  - Confirm the date found is accurate.\n  - Report the date in the required format."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and new insights:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The issue is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n   - The issue has the label \"Regression\".\n   - The issue is closed.\n   - We need to find the date in MM/DD/YY format when Regression was added to the oldest closed issue with the Regression label.\n   - The search for closed issues with the \"Regression\" label using the query `is:issue state:closed label:Regression sort:created-asc` did not yield any results.\n   - The search for closed issues with both \"Regression\" and \"regression\" labels using the query `is:issue state:closed label:Regression label:regression sort:created-asc` also did not yield any results.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue in the `numpy.polynomial` repository on GitHub.\n   - The specific issue number and details of the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n   - Verify if there are any issues labeled with \"Regression\" in the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory specifically.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The date in MM/DD/YY format from the timestamp provided by GitHub for the addition of the \"Regression\" label.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label might be from a different part of the repository or might not be labeled consistently.\n   - The label \"Regression\" might be applied differently or might have been used inconsistently in the past.\n   - The `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory might have its own set of issues that are not being captured by the current search queries.\n   - The date format MM/DD/YY is a common way to represent dates in the United States, which might be the default format used by GitHub.\n\n**REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- Given that the search for issues with the \"Regression\" label did not yield any results, it is possible that the label is applied differently or inconsistently in the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory.\n- The `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory might have its own set of issues that are not being captured by the current search queries, which are broader and might not filter down to the specific subdirectory.\n- It is also possible that the label \"Regression\" was used differently in the past, and older issues might not have this label even if they are regressions.\n\nNext steps:\n- Try searching for issues specifically in the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory.\n- Check if there are any issues labeled with \"Regression\" in the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory.\n- If necessary, manually browse through the issues to identify any that might be relevant but not captured by the search queries.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Search Query**: The search queries used were too broad and did not specifically target issues related to `numpy.polynomial`. This led to no results being returned.\n- **Label Inconsistency**: There might be inconsistencies in how the \"Regression\" label is applied, especially in the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory.\n- **Subdirectory-Specific Issues**: The issues related to `numpy.polynomial` might be handled differently and might not be captured by the general search queries.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Refine Search Query**: Use a more specific search query to target issues related to `numpy.polynomial` and labeled with \"Regression\".\n- **Manual Verification**: Manually verify the results to ensure that the search is capturing the correct issues.\n- **Check Subdirectory**: Specifically search within the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory for issues labeled with \"Regression\".\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. **Refine the Search Query**:\n   - Use the search query `is:issue state:closed label:Regression path:numpy/polynomial` to target issues related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n2. **Perform the Search**:\n   - Navigate to the `numpy` GitHub repository.\n   - Enter the refined search query in the search bar.\n\n3. **Manually Verify Results**:\n   - Scroll through the search results to identify the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n   - Note the issue number and the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n4. **Check Subdirectory**:\n   - If no results are found, manually browse through the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory issues to check for any that might be relevant but not captured by the search query.\n\n5. **Report the Date**:\n   - Once the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is identified, report the date in MM/DD/YY format.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Use Specific Paths**: Ensure the search query includes the path to the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory.\n- **Manual Verification**: If the search does not return expected results, manually check the issues to avoid missing any due to label inconsistencies.\n- **Date Format**: Convert the date to MM/DD/YY format as required.\n\n### Updated Plan in Bullet Points\n\n- **Refine the Search Query**:\n  - Use the search query `is:issue state:closed label:Regression path:numpy/polynomial`.\n- **Perform the Search**:\n  - Navigate to the `numpy` GitHub repository.\n  - Enter the refined search query in the search bar.\n- **Manually Verify Results**:\n  - Scroll through the search results to identify the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n  - Note the issue number and the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Check Subdirectory**:\n  - If no results are found, manually browse through the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory issues.\n- **Report the Date**:\n  - Report the date in MM/DD/YY format."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and new insights:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The issue is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n   - The issue has the label \"Regression\".\n   - The issue is closed.\n   - We need to find the date in MM/DD/YY format when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue with the Regression label.\n   - The search for closed issues with the \"Regression\" label using the query `is:issue state:closed label:Regression sort:created-asc` did not yield any results.\n   - The search for closed issues with both \"Regression\" and \"regression\" labels using the query `is:issue state:closed label:Regression label:regression sort:created-asc` also did not yield any results.\n   - The search for closed issues in the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory using the query `is:issue state:closed path:numpy/polynomial` has been manually browsed through multiple pages, but no issues labeled with \"Regression\" have been found yet.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue in the `numpy.polynomial` repository on GitHub.\n   - The specific issue number and details of the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n   - Verify if there are any issues labeled with \"Regression\" in the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory specifically.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The date in MM/DD/YY format from the timestamp provided by GitHub for the addition of the \"Regression\" label.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label might be from a different part of the repository or might not be labeled consistently.\n   - The label \"Regression\" might be applied differently or might have been used inconsistently in the past.\n   - The `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory might have its own set of issues that are not being captured by the current search queries.\n   - The date format MM/DD/YY is a common way to represent dates in the United States, which might be the default format used by GitHub.\n   - It is possible that the \"Regression\" label was added to issues in the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory, but these issues are not appearing in the search results due to some filtering or indexing issue.\n   - The \"Regression\" label might have been added to issues in the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory, but the issues might be very old and not easily discoverable through the current search methods.\n\n### REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:\n- **Different Labeling Practices**: Given that the search for issues with the \"Regression\" label did not yield any results, it is possible that the label is applied differently or inconsistently in the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory.\n- **Subdirectory-Specific Issues**: The `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory might have its own set of issues that are not being captured by the current search queries, which are broader and might not filter down to the specific subdirectory.\n- **Older Issues**: It is also possible that the label \"Regression\" was used differently in the past, and older issues might not have this label even if they are regressions.\n- **Indexing or Filtering Issue**: There might be an issue with how GitHub indexes or filters issues, causing relevant issues to be missed in the search results.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Refine the Search Query**:\n   - Use a more specific search query to target issues related to `numpy.polynomial` and labeled with \"Regression\".\n   - Try the query `is:issue state:closed label:Regression path:numpy/polynomial` again, ensuring that the search is being performed correctly.\n\n2. **Manual Verification**:\n   - Continue manually browsing through the closed issues in the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory to check if any of them are labeled with \"Regression\".\n   - Note the issue number and the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n3. **Check Subdirectory**:\n   - Specifically search within the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory for issues labeled with \"Regression\".\n   - If no results are found, manually browse through the issues to ensure no relevant issues are missed.\n\n4. **Report the Date**:\n   - Once the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is identified, report the date in MM/DD/YY format.\n\n### Updated Plan in Bullet Points:\n- **Refine the Search Query**:\n  - Use the search query `is:issue state:closed label:Regression path:numpy/polynomial`.\n- **Perform the Search**:\n  - Navigate to the `numpy` GitHub repository.\n  - Enter the refined search query in the search bar.\n- **Manually Verify Results**:\n  - Scroll through the search results to identify the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n  - Note the issue number and the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Check Subdirectory**:\n  - If no results are found, manually browse through the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory issues.\n- **Report the Date**:\n  - Report the date in MM/DD/YY format.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Use Specific Paths**: Ensure the search query includes the path to the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory.\n- **Manual Verification**: If the search does not return expected results, manually check the issues to avoid missing any due to label inconsistencies.\n- **Date Format**: Convert the date to MM/DD/YY format as required.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Search Query Limitations**: The search queries used were too broad and did not specifically target issues related to `numpy.polynomial` with the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Manual Browsing Inefficiency**: Manually browsing through multiple pages of issues was time-consuming and did not yield the desired results.\n- **Label Consistency Issues**: The \"Regression\" label might be applied inconsistently or might not be present in the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine the Search Query**:\n   - Use a more specific search query to target issues related to `numpy.polynomial` and labeled with \"Regression\".\n   - Use the query `is:issue state:closed label:Regression path:numpy/polynomial` to narrow down the search.\n\n2. **Perform the Search**:\n   - Navigate to the `numpy` GitHub repository.\n   - Enter the refined search query in the search bar.\n\n3. **Manually Verify Results**:\n   - If the search query does not yield any results, manually browse through the closed issues in the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory.\n   - Start from the oldest issues and look for any labeled with \"Regression\".\n\n4. **Check for Alternative Labels**:\n   - If no issues are found with the \"Regression\" label, check for alternative labels that might indicate a regression (e.g., \"Bug\", \"Defect\").\n\n5. **Note the Issue Number and Date**:\n   - Once the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is identified, note the issue number and the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n6. **Report the Date**:\n   - Convert the date to MM/DD/YY format and report it.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Use Specific Paths**: Ensure the search query includes the path to the `numpy.polynomial` subdirectory.\n- **Manual Verification**: If the search does not return expected results, manually check the issues to avoid missing any due to label inconsistencies.\n- **Alternative Labels**: Consider checking for alternative labels that might indicate a regression.\n- **Date Format**: Convert the date to MM/DD/YY format as required.\n\n### Updated Plan in Bullet Points\n\n- **Refine the Search Query**:\n  -

Convert the date to MM/DD/YY format and report it."}
