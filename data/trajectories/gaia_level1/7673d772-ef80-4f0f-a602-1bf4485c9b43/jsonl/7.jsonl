{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nOn Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request refers to the Cornell Law School website's legal information institute.\n   - The focus is on the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n   - The question pertains to the last amendment to the first rule in the article with the most titles containing the word \"witnesses\" as of 2021.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically on the Cornell Law School website.\n   - The specific article within that section that has the most titles containing the word \"witnesses.\"\n   - The text of the first rule in that article.\n   - The history of amendments to that rule, specifically the last amendment as of 2021.\n   - The exact word that was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which article has the most titles containing the word \"witnesses\" based on the content available on the Cornell Law School website.\n   - Identifying the specific changes made in the last amendment to the first rule, particularly the word that was deleted.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically is likely to be \"Rules of Civil Procedure\" (given the common structure of legal documents).\n   - The article with the most titles containing \"witnesses\" is likely to be related to evidence or testimony, possibly Article III or IV of the Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   - The word deleted in the last amendment could be a common term used in legal contexts, such as \"testimony,\" \"deposition,\" or \"sworn.\"\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify the Fifth Section of Federal Rules Alphabetically**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Cornell Law School website's legal information institute and identify the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n\n- **Step 2: Find the Article with the Most Titles Containing \"Witnesses\"**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Within the identified section, locate the article that has the most titles containing the word \"witnesses.\"\n\n- **Step 3: Locate the First Rule in the Identified Article**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the first rule in the article found in Step 2.\n\n- **Step 4: Determine the Last Amendment to the First Rule as of 2021**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check the history of amendments to the first rule to find the last amendment made as of 2021.\n\n- **Step 5: Identify the Word Deleted in the Last Amendment**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Examine the details of the last amendment to determine the specific word that was deleted.\n\n- **Step 6: Verify and Report the Findings**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the findings and provide a clear and concise answer to the original request."}

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request refers to the Cornell Law School website's legal information institute.\n   - The focus is on the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n   - The question pertains to the last amendment to the first rule in the article with the most titles containing the word \"witnesses\" as of 2021.\n   - The sections of federal rules listed on the Cornell Law School website are:\n     - Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure\n     - Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n     - Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\n     - Federal Rules of Evidence\n     - Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure\n     - U.S. Supreme Court Rules\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically is \"Federal Rules of Evidence.\"\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific article within the Federal Rules of Evidence that has the most titles containing the word \"witnesses.\"\n   - The text of the first rule in that article.\n   - The history of amendments to that rule, specifically the last amendment as of 2021.\n   - The exact word that was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which article within the Federal Rules of Evidence has the most titles containing the word \"witnesses\" based on the content available on the Cornell Law School website.\n   - Identifying the specific changes made in the last amendment to the first rule, particularly the word that was deleted.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The article with the most titles containing \"witnesses\" is likely to be related to evidence or testimony, possibly Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which deals with witnesses.\n   - The word deleted in the last amendment could be a common term used in legal contexts, such as \"testimony,\" \"deposition,\" or \"sworn.\"\n   - The last amendment to the first rule in the relevant article might have been made to clarify or simplify the language, often involving terms that are redundant or overly technical.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Step 1: Identify the Article with the Most Titles Containing \"Witnesses\"**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Federal Rules of Evidence and identify the article with the most titles containing the word \"witnesses.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Locate the First Rule in the Identified Article**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the first rule in the article found in Step 1.\n\n- **Step 3: Determine the Last Amendment to the First Rule as of 2021**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check the history of amendments to the first rule to find the last amendment made as of 2021.\n\n- **Step 4: Identify the Word Deleted in the Last Amendment**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Examine the details of the last amendment to determine the specific word that was deleted.\n\n- **Step 5: Verify and Report the Findings**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the findings and provide a clear and concise answer to the original request.\n\nPlease proceed with the next step.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Repetition of Steps**: We repeatedly navigated to the Federal Rules of Evidence without confirming if it was indeed the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n- **Lack of Verification**: We did not verify the order of the sections before proceeding to the next steps.\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: We navigated back and forth between pages without a clear plan, leading to unnecessary repetition.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Step 1: Confirm the Fifth Section Alphabetically**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the main Federal Rules page and confirm the order of the sections alphabetically. Report back with the name of the fifth section.\n  \n- **Step 2: Identify the Article with the Most Titles Containing \"Witnesses\"**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the confirmed fifth section and identify the article with the most titles containing the word \"witnesses.\"\n  \n- **Step 3: Locate the First Rule in the Identified Article**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the first rule in the article found in Step 2.\n  \n- **Step 4: Determine the Last Amendment to the First Rule as of 2021**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check the history of amendments to the first rule to find the last amendment made as of 2021.\n  \n- **Step 5: Identify the Word Deleted in the Last Amendment**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Examine the details of the last amendment to determine the specific word that was deleted.\n  \n- **Step 6: Verify and Report the Findings**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the findings and provide a clear and concise answer to the original request.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Prior Challenges\n- **Verify Each Step Before Proceeding**: Ensure that each step is correctly completed and verified before moving on to the next step.\n- **Clear Navigation**: Use clear and specific instructions for navigating the website to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth.\n- **Document Progress**: Keep a record of each step and its outcome to avoid repetition and ensure clarity.\n\nPlease proceed with the first step."}

Competency to Testify in General \n Rule 601. Competency to Testify in General \n Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise. But in a civil case, state law governs the witness’s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision. \n Notes \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds of incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are religious belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the litigation as a party or interested person or spouse of a party or interested person. With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's Acts, American jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize these grounds. \n The Dead Man's Acts are surviving traces of the common law disqualification of parties and interested persons. They exist in variety too great to convey conviction of their wisdom and effectiveness. These rules contain no provision of this kind. For the reasoning underlying the decision not to give effect to state statutes in diversity cases, see the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 501. \n No mental or moral qualifications for testifying as a witness are specified. Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore §§501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty.

Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore §§501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty. This result may, however, be accomplished more directly, and without haggling in terms of legal standards, by the manner of administering the oath or affirmation under Rule 603. \n Admissibility of religious belief as a ground of impeachment is treated in Rule 610. Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93–650 \n Rule 601 as submitted to the Congress provided that “Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules.” One effect of the Rule as proposed would have been to abolish age, mental capacity, and other grounds recognized in some State jurisdictions as making a person incompetent as a witness. The greatest controversy centered around the Rule's rendering inapplicable in the federal courts the so-called Dead Man's Statutes which exist in some States. Acknowledging that there is substantial disagreement as to the merit of Dead Man's Statutes, the Committee nevertheless believed that where such statutes have been enacted they represent State policy which should not be overturned in the absence of a compelling federal interest. The Committee therefore amended the Rule to make competency in civil actions determinable in accordance with State law with respect to elements of claims or defenses as to which State law supplies the rule of decision. Cf. \n Courtland v. Walston & Co., Inc  ., 340 F.Supp. 1076, 1087–1092 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93–1277 \n The amendment to rule 601 parallels the treatment accorded rule 501 discussed immediately above. \n Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No. 93–1597 \n Rule 601 deals with competency of witnesses. Both the House and Senate bills provide that federal competency law applies in criminal cases. In civil actions and proceedings, the House bill provides that state competency law applies “to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision.” The Senate bill provides that “in civil actions and proceedings arising under \n 28 U.S.C. §1332  or \n 28 U.S.C. §1335  , or between citizens of different States and removed under \n 28 U.S.C. §1441(b)  the competency of a witness, person, government, State or political subdivision thereof is determined in accordance with State law, unless with respect to the particular claim or defense, Federal law supplies the rule of decision.” \n The wording of the House and Senate bills differs in the treatment of civil actions and proceedings. The rule in the House bill applies to evidence that relates to “an element of a claim or defense.” If an item of proof tends to support or defeat a claim or defense, or an element of a claim or defense, and if state law supplies the rule of decision for that claim or defense, then state competency law applies to that item of proof. \n For reasons similar to those underlying its action on Rule 501, the Conference adopts the House provision. \n Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment \nSponsored ListingsAdam Dayan\nPREMIUM\nSan Antonio, TXImmigration Law\nWebsite\nEmail\nProfile\nMohammad Abuershaid\nPREMIUM\n(866) 811-4255Los Angeles, CACriminal Law, DUI & DWI, Personal Injury, Juvenile Law, Domestic Violence, White Collar Crime\nWebsite\nEmail\nProfile\nHaleh Shekarchian\nPREMIUM\n(800) 692-9080Beverly Hills, CAPersonal Injury, Workers' Compensation\nWebsite\nEmail\nProfile\nSeppi Esfandi\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The restyling is intended to be nonsubstantive. \n Committee Notes on Rules—1972 \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds of incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are religious belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the litigation as a party or interested person or spouse of a party or interested person. With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's Acts, American jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize these grounds. \n The Dead Man's Acts are surviving traces of the common law disqualification of parties and interested persons. They exist in variety too great to convey conviction of their wisdom and effectiveness. These rules contain no provision of this kind. For the reasoning underlying the decision not to give effect to state statutes in diversity cases, see the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 501. \n No mental or moral qualifications for testifying as a witness are specified. Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore §§501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty. This result may, however, be accomplished more directly, and without haggling in terms of legal standards, by the manner of administering the oath or affirmation under Rule 603. \n Admissibility of religious belief as a ground of impeachment is treated in Rule 610. Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93–650 \n Rule 601 as submitted to the Congress provided that “Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules.” One effect of the Rule as proposed would have been to abolish age, mental capacity, and other grounds recognized in some State jurisdictions as making a person incompetent as a witness. The greatest controversy centered around the Rule's rendering inapplicable in the federal courts the so-called Dead Man's Statutes which exist in some States. Acknowledging that there is substantial disagreement as to the merit of Dead Man's Statutes, the Committee nevertheless believed that where such statutes have been enacted they represent State policy which should not be overturned in the absence of a compelling federal interest. The Committee therefore amended the Rule to make competency in civil actions determinable in accordance with State law with respect to elements of claims or defenses as to which State law supplies the rule of decision. Cf. \n Courtland v. Walston & Co., Inc  ., 340 F.Supp. 1076, 1087–1092 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93–1277 \n The amendment to rule 601 parallels the treatment accorded rule 501 discussed immediately above. \n Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No. 93–1597 \n Rule 601 deals with competency of witnesses. Both the House and Senate bills provide that federal competency law applies in criminal cases. In civil actions and proceedings, the House bill provides that state competency law applies “to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision.” The Senate bill provides that “in civil actions and proceedings arising under \n 28 U.S.C. §1332  or \n 28 U.S.C. §1335  , or between citizens of different States and removed under \n 28 U.S.C. §1441(b)  the competency of a witness, person, government, State or political subdivision thereof is determined in accordance with State law, unless with respect to the particular claim or defense, Federal law supplies the rule of decision.” \n The wording of the House and Senate bills differs in the treatment of civil actions and proceedings. The rule in the House bill applies to evidence that relates to “an element of a claim or defense.” If an item of proof tends to support or defeat a claim or defense, or an element of a claim or defense, and if state law supplies the rule of decision for that claim or defense, then state competency law applies to that item of proof. \n For reasons similar to those underlying its action on Rule 501, the Conference adopts the House provision. \n Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment \n The language of Rule 601 has been amended as part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility. \n Changes Made After Publication and Comments \n No changes were made after publication and comments. \n Committee Notes on Rules—2007 Amendment \n The language of Rule 601 is amended to make it consistent with the restyled Rules of Civil Procedure and Rules of Criminal Procedure. The restyling is intended to be nonsubstantive. \n Committee Notes on Rules—1972 \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>\n\nFrom the 'Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment' section, it is clear that the 2011 amendment was primarily stylistic and intended to make the rule more easily understood. The specific word that was deleted in the last amendment to Rule 601 as of 2021 is **\"otherwise\"**. The phrase \"Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules\" was changed to \"Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise.\"\n\nThus, the word that was deleted is **\"otherwise\"**."}
