It developed after the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169 from Middle English, Norman French and Flemish, with influences from Irish.What does Yola mean?\nThe name Yola means \"old\". By late the 19th century Yola was disappearing as a community language, however it continued to be used occsionally songs into the 21st century. Some Yola words are also used in the English dialect of south Wexford. Note: there appears to be some variation in how words are written in Yola.How is th pronounced in Yola?\nAswell, The way /th/ is pronounced in Yola is more of a /d/ or a /dh/. There are some recovered documents from the time when the Yola language was commonly spoken in the baronies. The most famous of which are the “Yola Hurling Zong” and “The Maiden of Rosslare”.How did the Yola language change over time?\nAlthough it was isolated, the Yola language took up many Irish loanwords over time. The “Proto-Yola” language was first theoretically born when the Norman invasion of the area first started. Over time this new language Why are /Zi/ and /as/ so common in the Yola language?\nA theory of why /zi/ and /aɹs/ are so common in the Yola language is because of this. Many traditions from Normandy came to the Yoles, such as the practice of Mumming, which is a type of acting, usually for a holiday. Language revitalization is an option for the Yola Language.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"SystemEntropyOriginTrialToken\": \"A5is4nwJJVnhaJpUr1URgj4vvAXSiHoK0VBbM9fawMskbDUj9WUREpa3JzGAo6xd1Cp2voQEG1h6NQ71AsMznU8AAABxeyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaW5nLmNvbTo0NDMiLCJmZWF0dXJlIjoiTXNVc2VyQWdlbnRMYXVuY2hOYXZUeXBlIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNzUzNzQ3MjAwLCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZX0=\",\n        \"ConfidenceOriginTrialToken\": \"Aqw360MHzRcmtEVv55zzdIWcTk2BBYHcdBAOysNJZP4qkN8M+5vUq36ITHFVst8LiX36KBZJXB8xvyBgdK2z5Q0AAAB6eyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL2JpbmcuY29tOjQ0MyIsImZlYXR1cmUiOiJQZXJmb3JtYW5jZU5hdmlnYXRpb25UaW1pbmdDb25maWRlbmNlIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNzYwNDAwMDAwLCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZX0=\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Bing \\u7684\\u667a\\u6167\\u578b\\u641c\\u5c0b\\u53ef\\u8b93\\u60a8\\u66f4\\u8f15\\u800c\\u6613\\u8209\\u627e\\u5230\\u60f3\\u627e\\u7684\\u8cc7\\u8a0a\\uff0c\\u540c\\u6642\\u9084\\u56e0\\u6b64\\u7372\\u5f97\\u734e\\u52f5\\u3002\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Bing\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Yola word gimlie Latin root Spanish equivalent - Bing\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.bing.com/search?q=Yola+word+gimlie+Latin+root+Spanish+equivalent&form=QBLH&sp=-1&lq=0&pq=&sc=0-0&qs=n&sk=&cvid=2E9D6F27BAA34D4C92EAE2EC758C6C59\",\n        \"fb:app_id\": \"3732605936979161\",\n        \"og:image\": \"http://www.bing.com/sa/simg/facebook_sharing_5.png\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"600\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"315\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and insights gained:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request involves the Yola word \"gimlie\"\n   - The Latin root of \"gimlie\" is \"camināta\"\n   - The Spanish word \"chimenea\" shares the same spelling as the Latin root \"camināta\"\n   - The source is the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online\n   - The year 1994 is mentioned as part of an example sentence\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The 1994 example sentence for the Spanish word \"chimenea\" in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online\n   - The Google translation of the source title for the 1994 example sentence\n\n3.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe Latin root of the Yola word \"gimlie\" shares a spelling with a Spanish word. What is the Google translation of the source title for the 1994 example sentence for that word in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online? Answer in plain text, without punctuation.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request involves the Yola word \"gimlie\"\n- The Latin root of \"gimlie\" is \"camināta\"\n- The Spanish word \"chimenea\" shares the same spelling as the Latin root \"camināta\"\n- The source is the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online\n- The year 1994 is mentioned as part of an example sentence\n- Accessing the Collins dictionary page for \"chimenea\" triggers a security check by Cloudflare\n- The security check requires manual interaction, such as solving a CAPTCHA\n- The security check is a significant barrier and has been consistently triggered when attempting to access the Collins dictionary page\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The 1994 example sentence for the Spanish word \"chimenea\" in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online\n- The Google translation of the source title for the 1994 example sentence\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The exact meaning or context of the Yola word \"gimlie\" in relation to its Latin root \"camināta\"\n- The relevance of the 1994 example sentence to the Spanish word \"chimenea\"\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The Yola language is likely a lesser-known dialect or language, which may not have extensive documentation\n- The Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online is a reliable source for finding the example sentence and its context\n- The Google translation will likely provide a straightforward translation of the source title, assuming it is a common or well-documented text\n- The 1994 example sentence might be from a literary work or a well-known text, given the specific year mentioned. This could help in narrowing down the search for the source title\n- The security check by Cloudflare is a standard measure to prevent automated bots and may require manual intervention, such as solving a CAPTCHA, to proceed\n- Using a different browser or device might bypass the security check, as the check is often tied to the specific user agent or IP address\n- The security check might also be triggered by the frequency of requests or the nature of the user agent being used. Therefore, spacing out requests or using a more standard user agent could help\n- The security check might be less likely to trigger if the request is made from a residential IP address rather than a data center IP address\n\n### Explanation of Updates:\n- **Given or Verified Facts:**\n  - Confirmed that the security check is a consistent and significant barrier.\n  - Added that the security check has been consistently triggered when attempting to access the Collins dictionary page.\n\n- **Facts to Look Up:**\n  - No changes needed.\n\n- **Facts to Derive:**\n  - No changes needed.\n\n- **Educated Guesses:**\n  - Added a guess that the security check might be less likely to trigger if the request is made from a residential IP address rather than a data center IP address.
