{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a contributor to a version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The version of OpenCV that added support for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributors to that specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Specific details on the contribution made by the relevant contributor to OpenCV.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Matching the names of contributors to the specific version of OpenCV with the names of former Chinese heads of government, based on their Latin alphabet transliterations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor's name could be Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, or Li Peng, among others.\n   - The version of OpenCV that added support for Mask-RCNN is likely a recent one, possibly around 2018-2020, given the timeline of Mask-RCNN's development and adoption.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Version of OpenCV with Mask-RCNN Support**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for the version of OpenCV that added support for Mask-RCNN.\n  - Note the specific version number and release date.\n\n- **List Contributors to the Identified Version of OpenCV**\n  - Use WebSurfer to find the release notes or changelog for the identified version of OpenCV.\n  - Extract the list of contributors from the release notes or changelog.\n\n- **Transliterate Names of Former Chinese Heads of Government**\n  - Use WebSurfer to compile a list of former Chinese heads of government.\n  - Transliterate their names into the Latin alphabet.\n\n- **Match Contributor Names with Former Chinese Heads of Government**\n  - Compare the list of contributors with the list of transliterated names of former Chinese heads of government.\n  - Identify any matches.\n\n- **Verify the Contribution Details (if necessary)**\n  - If a match is found, use WebSurfer to verify the nature of the contributor's work on the Mask-RCNN support in OpenCV.\n\n- **Compile and Present the Final Answer**\n  - Summarize the findings, including the name of the matching contributor and any relevant details about their contribution."}

However, you can use OpenCV in combination with external frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to implement Mask R-CNN.

New 8-bit bilinear resize will lay stable base for complex computer vision pipelines across variety of platforms.\nOne more GSoC project has been integrated – it adds implementations of new background subtraction algorithms.\n~250 patches have been merged since OpenCV 3.3.1 and over 200 issues have been closed\nMore details about the changes and new functionality in OpenCV 3.4 can be found at \nhttps://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/ChangeLog.\nContributors\nHere is the list of contributors, based on git logs:\nopencv\nAlexander Alekhin, Dmitry Kurtaev, Maksim Shabunin, Li Peng, elenagvo, Vitaly Tuzov, Suleyman TURKMEN, catree, Tomoaki Teshima, Sayed Adel, LaurentBerger, Vladislav Sovrasov, Wu Zhiwen, Pavel Rojtberg, Rostislav Vasilikhin, Vadim Pisarevsky, tribta, Bhanudutta, Fakabbir Amin, Mattia Rizzolo, Ryan Fox, Shinya Ishikawa, berak, dtmoodie, Akhilesh Kumar, Alexander Nesterov, Alexander Rybnikov, Amro, Andrey Smorodov, Arthur Pastel, Cartucho, Christof Kaufmann, David Geldreich, Elena Gvozdeva, Florian Echtler, Hamdi Sahloul, Haritha, Iago Suárez, Igor Wodiany, Ivan Pozdeev, Jacob MacRitchie, James Perkins, Jcrist99, Jiri Horner, Jonathan Viney, Juha Reunanen, KUANG Fangjun, Mikhail Paulyshka, Muhammad Abdullah, Nickola, Pushkal Katara, Riyuzakii, Roman Cattaneo, Shresth Verma, Simon Guo, Wei Hao, Wu, Zhiwen, alessandro faria, gdkessler, klchang, woody.chow, wxzs5, zhijackchen, zhongwuzw\n Get started with Computer Vision with our Free OpenCV Bootcamp \nENROLL NOW\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
