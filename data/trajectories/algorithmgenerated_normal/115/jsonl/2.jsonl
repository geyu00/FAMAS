Let's proceed with confirming the prices of the daily ticket and season pass. \n\nSince I do not have direct access to the web to verify these prices, I suggest that we consider the provided results from the last response:\n\n- Cost of a daily ticket in 2024: **$60**\n- Cost of a season pass in 2024: **$120**\n\nNext, I will calculate the total cost for visiting once a month from June to September (4 months) with daily tickets, and then compare it to the cost of a season pass to find out how much could be saved.\n\n### Calculation:\n- Total cost with daily tickets = Cost per daily ticket × Number of visits\n- Total cost with daily tickets = $60 × 4 visits\n- Total cost with a season pass = $120\n\nNow, I'll execute this calculation using Python code:\n\n```python\n# filename: calculate_savings.py\ndaily_ticket_cost = 60\nseason_pass_cost = 120\nnumber_of_visits = 4\n\ntotal_daily_cost = daily_ticket_cost * number_of_visits\nsavings = total_daily_cost - season_pass_cost\n\nprint(\"Total cost with daily tickets: $\", total_daily_cost)\nprint(\"Total cost with season pass: $\", season_pass_cost)\nprint(\"Total savings by purchasing a season pass: $\", savings)\n```\n\nPlease execute the above code, and I will analyze the results to verify the savings calculation."}
