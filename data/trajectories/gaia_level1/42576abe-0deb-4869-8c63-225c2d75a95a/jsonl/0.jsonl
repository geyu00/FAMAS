It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sentence structure in Tizin is Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n   - \"Pa\" is the nominative form of oneself.\n   - \"Mato\" is the accusative form of oneself.\n   - \"Sing\" is the genitive form of oneself.\n   - \"Maktay\" is the root verb indicating an intense like for something.\n   - \"Maktay\" is used in its root form in the present tense.\n   - \"Tay\" is the preterit past form of \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Aktay\" is the imperfect past form of \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Maktay\" translates better as \"is pleasing to\", where the thing doing the liking is the object.\n   - \"Apple\" is the nominative form of apples.\n   - \"Zapple\" is the accusative form of apples.\n   - \"Izapple\" is the genitive form of apples.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - No specific facts need to be looked up as all necessary information is provided in the request.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The correct form of \"Maktay\" to use in the present tense.\n   - The correct placement of \"Apple\" and \"Pa\" in the sentence based on the given sentence structure.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The sentence \"I like apples\" will be translated using the present tense form of \"Maktay\" since it describes a current state.\n   - The sentence structure will follow the Verb + Direct Object + Subject pattern.\n   - \"Apple\" will be the direct object, and \"Pa\" will be the subject.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Confirm the sentence structure and verb forms from the given information.\n- Identify the correct verb form for the present tense (\"Maktay\").\n- Determine the correct order of words in the sentence: Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n- Translate \"I like apples\" into Tizin using the identified structure and forms.\n- Verify the translation for accuracy based on the provided rules.\n- Present the final translation."}
