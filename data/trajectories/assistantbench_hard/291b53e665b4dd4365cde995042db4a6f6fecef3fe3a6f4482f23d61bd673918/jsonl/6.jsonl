Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The date of interest is 20/10/2020.\n   - The file type of interest is GFF3 (General Feature Format version 3).\n   - The species of interest is the beluga whale.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The specific repository or database where such GFF3 files are stored (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl, or a specialized marine biology database).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None. The information required is directly available through lookup.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file is likely to be available from a genomic database such as NCBI's GenBank or Ensembl, which are common repositories for genetic data.\n   - The file might be part of a larger dataset or project related to beluga whale genomics.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Source**: Use WebSurfer to search for the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020. Start with reputable genomic databases like NCBI, Ensembl, or specialized marine biology databases.\n- **Locate the File**: Once the correct database is identified, use WebSurfer to navigate to the specific page or section containing the GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n- **Verify the Date**: Ensure that the file is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020 by checking the metadata or release date provided on the page.\n- **Extract the Link**: If the file is available for download, use WebSurfer to extract the direct link to the GFF3 file.\n- **Report the Link**: Provide the extracted link to the GFF3 file to the user."}

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The date of interest is 20/10/2020.\n   - The file type of interest is GFF3 (General Feature Format version 3).\n   - The species of interest is the beluga whale.\n   - Ensembl and NCBI are common repositories for genetic data, but neither has a GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The specific repository or database where such GFF3 files are stored, including specialized marine biology databases or academic publications.\n   - Any recent research groups or expert contacts in the field of beluga whale genomics who might have this information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None. The information required is directly available through lookup.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file might be available from a smaller, specialized marine biology database or a recent academic publication.\n   - Research groups or experts in beluga whale genomics, such as those mentioned in recent studies or publications, might have the most recent GFF3 file.\n   - The file could be part of a specific project or study that was published around the time of interest (20/10/2020).\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- Given that Ensembl and NCBI did not have the specific file, it is reasonable to look into smaller, specialized databases or academic publications.\n- Research groups and experts in the field are often the primary sources for such detailed and specific data, especially for less commonly studied species like beluga whales.\n- Recent studies or publications around the date of interest might mention or provide links to the GFF3 file, as they often include supplementary data files.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Limited Scope of Initial Searches**: The initial searches were primarily focused on well-known genomic databases (Ensembl and NCBI), which did not yield the desired GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020.\n2. **Inadequate Exploration of Specialized Resources**: There was insufficient exploration of specialized marine biology databases, academic publications, and research groups that might have the specific file.\n3. **Lack of Direct Contact with Experts**: No attempts were made to reach out to experts or research groups directly, which could have provided more targeted and accurate information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Expand Search to Specialized Databases and Academic Publications**\n  - Perform a detailed search on specialized marine biology databases and academic publications.\n  - Use keywords like \"beluga whale genomics,\" \"GFF3 file 2020,\" \"marine mammal genomics,\" and \"recent studies on beluga whale genetics.\"\n\n- **Identify and Contact Research Groups and Experts**\n  - Look for recent publications and studies on beluga whale genomics.\n  - Identify authors or researchers involved in these studies and attempt to contact them via email or professional networking sites.\n\n- **Check Supplementary Data of Relevant Publications**\n  - For any relevant publications found, check the supplementary data section for the GFF3 file.\n  - Download and verify the file if available.\n\n- **Utilize WebSurfer for Detailed Searches**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate through specialized databases and academic publications.\n  - Summarize the content of relevant pages and extract any links to GFF3 files.\n\n### New Plan in Bullet Points\n\n- **Step 1: Expand Search to Specialized Databases and Academic Publications**\n  - Search specialized marine biology databases (e.g., MarineGenomicsDB, OBIS-SEAMAP).\n  - Search academic publications using Google Scholar, PubMed, and other scientific databases.\n  - Use keywords: \"beluga whale genomics,\" \"GFF3 file 2020,\" \"marine mammal genomics,\" \"recent studies on beluga whale genetics.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Identify and Contact Research Groups and Experts**\n  - Find recent publications on beluga whale genomics.\n  - Identify authors or researchers involved in these studies.\n  - Use WebSurfer to find contact information (email, professional networking profiles).\n  - Draft and send a brief, polite email requesting the GFF3 file.\n\n- **Step 3: Check Supplementary Data of Relevant Publications**\n  - For each relevant publication, check the supplementary data section.\n  - Use WebSurfer to download and verify the GFF3 file if available.\n\n- **Step 4: Utilize WebSurfer for Detailed Searches**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate through specialized databases and academic publications.\n  - Summarize the content of relevant pages and extract any links to GFF3 files.\n  - Ensure the file is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\nBy following this new plan, we aim to avoid the previous limitations and increase the chances of finding the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020."}

{"agent": "WebSurfer", "content": "The article \"The Genome of the Beluga Whale (Delphinapterus leucas)\" presents a detailed genomic analysis of the beluga whale, a cetacean species that inhabits arctic and subarctic regions. The researchers used advanced DNA sequencing techniques, including microfluidic partitioning and non-partitioned library construction, to assemble a highly contiguous genome with a scaffold N50 length of over 19 Mbp and a total reconstruction of 2.32 Gbp. Transcriptome data from various tissues (brain, duodenum, heart, lung, spleen, and liver) were also generated to enhance the understanding of functional elements. The final assembly was compared to the killer whale genome, showing a high degree of similarity. The study provides valuable resources for comparative genomics and marine mammal research, and the assembled sequence and data are available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)."}
