{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nOn Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The request is about the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n   - The focus is on the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n   - The question pertains to the last amendment to the first rule in an article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically on the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n   - The article within this section that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles.\n   - The first rule in this article.\n   - The last amendment to this first rule as of 2021.\n   - The specific word that was deleted in this last amendment.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Determining which article has \"witnesses\" in the most titles based on the information available on the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically might be \"Federal Rules of Evidence\" (FRE), but this needs verification.\n   - The word deleted in the last amendment could be a common legal term, such as \"material,\" \"relevant,\" or \"competent,\" but this is speculative and requires checking the actual text of the amendment.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Fifth Section of Federal Rules Alphabetically**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n  - Locate the alphabetical list of federal rules and identify the fifth section.\n\n- **Find the Article with \"Witnesses\" in the Most Titles**\n  - Use WebSurfer to browse through the identified section and find the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles.\n  - Note the name and location of this article.\n\n- **Locate the First Rule in the Identified Article**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the first rule in the identified article.\n\n- **Determine the Last Amendment to the First Rule as of 2021**\n  - Use WebSurfer to check the amendment history of the first rule.\n  - Identify the last amendment made as of 2021.\n\n- **Identify the Word Deleted in the Last Amendment**\n  - Use WebSurfer to review the details of the last amendment.\n  - Note the specific word that was deleted.\n\n- **Summarize and Report the Findings**\n  - Compile the information gathered and provide a clear and concise answer to the original request."}

A Witness’s Character for Truthfulness or Untruthfulness \n Rule 608. A Witness’s Character for Truthfulness or Untruthfulness \n (a)  Reputation or Opinion Evidence.  A witness’s credibility may be attacked or supported by testimony about the witness’s reputation for having a character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or by testimony in the form of an opinion about that character. But evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the witness’s character for truthfulness has been attacked. \n (b) Specific Instances of Conduct.  Except for a criminal conviction under Rule 609, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove specific instances of a witness’s conduct in order to attack or support the witness’s character for truthfulness. But the court may, on cross-examination, allow them to be inquired into if they are probative of the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of: \n (1)  the witness; or \n (2)  another witness whose character the witness being cross-examined has testified about. \n By testifying on another matter, a witness does not waive any privilege against self-incrimination for testimony that relates only to the witness’s character for truthfulness. \n Notes \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1935; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 25, 1988, eff. Nov. 1, 1988; Mar. 27, 2003, eff. Dec. 1, 2003; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n Subdivision (a)  . In Rule 404(a) the general position is taken that character evidence is not admissible for the purpose of proving that the person acted in conformity therewith, subject, however, to several exceptions, one of which is character evidence of a witness as bearing upon his credibility. The present rule develops that exception. \n In accordance with the bulk of judicial authority, the inquiry is strictly limited to character for veracity, rather than allowing evidence as to character generally. The result is to sharpen relevancy, to reduce surprise, waste of time, and confusion, and to make the lot of the witness somewhat less unattractive.
