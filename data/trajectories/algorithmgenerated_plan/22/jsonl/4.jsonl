However, the script is currently returning an error. We need to debug the script and correct it.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Review the provided Python script to identify any syntax or logical errors.\n2. Correct the identified errors in the script.\n3. Test the corrected script with a sample input to ensure it works as expected.\n\n## Output format\n- The corrected Python script\n- The output of the script when tested with a sample input\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The script should correctly process the list of numbers and return the sum of the squares of the even numbers.\n- The script should handle edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with no even numbers.\n\n## Provided Python script\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\nresult = sum_of_squares_even(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```"}

The logic of summing the squares of even numbers is also appropriately implemented.\n\n### Plan Execution\nI'll provide a corrected version of the script and include an additional test to check for edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with no even numbers.\n\nHere's the modified Python script, followed by an execution of the tests with sample inputs:\n\n1. The original functionality of processing the list of numbers.\n2. An edge case: an empty list.\n3. An edge case: a list with no even numbers.\n\n```python\n# filename: sum_of_squares_even.py\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    if not numbers:  # Check for empty list\n        return 0\n    \n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n            \n    return sum_squares\n\n# Testing the function with different inputs\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nresult1 = sum_of_squares_even(numbers)\n\nempty_list = []\nresult2 = sum_of_squares_even(empty_list)\n\nno_even_numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7]\nresult3 = sum_of_squares_even(no_even_numbers)\n\nprint(result1)  # Expected output: 220 (2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 8^2 + 10^2)\nprint(result2)  # Expected output: 0\nprint(result3)  # Expected output: 0\n```\n\nNow, I'll have the Computer_terminal execute this script."}

For the empty list `[]`, the output is **0**, indicating that there are no numbers to sum.\n3. For the list `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, the output is also **0**, confirming that there are no even numbers to sum.\n\nThe task has been completed as per the specifications. \n\nTERMINATE"}
