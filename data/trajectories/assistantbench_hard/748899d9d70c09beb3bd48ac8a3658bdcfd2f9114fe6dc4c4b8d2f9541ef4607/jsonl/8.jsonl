{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nHow much does it cost to send an envelope with 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with DHL, USPS, or Fedex? (Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sender is located in Rio de Janeiro.\n   - The recipient is located in New York City (NYC).\n   - The desired delivery time is 1 week.\n   - The item to be sent is an envelope.\n   - The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n   - Specific details about the 1-week delivery service for each carrier (if available).\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n   - Weight and size limits for envelopes for each carrier.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping option, including any additional fees or taxes.\n   - Whether the 1-week delivery time can be guaranteed by each carrier for the given route.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - DHL, USPS, and FedEx likely have different pricing structures for international shipping.\n   - Additional fees such as customs duties and handling charges may apply, especially for international shipments.\n   - The cost for DHL might be higher due to its reputation for reliable international shipping.\n   - USPS might offer a more affordable option but may not guarantee the 1-week delivery time.\n   - FedEx could offer a balance between cost and speed, possibly with a slightly higher price than USPS but lower than DHL.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the required information**: Shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery time.\n- **Assign tasks to team members**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform web searches to find the current shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for the specified route and delivery time.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check for any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Verify if the 1-week delivery time can be guaranteed by each carrier.\n- **Compile the data**:\n  - **Assistant**: Collect the information provided by WebSurfer and organize it into a structured format.\n- **Format the final output**:\n  - **Assistant**: Create a JSON list with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n- **Review and finalize**:\n  - **Assistant**: Review the compiled data for accuracy and completeness.\n  - **Assistant**: Provide the final JSON output."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nHow much does it cost to send an envelope with 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with DHL, USPS, or Fedex? (Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress and challenges we've encountered:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sender is located in Rio de Janeiro.\n   - The recipient is located in New York City (NYC).\n   - The desired delivery time is 1 week.\n   - The item to be sent is an envelope.\n   - The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - The official rate calculators for USPS and DHL are currently not accessible.\n   - The FedEx website encountered an issue and did not provide the required information.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n   - Specific details about the 1-week delivery service for each carrier (if available).\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n   - Weight and size limits for envelopes for each carrier.\n   - Alternative sources for finding shipping rates and fees for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping option, including any additional fees or taxes.\n   - Whether the 1-week delivery time can be guaranteed by each carrier for the given route.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - DHL, USPS, and FedEx likely have different pricing structures for international shipping.\n   - Additional fees such as customs duties and handling charges may apply, especially for international shipments.\n   - The cost for DHL might be higher due to its reputation for reliable international shipping.\n   - USPS might offer a more affordable option but may not guarantee the 1-week delivery time.\n   - FedEx could offer a balance between cost and speed, possibly with a slightly higher price than USPS but lower than DHL.\n   - Third-party shipping calculators or detailed shipping guides might provide the necessary information when official rate calculators are not accessible.\n   - The issues with accessing the official rate calculators might be temporary and can be resolved by trying again later or using different devices or networks.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- Given the issues with accessing the official rate calculators, it is reasonable to assume that third-party shipping calculators or detailed shipping guides might provide the necessary information. These resources often aggregate data from multiple carriers and can offer a comprehensive view of shipping costs and options.\n- The issues with the FedEx website and USPS rate calculator suggest that there might be temporary technical problems. Retrying the search at a different time or using a different device or network could resolve these issues.\n- The educated guesses about the relative costs of DHL, USPS, and FedEx remain valid based on general industry knowledge and past experiences with these carriers.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Accessibility Issues with Official Websites**:\n   - The USPS and DHL rate calculators were not accessible, leading to dead ends in the search for accurate shipping rates.\n   - The FedEx website encountered a system error, preventing us from obtaining the necessary information.\n\n2. **Limited Search Scope**:\n   - The initial search queries were too specific and did not yield useful results, especially when the official calculators were down.\n\n3. **Technical Limitations**:\n   - The web surfer encountered HTTP errors and protocol issues, which prevented it from accessing certain pages.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Third-Party Shipping Calculators**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to third-party shipping calculators like [Onlineshippingcalculator.com](https://onlineshippingcalculator.com) to find the shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery time.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure to fill in all required details such as origin, destination, weight, and dimensions of the envelope.\n\n2. **Check Detailed Shipping Guides**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for detailed shipping guides or rate charts for DHL, USPS, and FedEx. Look for PDFs or web pages that provide comprehensive information on international shipping rates and services.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use search terms like \"DHL international shipping guide,\" \"USPS international shipping rates,\" and \"FedEx international shipping rates.\"\n\n3. **Retry Official Rate Calculators at Different Times**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Try accessing the official rate calculators for USPS, DHL, and FedEx at different times of the day to see if the issues are temporary.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use different devices or networks if possible to rule out local connectivity issues.\n\n4. **Summarize and Verify Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the rates are found, summarize the information and verify if the 1-week delivery time can be guaranteed by each carrier.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check for any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n\n5. **Compile and Format the Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Collect the information provided by WebSurfer and organize it into a structured format.\n   - **Assistant**: Create a JSON list with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n\n6. **Review and Finalize**:\n   - **Assistant**: Review the compiled data for accuracy and completeness.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final JSON output.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Third-Party Shipping Calculators**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to [Onlineshippingcalculator.com](https://onlineshippingcalculator.com) and input the details for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery time.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n\n2. **Search for Detailed Shipping Guides**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"DHL international shipping guide,\" \"USPS international shipping rates,\" and \"FedEx international shipping rates.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Download or access any relevant PDFs or web pages and extract the necessary information.\n\n3. **Retry Official Rate Calculators**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Try accessing the official rate calculators for USPS, DHL, and FedEx at different times.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use search terms like \"USPS calculate postage price,\" \"DHL get a quote,\" and \"FedEx calculate shipping rates.\"\n\n4. **Summarize and Verify Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the shipping rates and verify the 1-week delivery time and any additional fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure all information is accurate and complete.\n\n5. **Compile and Format the Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Organize the information into a JSON list with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd).\"\n   - **Assistant**: Format the JSON output as required.\n\n6. **Review and Finalize**:\n   - **Assistant**: Review the compiled data for accuracy and completeness.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final JSON output.\n\nBy following this new plan, we aim to overcome the previous challenges and successfully obtain the required shipping rates and details."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nHow much does it cost to send an envelope with 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with DHL, USPS, or Fedex? (Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress and challenges we've encountered:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sender is located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n   - The recipient is located in New York City (NYC), USA.\n   - The desired delivery time is 1 week.\n   - The item to be sent is an envelope.\n   - The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - The official rate calculators for USPS and DHL are currently not accessible.\n   - The FedEx website encountered an issue and did not provide the required information.\n   - The third-party shipping calculator [Onlineshippingcalculator.com](https://onlineshippingcalculator.com) is accessible and can be used to estimate shipping rates.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n   - Specific details about the 1-week delivery service for each carrier (if available).\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n   - Weight and size limits for envelopes for each carrier.\n   - Alternative sources for finding shipping rates and fees for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping option, including any additional fees or taxes.\n   - Whether the 1-week delivery time can be guaranteed by each carrier for the given route.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - DHL, USPS, and FedEx likely have different pricing structures for international shipping.\n   - Additional fees such as customs duties and handling charges may apply, especially for international shipments.\n   - The cost for DHL might be higher due to its reputation for reliable international shipping.\n   - USPS might offer a more affordable option but may not guarantee the 1-week delivery time.\n   - FedEx could offer a balance between cost and speed, possibly with a slightly higher price than USPS but lower than DHL.\n   - Third-party shipping calculators or detailed shipping guides might provide the necessary information when official rate calculators are not accessible.\n   - The issues with accessing the official rate calculators might be temporary and can be resolved by trying again later or using different devices or networks.\n   - Using the third-party shipping calculator [Onlineshippingcalculator.com](https://onlineshippingcalculator.com) should provide a reliable estimate of the shipping costs and options.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- Given the successful access to [Onlineshippingcalculator.com](https://onlineshippingcalculator.com), it is reasonable to assume that this tool will provide accurate and useful estimates for the shipping rates.\n- The issues with the official rate calculators suggest that they might be experiencing temporary technical problems. Retrying the search at a different time or using a different device or network could still be beneficial.\n- The educated guesses about the relative costs of DHL, USPS, and FedEx remain valid based on general industry knowledge and past experiences with these carriers.\n- Using a third-party calculator can help bypass the technical issues with the official calculators and provide a comprehensive view of the shipping options and costs.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Third-Party Shipping Calculators**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to [Onlineshippingcalculator.com](https://onlineshippingcalculator.com) and input the details for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery time.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure to fill in all required details such as origin, destination, weight, and dimensions of the envelope.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Get rates' and extract the shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n\n2. **Check Detailed Shipping Guides**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for detailed shipping guides or rate charts for DHL, USPS, and FedEx. Look for PDFs or web pages that provide comprehensive information on international shipping rates and services.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use search terms like \"DHL international shipping guide,\" \"USPS international shipping rates,\" and \"FedEx international shipping rates.\"\n\n3. **Retry Official Rate Calculators at Different Times**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Try accessing the official rate calculators for USPS, DHL, and FedEx at different times of the day to see if the issues are temporary.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use different devices or networks if possible to rule out local connectivity issues.\n\n4. **Summarize and Verify Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the rates are found, summarize the information and verify if the 1-week delivery time can be guaranteed by each carrier.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check for any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n\n5. **Compile and Format the Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Collect the information provided by WebSurfer and organize it into a structured format.\n   - **Assistant**: Create a JSON list with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n\n6. **Review and Finalize**:\n   - **Assistant**: Review the compiled data for accuracy and completeness.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final JSON output.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Third-Party Shipping Calculators**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to [Onlineshippingcalculator.com](https://onlineshippingcalculator.com) and input the following details:\n     - From city: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n     - To city: New York City, USA\n     - Package type: Envelope\n     - Weight: 100g\n     - Dimensions: 10cm x 15cm\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Get rates' and extract the shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n\n2. **Search for Detailed Shipping Guides**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"DHL international shipping guide,\" \"USPS international shipping rates,\" and \"FedEx international shipping rates.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Download or access any relevant PDFs or web pages and extract the necessary information.\n\n3. **Retry Official Rate Calculators**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Try accessing the official rate calculators for USPS, DHL, and FedEx at different times.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use search terms like \"USPS calculate postage price,\" \"DHL get a quote,\" and \"FedEx calculate shipping rates.\"\n\n4. **Summarize and Verify Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the shipping rates and verify the 1-week delivery time and any additional fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure all information is accurate and complete.\n\n5. **Compile and Format the Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Organize the information into a JSON list with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd).\"\n   - **Assistant**: Format the JSON output as required.\n\n6. **Review and Finalize**:\n   - **Assistant**: Review the compiled data for accuracy and completeness.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final JSON output.\n\nPlease proceed with the first step by navigating to [Onlineshippingcalculator.com](https://onlineshippingcalculator.com) and inputting the specified details.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Repetition of Input Errors**:\n   - There was a repeated mistake where the \"To city\" field was being filled with \"New York City, USA\" instead of the \"From city\" field being filled with \"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\" This led to incorrect inputs and failed attempts to get the shipping rates.\n\n2. **Lack of Clear Instructions**:\n   - The instructions provided to WebSurfer were not specific enough to ensure that the correct fields were being filled in the correct order. This resulted in repeated incorrect entries and delays.\n\n3. **Inadequate Verification**:\n   - There was no verification step to ensure that the inputs were correct before submitting the form. This could have caught the errors early and avoided repeated mistakes.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Clear and Specific Instructions**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to [Onlineshippingcalculator.com](https://onlineshippingcalculator.com).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill in the \"From city\" field with \"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill in the \"To city\" field with \"New York City, USA.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Select \"Envelope\" as the package type.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter the weight as 100g.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter the dimensions as 10cm x 15cm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Get rates.'\n\n2. **Verification Step**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Before clicking 'Get rates,' verify that all fields are correctly filled in.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Take a screenshot of the form to confirm the inputs.\n\n3. **Extract and Summarize Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: After clicking 'Get rates,' extract the shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note any additional fees or taxes mentioned.\n\n4. **Retry Official Rate Calculators**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Try accessing the official rate calculators for USPS, DHL, and FedEx at different times of the day.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use different devices or networks if possible to rule out local connectivity issues.\n\n5. **Compile and Format the Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Collect the information provided by WebSurfer and organize it into a structured format.\n   - **Assistant**: Create a JSON list with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n\n6. **Review and Finalize**:\n   - **Assistant**: Review the compiled data for accuracy and completeness.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final JSON output.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Third-Party Shipping Calculators**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to [Onlineshippingcalculator.com](https://onlineshippingcalculator.com).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill in the \"From city\" field with \"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill in the \"To city\" field with \"New York City, USA.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Select \"Envelope\" as the package type.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter the weight as 100g.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter the dimensions as 10cm x 15cm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify all fields are correct and take a screenshot.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Get rates.'\n\n2. **Extract and Summarize Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note any additional fees or taxes mentioned.\n\n3. **Retry Official Rate Calculators**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Try accessing the official rate calculators for USPS, DHL, and FedEx at different times.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use different devices or networks if possible.\n\n4. **Compile and Format the Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Organize the information into a JSON list with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd).\"\n   - **Assistant**: Format the JSON output as required.\n\n5. **Review and Finalize**:\n   - **Assistant**: Review the compiled data for accuracy and completeness.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final JSON output.\n\nPlease proceed with the first step by navigating to [Onlineshippingcalculator.com](https://onlineshippingcalculator.com) and filling in the specified details."}

Look for PDFs or web pages that provide comprehensive information on international shipping rates and services.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use search terms like \"DHL international shipping guide,\" \"USPS international shipping rates,\" and \"FedEx international shipping rates.\"\n\n3. **Retry Official Rate Calculators at Different Times**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Try accessing the official rate calculators for USPS, DHL, and FedEx at different times of the day to see if the issues are temporary.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use different devices or networks if possible to rule out local connectivity issues.\n\n4. **Summarize and Verify Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the rates are found, summarize the information and verify if the 1-week delivery time can be guaranteed by each carrier.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check for any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n\n5. **Compile and Format the Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Collect the information provided by WebSurfer and organize it into a structured format.\n   - **Assistant**: Create a JSON list with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n\n6. **Review and Finalize**:\n   - **Assistant**: Review the compiled data for accuracy and completeness.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final JSON output.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Third-Party Shipping Calculators**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to [Onlineshippingcalculator.com](https://onlineshippingcalculator.com).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill in the \"From city\" field with \"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill in the \"To city\" field with \"New York City, USA.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Select \"Envelope\" as the package type.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter the weight as 100g.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter the dimensions as 10cm x 15cm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify all fields are correct and take a screenshot.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click 'Get rates.'\n\n2. **Extract and Summarize Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note any additional fees or taxes mentioned.\n\n3. **Retry Official Rate Calculators**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Try accessing the official rate calculators for USPS, DHL, and FedEx at different times.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use different devices or networks if possible.\n\n4. **Compile and Format the Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Organize the information into a JSON list with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd).\"\n   - **Assistant**: Format the JSON output as required.\n\n5. **Review and Finalize**:\n   - **Assistant**: Review the compiled data for accuracy and completeness.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final JSON output.\n\n### Execution\n\nPlease proceed with the first step by navigating to [Onlineshippingcalculator.com](https://onlineshippingcalculator.com) and inputting the specified details:\n\n1. **From city**: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n2. **To city**: New York City, USA\n3. **Package type**: Envelope\n4. **Weight**: 100g\n5. **Dimensions**: 10cm x 15cm\n\nVerify all fields are correct, take a screenshot, and click 'Get rates'.

This method should be prioritized to ensure we get the necessary information.\n- **Detailed Shipping Guides**: Even if the rate calculators are not accessible, detailed shipping guides and rate charts can provide valuable information. These resources are often comprehensive and can be used to cross-verify the rates obtained from the third-party calculator.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Field Filling**:\n   - The 'From city' and 'To city' fields were repeatedly filled incorrectly.
