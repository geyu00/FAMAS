{"agent": "DataCollection_Expert", "content": "I will start by verifying the hikes that were listed in the previous response. I will check each hike against the criteria set forth in the task description: they need to be recommended by at least three different people with kids and must have an average rating of at least 4.5/5 from at least 50 reviews on TripAdvisor.\n\nLet's cross-reference these hikes with TripAdvisor to collect the necessary data.\n\nHere is the list of hikes to check:\n1. Mammoth Terraces\n2. Pelican Creek Nature Trail\n3. Trout Lake\n4. Old Faithful Area Trails (e.g., Geyser Hill and Observation Point Loop)\n5. Elephant Back Trail\n6. Fountain Paint Pots\n7. Mount Washburn\n8. West Thumb Geyser Basin\n\nI will now gather the ratings and reviews data for these hikes.
