Since then, the genome has been updated multiple times to refine accuracy and include additional breeds and genetic information. By May 2020, the most relevant version was CanFam3.1 along with various datasets regarding gene annotations, breed variations, and genomic studies.\n\nNow, I will proceed to find the relevant genomic data files that were accessible in May 2020. I will look for databases like Ensembl, NCBI, or UCSC Genome Browser for the required files.\n\nI'll start by searching for the specific URLs that contained this data during the mentioned time frame. \n\nI'll execute a query in the relevant databases to find the information needed. Please hold on while I do that. \n\n```python\n# Searching for genomic data files related to dog genome CanFam3.1 as of May 2020\nimport requests\n\n# URLs of the common genomic databases\ngenomic_databases = [\n    \"https://www.ensembl.org/Dog/Info/Index\",\n    \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000002285.2/\",\n    \"http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=canFam3\"\n]\n\n# Function to check the accessibility of the URLs\ndef check_urls(urls):\n    accessible_urls = []\n    for url in urls:\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(url)\n            if response.status_code == 200:\n                accessible_urls.append(url)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error accessing {url}: {e}\")\n    return accessible_urls\n\n# Check the links for accessibility\naccessible_links = check_urls(genomic_databases)\nprint(accessible_links)\n``` \n\nLet's run this code to find out which links are currently accessible."}
