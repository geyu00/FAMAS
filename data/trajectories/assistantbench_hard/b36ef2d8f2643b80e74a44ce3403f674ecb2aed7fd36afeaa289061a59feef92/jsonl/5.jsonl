Please navigate to the class schedule section of the Blink Fitness East Village page to check for classes before 7 AM.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues**: The previous attempts to scroll down the page did not successfully reach the class schedule section, possibly due to the page layout or the need for specific navigation actions.\n2. **Lack of Specific Navigation Instructions**: The instructions provided were too general and did not guide the WebSurfer to the exact section needed.\n3. **Class Schedule Location**: The class schedule might be located in a less obvious part of the website, such as a separate tab or a hidden section that requires clicking a specific button.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Class Schedule Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Blink Fitness East Village page again.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on any tabs or buttons that might lead to the class schedule, such as \"Classes,\" \"Schedule,\" or \"Group Fitness.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the class schedule is not immediately visible, try scrolling down the page in smaller increments and look for headings or sections related to class schedules.\n\n2. **Check for Early Morning Classes**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the class schedule is found, identify classes offered before 7 AM.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Take a screenshot or note the relevant class times and names.\n\n3. **Verify and Compile Results**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the collected information to ensure it meets the criteria (classes before 7 AM).\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of gyms and their early morning classes into a clear and concise format.\n\n4. **Present the Final List**\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final list of gyms and their early morning classes to the user.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Visit the Blink Fitness East Village Page**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Blink Fitness East Village page at https://locations.blinkfitness.com/ny/new-york/98-avenue-a.\n\n- **Step 2: Locate the Class Schedule**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for and click on any tabs or buttons labeled \"Classes,\" \"Schedule,\" \"Group Fitness,\" or similar.\n  - **WebSurfer**: If no such tabs are found, scroll down the page in smaller increments (e.g., one page at a time) and look for headings or sections related to class schedules.\n\n- **Step 3: Identify Early Morning Classes**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Once the class schedule is found, identify classes offered before 7 AM.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Take a screenshot or note the relevant class times and names.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify and Compile Results**\n  - **Assistant**: Review the collected information to ensure it meets the criteria (classes before 7 AM).\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the list of gyms and their early morning classes into a clear and concise format.\n\n- **Step 5: Present the Final List**\n  - **Assistant**: Present the final list of gyms and their early morning classes to the user.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich gyms near Tompkins Square Park (<200m) have fitness classes before 7am?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and observations:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Tompkins Square Park.\n   - The distance criterion for gyms is within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park.\n   - The time criterion for fitness classes is before 7 AM.\n   - Blink Fitness at 98 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009 is located within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park.\n   - The Blink Fitness East Village location is open 24 hours on certain days.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific gyms located within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park.\n   - Class schedules for these gyms, specifically those offered before 7 AM.\n   - These facts can be found on gym websites, local business directories, Google Maps, or fitness apps like ClassPass.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether the gyms identified within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park offer fitness classes before 7 AM based on their class schedules.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that at least one gym within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park offers early morning classes, as many urban gyms cater to early risers and professionals who prefer to work out before the workday begins.\n   - Gyms near parks are often popular and may have a variety of class times to accommodate different schedules.\n   - Blink Fitness, being a well-known chain, is likely to have a detailed class schedule available on its website, which should include early morning classes.\n   - Given the 24-hour operation of Blink Fitness East Village, it is highly probable that they offer classes before 7 AM to cater to early risers.\n\n5. **NEW OBSERVATIONS**\n   - The Blink Fitness East Village website does not immediately display the class schedule, which may require additional navigation or a separate link.\n   - The main menu and footer of the Blink Fitness East Village page do not have an obvious link to the class schedule.\n   - The website's structure and layout may require more specific navigation actions to locate the class schedule.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The 24-hour operation of Blink Fitness East Village strongly suggests that they cater to a wide range of schedules, including early morning workouts.\n- Well-known gym chains like Blink Fitness typically provide comprehensive class schedules, which are often accessible through their website or a dedicated app.\n- The lack of an immediately visible class schedule on the main page indicates that it may be located in a less obvious section, such as a separate tab or a hidden link.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Class Schedule Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Blink Fitness East Village page at https://locations.blinkfitness.com/ny/new-york/98-avenue-a.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for and click on any tabs or buttons labeled 'Classes,' 'Schedule,' 'Group Fitness,' or similar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If no such tabs are found, scroll down the page in smaller increments and look for headings or sections related to class schedules.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check the footer and any dropdown menus for links to the class schedule.\n\n2. **Check for Early Morning Classes**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the class schedule is found, identify classes offered before 7 AM.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Take a screenshot or note the relevant class times and names.\n\n3. **Verify and Compile Results**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the collected information to ensure it meets the criteria (classes before 7 AM).\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of gyms and their early morning classes into a clear and concise format.\n\n4. **Present the Final List**\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final list of gyms and their early morning classes to the user.\n\nPlease proceed with the next steps to find the class schedule for Blink Fitness East Village.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues**: The class schedule section was not easily accessible from the main page of the Blink Fitness East Village location. The web surfer did not find the class schedule despite multiple attempts to scroll and click on various elements.\n2. **Lack of Specific Navigation Instructions**: The instructions provided were too general and did not guide the web surfer to the exact section needed.\n3. **Hidden or Less Obvious Links**: The class schedule might be located in a less obvious part of the website, such as a separate tab or a hidden section that requires specific navigation actions.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Visit the Blink Fitness East Village Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Blink Fitness East Village page at https://locations.blinkfitness.com/ny/new-york/98-avenue-a.\n\n2. **Check the Main Menu and Footer**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for any links or buttons labeled 'Classes,' 'Schedule,' 'Group Fitness,' or similar in the main menu and footer.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If no such links are found, scroll down the page in smaller increments and look for headings or sections related to class schedules.\n\n3. **Use Search Functionality**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search functionality on the page (if available) to search for keywords like \"class schedule\" or \"group fitness.\"\n\n4. **Explore Related Pages**\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the class schedule is not found on the main page, navigate to related pages such as 'About Us,' 'Services,' or 'Membership' to see if the class schedule is linked from there.\n\n5. **Check for Pop-up or Modal Windows**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Sometimes class schedules are displayed in pop-up or modal windows. Look for any buttons or links that might trigger such windows.\n\n6. **Summarize the Entire Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the entire page to ensure no important sections are missed. This can help identify any hidden or less obvious links.\n\n7. **Verify and Compile Results**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the collected information to ensure it meets the criteria (classes before 7 AM).\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of gyms and their early morning classes into a clear and concise format.\n\n8. **Present the Final List**\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final list of gyms and their early morning classes to the user.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Visit the Blink Fitness East Village Page**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Blink Fitness East Village page at https://locations.blinkfitness.com/ny/new-york/98-avenue-a.\n\n- **Step 2: Check the Main Menu and Footer**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for any links or buttons labeled 'Classes,' 'Schedule,' 'Group Fitness,' or similar in the main menu and footer.\n  - **WebSurfer**: If no such links are found, scroll down the page in smaller increments and look for headings or sections related to class schedules.\n\n- **Step 3: Use Search Functionality**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Use the search functionality on the page (if available) to search for keywords like \"class schedule\" or \"group fitness.\"\n\n- **Step 4: Explore Related Pages**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to related pages such as 'About Us,' 'Services,' or 'Membership' to see if the class schedule is linked from there.\n\n- **Step 5: Check for Pop-up or Modal Windows**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for any buttons or links that might trigger pop-up or modal windows displaying the class schedule.\n\n- **Step 6: Summarize the Entire Page**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the entire page to ensure no important sections are missed.\n\n- **Step 7: Verify and Compile Results**\n  - **Assistant**: Review the collected information to ensure it meets the criteria (classes before 7 AM).\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the list of gyms and their early morning classes into a clear and concise format.\n\n- **Step 8: Present the Final List**\n  - **Assistant**: Present the final list of gyms and their early morning classes to the user.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich gyms near Tompkins Square Park (<200m) have fitness classes before 7am?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and observations:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Tompkins Square Park.\n   - The distance criterion for gyms is within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park.\n   - The time criterion for fitness classes is before 7 AM.\n   - Blink Fitness at 98 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009 is located within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park.\n   - The Blink Fitness East Village location is open 24 hours on certain days.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific gyms located within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park.\n   - Class schedules for these gyms, specifically those offered before 7 AM.\n   - These facts can be found on gym websites, local business directories, Google Maps, or fitness apps like ClassPass.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether the gyms identified within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park offer fitness classes before 7 AM based on their class schedules.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that at least one gym within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park offers early morning classes, as many urban gyms cater to early risers and professionals who prefer to work out before the workday begins.\n   - Gyms near parks are often popular and may have a variety of class times to accommodate different schedules.\n   - Blink Fitness, being a well-known chain, is likely to have a detailed class schedule available on its website, which should include early morning classes.\n   - Given the 24-hour operation of Blink Fitness East Village, it is highly probable that they offer classes before 7 AM to cater to early risers.\n   - Other nearby gyms, such as boutique fitness studios, may also offer early morning classes to attract a diverse clientele.\n\n5. **NEW OBSERVATIONS**\n   - The Blink Fitness East Village website does not immediately display the class schedule, which may require additional navigation or a separate link.\n   - The main menu and footer of the Blink Fitness East Village page do not have an obvious link to the class schedule.\n   - The website's structure and layout may require more specific navigation actions to locate the class schedule.\n   - Using the search functionality on the page with keywords like 'class schedule' or 'group fitness' did not yield any results, suggesting that the class schedule might be on a different page or accessed through a different method.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The 24-hour operation of Blink Fitness East Village strongly suggests that they cater to a wide range of schedules, including early morning workouts.\n- Well-known gym chains like Blink Fitness typically provide comprehensive class schedules, which are often accessible through their website or a dedicated app.\n- The lack of an immediately visible class schedule on the main page indicates that it may be located in a less obvious section, such as a separate tab or a hidden link.\n- Other nearby gyms, especially boutique fitness studios, are likely to offer early morning classes to attract a diverse clientele, including early risers and professionals.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Class Schedule Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Blink Fitness East Village page at https://locations.blinkfitness.com/ny/new-york/98-avenue-a.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for and click on any tabs or buttons labeled 'Classes,' 'Schedule,' 'Group Fitness,' or similar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If no such tabs are found, scroll down the page in smaller increments and look for headings or sections related to class schedules.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check the footer and any dropdown menus for links to the class schedule.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the class schedule is not found on the main page, navigate to related pages such as 'About Us,' 'Services,' or 'Membership' to see if the class schedule is linked from there.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check for any buttons or links that might trigger pop-up or modal windows displaying the class schedule.\n\n2. **Check for Early Morning Classes**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the class schedule is found, identify classes offered before 7 AM.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Take a screenshot or note the relevant class times and names.\n\n3. **Verify and Compile Results**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the collected information to ensure it meets the criteria (classes before 7 AM).\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of gyms and their early morning classes into a clear and concise format.\n\n4. **Explore Other Nearby Gyms**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for other gyms within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the websites of these gyms and look for class schedules, focusing on classes before 7 AM.\n\n5. **Present the Final List**\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final list of gyms and their early morning classes to the user.\n\nPlease proceed with the next steps to find the class schedule for Blink Fitness East Village and explore other nearby gyms.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues**: The class schedule section was not easily accessible from the main page of the Blink Fitness East Village location. The web surfer did not find the class schedule despite multiple attempts to scroll and click on various elements.\n2. **Lack of Specific Navigation Instructions**: The instructions provided were too general and did not guide the web surfer to the exact section needed.\n3. **Hidden or Less Obvious Links**: The class schedule might be located in a less obvious part of the website, such as a separate tab or a hidden section that requires specific navigation actions.\n4. **Search Functionality Limitations**: The search functionality on the page did not yield any results for keywords like 'class schedule' or 'group fitness.'\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Visit the Blink Fitness East Village Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Blink Fitness East Village page at https://locations.blinkfitness.com/ny/new-york/98-avenue-a.\n\n2. **Check the Main Menu and Footer**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for any links or buttons labeled 'Classes,' 'Schedule,' 'Group Fitness,' or similar in the main menu and footer.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If no such links are found, scroll down the page in smaller increments and look for headings or sections related to class schedules.\n\n3. **Explore Related Pages**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to related pages such as 'About Us,' 'Services,' or 'Membership' to see if the class schedule is linked from there.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check for any buttons or links that might trigger pop-up or modal windows displaying the class schedule.\n\n4. **Summarize the Entire Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the entire page to ensure no important sections are missed. This can help identify any hidden or less obvious links.\n\n5. **Use External Search Engines**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using Google or another search engine with the query \"Blink Fitness East Village class schedule.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the first few results to see if they lead to the class schedule.\n\n6. **Check Social Media and Reviews**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Blink Fitness East Village social media pages (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) and review sites (e.g., Yelp) to see if the class schedule is posted there.\n\n7. **Contact the Gym Directly**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the contact information provided on the website (phone number or email) to inquire about the class schedule.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the response and any relevant details.\n\n8. **Verify and Compile Results**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the collected information to ensure it meets the criteria (classes before 7 AM).\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of gyms and their early morning classes into a clear and concise format.\n\n9. **Present the Final List**\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final list of gyms and their early morning classes to the user.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Visit the Blink Fitness East Village Page**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Blink Fitness East Village page at https://locations.blinkfitness.com/ny/new-york/98-avenue-a.\n\n- **Step 2: Check the Main Menu and Footer**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for any links or buttons labeled 'Classes,' 'Schedule,' 'Group Fitness,' or similar in the main menu and footer.\n  - **WebSurfer**: If no such links are found, scroll down the page in smaller increments and look for headings or sections related to class schedules.\n\n- **Step 3: Explore Related Pages**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to related pages such as 'About Us,' 'Services,' or 'Membership' to see if the class schedule is linked from there.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check for any buttons or links that might trigger pop-up or modal windows displaying the class schedule.\n\n- **Step 4: Summarize the Entire Page**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the entire page to ensure no important sections are missed.\n\n- **Step 5: Use External Search Engines**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using Google or another search engine with the query \"Blink Fitness East Village class schedule.\"\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on the first few results to see if they lead to the class schedule.\n\n- **Step 6: Check Social Media and Reviews**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Blink Fitness East Village social media pages (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) and review sites (e.g., Yelp) to see if the class schedule is posted there.\n\n- **Step 7: Contact the Gym Directly**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Use the contact information provided on the website (phone number or email) to inquire about the class schedule.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Note the response and any relevant details.\n\n- **Step 8: Verify and Compile Results**\n  - **Assistant**: Review the collected information to ensure it meets the criteria (classes before 7 AM).\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the list of gyms and their early morning classes into a clear and concise format.\n\n- **Step 9: Present the Final List**\n  - **Assistant**: Present the final list of gyms and their early morning classes to the user.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich gyms near Tompkins Square Park (<200m) have fitness classes before 7am?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and observations:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Tompkins Square Park.\n   - The distance criterion for gyms is within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park.\n   - The time criterion for fitness classes is before 7 AM.\n   - Blink Fitness at 98 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009 is located within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park.\n   - The Blink Fitness East Village location is open 24 hours on certain days.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific gyms located within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park.\n   - Class schedules for these gyms, specifically those offered before 7 AM.\n   - These facts can be found on gym websites, local business directories, Google Maps, or fitness apps like ClassPass.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether the gyms identified within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park offer fitness classes before 7 AM based on their class schedules.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that at least one gym within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park offers early morning classes, as many urban gyms cater to early risers and professionals who prefer to work out before the workday begins.\n   - Gyms near parks are often popular and may have a variety of class times to accommodate different schedules.\n   - Blink Fitness, being a well-known chain, is likely to have a detailed class schedule available on its website, which should include early morning classes.\n   - Given the 24-hour operation of Blink Fitness East Village, it is highly probable that they offer classes before 7 AM to cater to early risers.\n   - Other nearby gyms, such as boutique fitness studios, may also offer early morning classes to attract a diverse clientele.\n\n5. **NEW OBSERVATIONS**\n   - The Blink Fitness East Village website does not immediately display the class schedule, which may require additional navigation or a separate link.\n   - The main menu and footer of the Blink Fitness East Village page do not have an obvious link to the class schedule.\n   - The website's structure and layout may require more specific navigation actions to locate the class schedule.\n   - Using the search functionality on the page with keywords like 'class schedule' or 'group fitness' did not yield any results, suggesting that the class schedule might be on a different page or accessed through a different method.\n   - The main Blink Fitness website (https://www.blinkfitness.com) also does not immediately provide a direct link to the class schedule for individual locations.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The 24-hour operation of Blink Fitness East Village strongly suggests that they cater to a wide range of schedules, including early morning workouts.\n- Well-known gym chains like Blink Fitness typically provide comprehensive class schedules, which are often accessible through their website or a dedicated app.\n- The lack of an immediately visible class schedule on both the location-specific and main pages indicates that it may be located in a less obvious section, such as a separate tab or a hidden link.\n- Other nearby gyms, especially boutique fitness studios, are likely to offer early morning classes to attract a diverse clientele, including early risers and professionals.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Class Schedule Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Blink Fitness East Village page at https://locations.blinkfitness.com/ny/new-york/98-avenue-a.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for and click on any tabs or buttons labeled 'Classes,' 'Schedule,' 'Group Fitness,' or similar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If no such tabs are found, scroll down the page in smaller increments and look for headings or sections related to class schedules.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check the footer and any dropdown menus for links to the class schedule.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the class schedule is not found on the main page, navigate to related pages such as 'About Us,' 'Services,' or 'Membership' to see if the class schedule is linked from there.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check for any buttons or links that might trigger pop-up or modal windows displaying the class schedule.\n\n2. **Check for Early Morning Classes**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the class schedule is found, identify classes offered before 7 AM.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Take a screenshot or note the relevant class times and names.\n\n3. **Verify and Compile Results**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the collected information to ensure it meets the criteria (classes before 7 AM).\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of gyms and their early morning classes into a clear and concise format.\n\n4. **Explore Other Nearby Gyms**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for other gyms within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the websites of these gyms and look for class schedules, focusing on classes before 7 AM.\n\n5. **Present the Final List**\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final list of gyms and their early morning classes to the user.\n\n### Additional Steps\n\n- **Use External Search Engines**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using Google or another search engine with the query \"Blink Fitness East Village class schedule.\"\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on the first few results to see if they lead to the class schedule.\n\n- **Check Social Media and Reviews**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Blink Fitness East Village social media pages (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) and review sites (e.g., Yelp) to see if the class schedule is posted there.\n\n- **Contact the Gym Directly**\n  -
