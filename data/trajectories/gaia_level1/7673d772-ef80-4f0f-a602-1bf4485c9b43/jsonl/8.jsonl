{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nOn Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request refers to the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n   - The focus is on the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n   - The task involves the last amendment to the first rule in an article with \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically on the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n   - The article within this section that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles.\n   - The text of the first rule in this article.\n   - The last amendment to this first rule, specifically noting what word was deleted.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which article has \"witnesses\" in the most titles requires counting and comparing the number of times \"witnesses\" appears in the titles of articles within the fifth section of federal rules.\n   - Identifying the specific word that was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the identified article.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically is likely to be \"Federal Rules of Evidence\" (FRE), but this needs verification.\n   - The word deleted in the last amendment could be a common term used in legal contexts, such as \"testimony,\" \"deposition,\" or \"affidavit,\" but this is speculative without looking at the actual text.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify the Fifth Section of Federal Rules Alphabetically**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Locate and identify the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n\n- **Step 2: Determine the Article with \"Witnesses\" in the Most Titles**\n  - **WebSurfer**: List all articles within the identified section.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Count the number of times \"witnesses\" appears in the titles of each article.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the article with \"witnesses\" in the most titles.\n\n- **Step 3: Find the First Rule in the Identified Article**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open the identified article.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Locate the first rule in the article.\n\n- **Step 4: Identify the Last Amendment to the First Rule**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check the history or amendments section of the first rule.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last amendment made to the first rule as of 2021.\n\n- **Step 5: Determine the Word Deleted in the Last Amendment**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Review the details of the last amendment to find the word that was deleted.\n\n- **Step 6: Compile and Present the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the word that was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the identified article."}

Who May Impeach a Witness \n Rule 607. Who May Impeach a Witness \n Any party, including the party that called the witness, may attack the witness’s credibility. \n Notes \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n The traditional rule against impeaching one's own witness is abandoned as based on false premises. A party does not hold out his witnesses as worthy of belief, since he rarely has a free choice in selecting them. Denial of the right leaves the party at the mercy of the witness and the adversary. If the impeachment is by a prior statement, it is free from hearsay dangers and is excluded from the category of hearsay under Rule 801(d)(1). Ladd, Impeachment of One's Own Witness—New Developments 4 U.Chi.L.Rev. 69 (1936); McCormick §38; 3 Wigmore §§896–918. The substantial inroads into the old rule made over the years by decisions, rules, and statutes are evidence of doubts as to its basic soundness and workability. Cases are collected in 3 Wigmore §905. Revised Rule 32(a)(1) of the \n Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  allows any party to impeach a witness by means of his deposition, and Rule 43(b) has allowed the calling and impeachment of an adverse party or person identified with him. Illustrative statutes allowing a party to impeach his own witness under varying circumstances are Ill.Rev. Stats.1967, c. 110, §60; Mass.Laws Annot. 1959, c. 233 §23; 20 N.M.Stats. Annot. 1953, §20–2–4; N.Y. CPLR §4514 (McKinney 1963); 12 Vt.Stats. Annot. 1959, §§1641a, 1642. Complete judicial rejection of the old rule is found in United States v. Freeman, \n 302 F.2d 347  (2d Cir. 1962). The same result is reached in Uniform Rule 20; California Evidence Code §785; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure §60–420. See also New Jersey Evidence Rule 20. \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment \n The amendment is technical. No substantive change is intended. \n Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment \n The language of Rule 607 has been amended as part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility. \n Federal Rules of Evidence Toolbox \nWex: \nEvidence: Overview\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@graph\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"BreadcrumbList\",\n                \"itemListElement\": [\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 1,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu\",\n                            \"name\": \"LII\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 2,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre\",\n                            \"name\": \"Federal Rules of Evidence\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 5,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_607\",\n                            \"name\": \"\\nRule 607.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nOn Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request refers to the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically is the \"Federal Rules of Evidence\" (FRE).\n   - The task involves the last amendment to the first rule in an article with \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021.\n   - Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence is titled \"Witnesses\" and contains multiple rules related to witnesses.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The first rule in Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n   - The last amendment to the first rule in Article VI as of 2021, specifically noting what word was deleted.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify the first rule in Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n   - Determine the last amendment to this first rule and the specific word that was deleted.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The first rule in Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence is likely to be Rule 601, \"Competency to Testify in General.\"\n   - The word deleted in the last amendment could be a common term used in legal contexts, such as \"testimony,\" \"deposition,\" or \"affidavit,\" but this is speculative without looking at the actual text.\n   - Given that the amendments often involve clarifications or stylistic changes, the deleted word might be a less significant term that was removed to improve clarity or consistency.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n- **Step 1: Identify the First Rule in Article VI**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Locate and identify the first rule in Article VI.\n\n- **Step 2: Find the Last Amendment to the First Rule**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check the history or amendments section of the first rule in Article VI.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last amendment made to the first rule as of 2021.\n\n- **Step 3: Determine the Word Deleted in the Last Amendment**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Review the details of the last amendment to find the word that was deleted.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile and Present the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the word that was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in Article VI.\n\nPlease proceed to navigate to Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence and identify the first rule in this article.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: The search function was used incorrectly, leading to a different page instead of staying on the specific rule page to find the amendment details.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: The search query was too broad and did not target the specific information needed, resulting in irrelevant results.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Step 1: Navigate to Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Go to the Federal Rules of Evidence page.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to Article VI (Witnesses) and click on the first rule, Rule 601.\n\n- **Step 2: Identify the Last Amendment to Rule 601**\n  - **WebSurfer**: On the Rule 601 page, scroll down to the \"Notes\" and \"Amendments\" section.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for the last amendment made as of 2021 and note the specific changes, particularly any words that were deleted.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify and Extract the Deleted Word**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Carefully read the amendment details to identify the word that was deleted.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the information is accurate and specific to the 2021 amendment.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile and Present the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the word that was deleted in the last amendment to Rule 601 in Article VI.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Navigate to Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Federal Rules of Evidence page: [Federal Rules of Evidence](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to Article VI (Witnesses) and click on Rule 601.\n\n2. **Identify the Last Amendment to Rule 601**\n   - **WebSurfer**: On the Rule 601 page, scroll down to the \"Notes\" and \"Amendments\" section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for the last amendment made as of 2021 and note the specific changes, particularly any words that were deleted.\n\n3. **Verify and Extract the Deleted Word**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Carefully read the amendment details to identify the word that was deleted.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the information is accurate and specific to the 2021 amendment.\n\n4. **Compile and Present the Final Answer**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the word that was deleted in the last amendment to Rule 601 in Article VI.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

Competency to Testify in General \n Rule 601. Competency to Testify in General \n Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise. But in a civil case, state law governs the witness’s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision. \n Notes \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds of incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are religious belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the litigation as a party or interested person or spouse of a party or interested person. With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's Acts, American jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize these grounds. \n The Dead Man's Acts are surviving traces of the common law disqualification of parties and interested persons. They exist in variety too great to convey conviction of their wisdom and effectiveness. These rules contain no provision of this kind. For the reasoning underlying the decision not to give effect to state statutes in diversity cases, see the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 501. \n No mental or moral qualifications for testifying as a witness are specified. Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore §§501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty. This result may, however, be accomplished more directly, and without haggling in terms of legal standards, by the manner of administering the oath or affirmation under Rule 603. \n Admissibility of religious belief as a ground of impeachment is treated in Rule 610. Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Federal Rules of Evidence Toolbox \nWex: \nEvidence: Overview\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@graph\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"BreadcrumbList\",\n                \"itemListElement\": [\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 1,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu\",\n                            \"name\": \"LII\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 2,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre\",\n                            \"name\": \"Federal Rules of Evidence\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 5,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_601\",\n                            \"name\": \"\\nRule 601.

Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93–650 \n Rule 601 as submitted to the Congress provided that “Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules.” One effect of the Rule as proposed would have been to abolish age, mental capacity, and other grounds recognized in some State jurisdictions as making a person incompetent as a witness. The greatest controversy centered around the Rule's rendering inapplicable in the federal courts the so-called Dead Man's Statutes which exist in some States. Acknowledging that there is substantial disagreement as to the merit of Dead Man's Statutes, the Committee nevertheless believed that where such statutes have been enacted they represent State policy which should not be overturned in the absence of a compelling federal interest. The Committee therefore amended the Rule to make competency in civil actions determinable in accordance with State law with respect to elements of claims or defenses as to which State law supplies the rule of decision. Cf. \n Courtland v. Walston & Co., Inc  ., 340 F.Supp. 1076, 1087–1092 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93–1277 \n The amendment to rule 601 parallels the treatment accorded rule 501 discussed immediately above. \n Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No. 93–1597 \n Rule 601 deals with competency of witnesses. Both the House and Senate bills provide that federal competency law applies in criminal cases. In civil actions and proceedings, the House bill provides that state competency law applies “to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision.” The Senate bill provides that “in civil actions and proceedings arising under \n 28 U.S.C. §1332  or \n 28 U.S.C. §1335  , or between citizens of different States and removed under \n 28 U.S.C. §1441(b)  the competency of a witness, person, government, State or political subdivision thereof is determined in accordance with State law, unless with respect to the particular claim or defense, Federal law supplies the rule of decision.” \n The wording of the House and Senate bills differs in the treatment of civil actions and proceedings. The rule in the House bill applies to evidence that relates to “an element of a claim or defense.” If an item of proof tends to support or defeat a claim or defense, or an element of a claim or defense, and if state law supplies the rule of decision for that claim or defense, then state competency law applies to that item of proof. \n For reasons similar to those underlying its action on Rule 501, the Conference adopts the House provision. \n Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment \n The language of Rule 601 has been amended as part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility. \nSponsored ListingsRodney Mesriani\nPREMIUM\n(866) 500-7070Santa Monica, CAEmployment Law, Personal Injury\nWebsite\nEmail\nProfile\nHaleh Shekarchian\nPREMIUM\n(800) 692-9080Beverly Hills, CAPersonal Injury, Workers' Compensation\nWebsite\nEmail\nProfile\nPaul Danziger\nPREMIUM\n(800) 864-4000Richmond, CAAsbestos & Mesothelioma\nWebsite\nEmail\nProfile\nAlan Ahdoot\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nOn Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request refers to the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically is the \"Federal Rules of Evidence\" (FRE).\n   - The task involves the last amendment to the first rule in an article with \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021.\n   - Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence is titled \"Witnesses\" and contains multiple rules related to witnesses.\n   - The first rule in Article VI is Rule 601, \"Competency to Testify in General.\"\n   - The last significant amendment to Rule 601 was in 2011 as part of a restyling effort to improve clarity and consistency.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact word that was deleted in the 2011 restyling amendment to Rule 601.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Compare the pre-amendment and post-amendment versions of Rule 601 to identify the specific word that was deleted.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The word deleted in the 2011 restyling amendment could be a minor stylistic change, such as the removal of a redundant term or a word that was deemed unnecessary for clarity.\n   - Common terms that might have been deleted include \"person,\" \"individual,\" or \"such.\"\n\n### Updated Plan:\n- **Step 1: Identify the First Rule in Article VI**\n  - **Verified**: The first rule in Article VI is Rule 601, \"Competency to Testify in General.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Find the Last Amendment to the First Rule**\n  - **Verified**: The last significant amendment to Rule 601 was in 2011 as part of a restyling effort.\n\n- **Step 3: Determine the Word Deleted in the Last Amendment**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the pre-amendment version of Rule 601.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Compare the pre-amendment and post-amendment versions of Rule 601 to identify the specific word that was deleted.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile and Present the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the word that was deleted in the last amendment to Rule 601 in Article VI.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the Pre-Amendment Version of Rule 601**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to the page with the previous versions of Rule 601.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Select the version of Rule 601 before the 2011 amendment.\n\n2. **Compare the Pre-Amendment and Post-Amendment Versions**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open both the pre-amendment and post-amendment versions of Rule 601 side by side.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the specific word that was deleted in the 2011 restyling amendment.\n\n3. **Compile and Present the Final Answer**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the word that was deleted in the last amendment to Rule 601 in Article VI.\n\nPlease proceed to navigate to the pre-amendment version of Rule 601 and compare it with the post-amendment version to identify the specific word that was deleted.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: The search for the pre-amendment version of Rule 601 did not lead to the correct page where the historical versions are available.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: The search query was too broad and did not target the specific information needed, resulting in irrelevant results.\n- **Inadequate Comparison**: The comparison between the pre-amendment and post-amendment versions was not performed effectively.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Correct Page for Historical Versions**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Go to the Federal Rules of Evidence page: [Federal Rules of Evidence](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre).\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to Article VI (Witnesses) and click on Rule 601.\n  - **WebSurfer**: On the Rule 601 page, locate and click on the link to view historical versions or amendments.\n\n- **Step 2: Identify the Pre-Amendment Version**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Find the version of Rule 601 before the 2011 amendment.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Save or note the text of the pre-amendment version.\n\n- **Step 3: Compare with the Post-Amendment Version**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Return to the current version of Rule 601.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Save or note the text of the post-amendment version.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Compare the two versions to identify the specific word that was deleted.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile and Present the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the word that was deleted in the last amendment to Rule 601 in Article VI.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page for Historical Versions**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Federal Rules of Evidence page: [Federal Rules of Evidence](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to Article VI (Witnesses) and click on Rule 601.\n   - **WebSurfer**: On the Rule 601 page, look for a link or section that provides historical versions or amendments.\n\n2. **Identify the Pre-Amendment Version**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Find the version of Rule 601 before the 2011 amendment.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Save or note the text of the pre-amendment version.\n\n3. **Compare with the Post-Amendment Version**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Return to the current version of Rule 601.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Save or note the text of the post-amendment version.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compare the two versions to identify the specific word that was deleted.\n\n4. **Compile and Present the Final Answer**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the word that was deleted in the last amendment to Rule 601 in Article VI.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

Competency to Testify in General \n Rule 601. Competency to Testify in General \n Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise. But in a civil case, state law governs the witness’s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision. \n Notes \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds of incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are religious belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the litigation as a party or interested person or spouse of a party or interested person. With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's Acts, American jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize these grounds. \n The Dead Man's Acts are surviving traces of the common law disqualification of parties and interested persons. They exist in variety too great to convey conviction of their wisdom and effectiveness. These rules contain no provision of this kind. For the reasoning underlying the decision not to give effect to state statutes in diversity cases, see the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 501. \n No mental or moral qualifications for testifying as a witness are specified. Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore §§501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty. This result may, however, be accomplished more directly, and without haggling in terms of legal standards, by the manner of administering the oath or affirmation under Rule 603. \n Admissibility of religious belief as a ground of impeachment is treated in Rule 610. Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Federal Rules of Evidence Toolbox \nWex: \nEvidence: Overview\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@graph\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"BreadcrumbList\",\n                \"itemListElement\": [\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 1,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu\",\n                            \"name\": \"LII\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 2,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre\",\n                            \"name\": \"Federal Rules of Evidence\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 5,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_601\",\n                            \"name\": \"\\nRule 601.

The greatest controversy centered around the Rule's rendering inapplicable in the federal courts the so-called Dead Man's Statutes which exist in some States. Acknowledging that there is substantial disagreement as to the merit of Dead Man's Statutes, the Committee nevertheless believed that where such statutes have been enacted they represent State policy which should not be overturned in the absence of a compelling federal interest. The Committee therefore amended the Rule to make competency in civil actions determinable in accordance with State law with respect to elements of claims or defenses as to which State law supplies the rule of decision.

Walston & Co., Inc  ., 340 F.Supp. 1076, 1087–1092 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93–1277 \n The amendment to rule 601 parallels the treatment accorded rule 501 discussed immediately above. \n Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No. 93–1597 \n Rule 601 deals with competency of witnesses. Both the House and Senate bills provide that federal competency law applies in criminal cases. In civil actions and proceedings, the House bill provides that state competency law applies “to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision.” The Senate bill provides that “in civil actions and proceedings arising under \n 28 U.S.C. §1332  or \n 28 U.S.C. §1335  , or between citizens of different States and removed under \n 28 U.S.C. §1441(b)  the competency of a witness, person, government, State or political subdivision thereof is determined in accordance with State law, unless with respect to the particular claim or defense, Federal law supplies the rule of decision.” \n The wording of the House and Senate bills differs in the treatment of civil actions and proceedings. The rule in the House bill applies to evidence that relates to “an element of a claim or defense.” If an item of proof tends to support or defeat a claim or defense, or an element of a claim or defense, and if state law supplies the rule of decision for that claim or defense, then state competency law applies to that item of proof. \n For reasons similar to those underlying its action on Rule 501, the Conference adopts the House provision. \n Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment \n The language of Rule 601 has been amended as part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.

Need for Personal Knowledge \n Rule 602. Need for Personal Knowledge \n A witness may testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may consist of the witness’s own testimony. This rule does not apply to a witness’s expert testimony under Rule 703. \n Notes \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 25, 1988, eff. Nov. 1, 1988; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n “* * * [T]he rule requiring that a witness who testifies to a fact which can be perceived by the senses must have had an opportunity to observe, and must have actually observed the fact” is a “most pervasive manifestation” of the common law insistence upon “the most reliable sources of information.” McCormick §10, p. 19. These foundation requirements may, of course, be furnished by the testimony of the witness himself; hence personal knowledge is not an absolute but may consist of what the witness thinks he knows from personal perception. 2 Wigmore §650. It will be observed that the rule is in fact a specialized application of the provisions of Rule 104(b) on conditional relevancy. \n This rule does not govern the situation of a witness who testifies to a hearsay statement as such, if he has personal knowledge of the making of the statement. Rules \n 801  and \n 805  would be applicable. This rule would, however, prevent him from testifying to the subject matter of the hearsay statement, as he has no personal knowledge of it. \n The reference to Rule 703 is designed to avoid any question of conflict between the present rule and the provisions of that rule allowing an expert to express opinions based on facts of which he does not have personal knowledge. \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment \n The amendments are technical. No substantive change is intended. \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1988 Amendment \n The amendment is technical.

Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93–650 \n Rule 601 as submitted to the Congress provided that “Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules.” One effect of the Rule as proposed would have been to abolish age, mental capacity, and other grounds recognized in some State jurisdictions as making a person incompetent as a witness. The greatest controversy centered around the Rule's rendering inapplicable in the federal courts the so-called Dead Man's Statutes which exist in some States. Acknowledging that there is substantial disagreement as to the merit of Dead Man's Statutes, the Committee nevertheless believed that where such statutes have been enacted they represent State policy which should not be overturned in the absence of a compelling federal interest. The Committee therefore amended the Rule to make competency in civil actions determinable in accordance with State law with respect to elements of claims or defenses as to which State law supplies the rule of decision. Cf. \n Courtland v. Walston & Co., Inc  ., 340 F.Supp. 1076, 1087–1092 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93–1277 \n The amendment to rule 601 parallels the treatment accorded rule 501 discussed immediately above. \n Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No. 93–1597 \n Rule 601 deals with competency of witnesses. Both the House and Senate bills provide that federal competency law applies in criminal cases. In civil actions and proceedings, the House bill provides that state competency law applies “to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision.” The Senate bill provides that “in civil actions and proceedings arising under \n 28 U.S.C. §1332  or \n 28 U.S.C. §1335  , or between citizens of different States and removed under \n 28 U.S.C. §1441(b)  the competency of a witness, person, government, State or political subdivision thereof is determined in accordance with State law, unless with respect to the particular claim or defense, Federal law supplies the rule of decision.” \n The wording of the House and Senate bills differs in the treatment of civil actions and proceedings. The rule in the House bill applies to evidence that relates to “an element of a claim or defense.” If an item of proof tends to support or defeat a claim or defense, or an element of a claim or defense, and if state law supplies the rule of decision for that claim or defense, then state competency law applies to that item of proof. \n For reasons similar to those underlying its action on Rule 501, the Conference adopts the House provision. \n Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment \n The language of Rule 601 has been amended as part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility. \nSponsored ListingsNicholas J.
