American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998).Disclaimer:\nThe Nonindigenous Occurrences section of the NAS species profiles has a new structure. The section is now dynamically updated from the NAS database to ensure that it contains the most current and accurate information. Occurrences are summarized in Table 1, alphabetically by state, with years of earliest and most recent observations, and the tally and names of drainages where the species was observed. The table contains hyperlinks to collections tables of specimens based on the states, years, and drainages selected.

The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The alligators spotted in Essex County, New Jersey, may have escaped a lagoon in Military Park, Newark (Anonymous in Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n Perhaps they had been part of a public animal display.\n The \nA. mississippiensis collected from Mesa County, Colorado, escaped from a roadside zoo (Livo et al., 1998), while the one collected from the Colorado River in California had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978).\n Conant (1977) suggested that an animal dealer intentionally established the \nA. mississippiensis population found in the Brownsville area of Cameron County, Texas.\nStatus: All the American alligators found in New York have been collected (Anderson and Habuda, 2001; Anonymous, 2001a, b; Beebe, 2001c; Heaton-Jones, 2001; Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). They are not established in this state nor could they survive the cold winters, and the story of alligators dwelling in New York City sewers is simply a well-entrenched myth (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). One of the alligators found in Union County, New Jersey, was collected; although there is no further word about the success of the 1933 great gator hunt started on the Passaic River in Essex County (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n All \nA. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).\n Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous \nA. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are \"thriving.\" There is no evidence of reproduction.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as \"not well established\" in Arizona.\nImpact of Introduction: There is no evidence that any of the nonindigenous occurrences of American alligators have had any impact on indigenous ecosystems; however, an established population of these massive carnivores in a southwestern state could negatively impact indigenous fauna. The introductions in Oklahoma, and the presumptive introduction in Cameron County, Texas, could compromise the genetic integrity of extant indigenous populations. As mentioned above, the status of indigenous alligators in Oklahoma could be obfuscated, thus creating difficulties when deciding conservation measures and future protective legislation. A large alligator is a potentially dangerous carnivore.\n While attacks on humans are exceedingly rare, they do occur on occasion (Pooley et al., 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Anonymous, 2002).\nRemarks: The taxonomy of A. mississippiensis has been reviewed or summarized by Smith and Smith (1977), King (1989), Ross and Ernst (1994), and Crother et al. (2000). Liner (1994) provides a Spanish vernacular name for the American alligator.  Brisbin et al. (1986), Gibbons and Semlitsch (1991), and Ross and Ernst (1994) provide the best literature reviews of the natural history of alligators. A variety of authors have contributed to or summarized the natural history and biology of American alligators (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973, 1976; Mount, 1975; Lang, 1987, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Vliet, 1989; and a variety of contributions compiled by Webb et al., 1987). Scientific and standard English names follow Crother (2008).Alligator mississippiensis is an aquatic, omnicarnivorous reptile capable of living in many types of waterways, both natural and man-made, and feeding upon almost any fauna it can catch (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Mount, 1975; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Some alligators dig deep holes with connecting dens than can remain filled with water during droughts, thus maintaining an aquatic environment for indigenous fauna (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Grenard, 1991).\n Courtship and mating involves complex visual and auditory displays directed at prospective mates and competitors (McIlhenny, 1935; Lang, 1987, 1989; Vliet, 1989).\n The female buries her hard-shelled eggs in a nest she constructs of dead vegetation and the surrounding muck (McIlhenny, 1935; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Females exhibit varying degrees of parental care by guarding the nest, releasing hatchlings from the nest and eggs, and transporting them to water in her mouth (Kushlan and Simon, 1981; Lang, 1987; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n Young may remain in a protective crèche with the mother and sometimes other adults for a considerable length of time, sometimes exceeding a year (Lang, 1987, 1989; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n American alligators are subject to a variety of state and federal regulations (Levell, 1997); they should not be obtained by anyone before such legislation is understood along the responsibility that goes with keeping them as captives.\nReferences \n(click for full references) Ashton, R.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress and insights gained so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking about the year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source for this information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) was once on the verge of extinction but has made a significant recovery, leading to its removal from the endangered species list in 1987 by the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n   - The American Alligator is a keystone species of the Everglades ecosystem.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - This information can be found in the USGS database or publications related to wildlife and geographic distribution of species.\n   - Detailed reports or datasets from the USGS that document the first discovery of American Alligators in states west of Texas.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific facts need to be derived from the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the historical context of the American Alligator's recovery and its primary range in the southeastern United States, it is likely that the first discovery west of Texas occurred after the species began to recover, which is post-1987.\n   - The expansion of the American Alligator's range could have been influenced by human activities such as deliberate releases or escapes from captivity, which are more common in recent decades.\n   - States west of Texas, such as New Mexico, Arizona, or California, might have recorded the first discoveries, but specific years need to be verified from the USGS data.\n   - The first discovery might be documented in state wildlife reports or local news articles, which could be cross-referenced with USGS data for accuracy.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The recovery of the American Alligator post-1987 suggests that the species had a better chance of expanding its range naturally or through human intervention in the late 20th century and early 21st century.\n- Human activities, such as pet trade and accidental releases, are more likely to have occurred in recent decades, which aligns with the timeline of the species' recovery and increased population.\n- States west of Texas, particularly those with suitable habitats, are plausible locations for the first discoveries, but specific records need to be found to confirm this.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Perform a more targeted search on the USGS website for specific reports or datasets that document the first discovery of American Alligators west of Texas.\n- Check state wildlife agency reports and local news archives for any mentions of the first sightings of American Alligators in states west of Texas.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Ineffective Search Terms**: The search terms used did not yield the specific information needed. The searches were too broad and did not target the exact data required.\n- **Lack of Targeted Navigation**: We did not navigate directly to the relevant sections of the USGS website that contain detailed records and reports.\n- **Insufficient Cross-Referencing**: We did not cross-reference the information found with other reliable sources, such as state wildlife agencies or academic publications.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Refine Search Terms**: Use more specific and targeted search terms to find the exact information.\n- **Direct Navigation**: Navigate directly to the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database and other relevant sections.\n- **Cross-Reference Information**: Cross-reference the information found with state wildlife agency reports and academic publications.\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. **Refine Search Terms**:\n   - Use more specific search terms like \"USGS first recorded American Alligator New Mexico,\" \"USGS first recorded American Alligator Arizona,\" etc.\n   - Search for \"USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database American Alligator.\"\n\n2. **Direct Navigation**:\n   - Navigate directly to the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database: [NAS Database](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/)\n   - Use the advanced query options to search for American Alligators in states west of Texas.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference Information**:\n   - Check state wildlife agency websites for reports on the first discovery of American Alligators.\n   - Search for academic publications or news articles that might have documented the first sightings.\n\n4. **Detailed Search and Extraction**:\n   - On the NAS database, use the \"Query By State\" option to search for American Alligators in states west of Texas.\n   - Extract the specific year from the records found.\n\n5. **Verify Information**:\n   - Double-check the extracted information against multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Report Findings**:\n   - Provide the year and any additional relevant details found during the search.\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the refined search terms.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Navigate directly to the USGS NAS database and use the advanced query options.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Check state wildlife agency websites for reports.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Search for academic publications or news articles.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Extract and verify the specific year from the records.\n6. **Assistant**: Compile and report the findings.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\nPlease perform a web search using the following terms:\n- \"USGS first recorded American Alligator New Mexico\"\n- \"USGS first recorded American Alligator Arizona\"\n- \"USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database American Alligator\""}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress and insights gained so far:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking about the year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source for this information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) was once on the verge of extinction but has made a significant recovery, leading to its removal from the endangered species list in 1987 by the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n   - The American Alligator is a keystone species of the Everglades ecosystem.\n   - The USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database is a central repository for spatially referenced biogeographic accounts of introduced aquatic species.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - This information can be found in the USGS NAS database or other relevant sections of the USGS website.\n   - Detailed reports or datasets from the USGS that document the first discovery of American Alligators in states west of Texas.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific facts need to be derived from the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the historical context of the American Alligator's recovery and its primary range in the southeastern United States, it is likely that the first discovery west of Texas occurred after the species began to recover, which is post-1987.\n   - The expansion of the American Alligator's range could have been influenced by human activities such as deliberate releases or escapes from captivity, which are more common in recent decades.\n   - States west of Texas, such as New Mexico, Arizona, or California, might have recorded the first discoveries, but specific years need to be verified from the USGS data.\n   - The first discovery might be documented in state wildlife reports or local news articles, which could be cross-referenced with USGS data for accuracy.\n   - The USGS NAS database is likely to have detailed records of the first occurrences of American Alligators in states west of Texas, which can provide the specific year.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The recovery of the American Alligator post-1987 suggests that the species had a better chance of expanding its range naturally or through human intervention in the late 20th century and early 21st century.\n- Human activities, such as pet trade and accidental releases, are more likely to have occurred in recent decades, which aligns with the timeline of the species' recovery and increased population.\n- States west of Texas, particularly those with suitable habitats, are plausible locations for the first discoveries, but specific records need to be found to confirm this.\n- The USGS NAS database is a comprehensive resource that tracks the occurrence of non-native species, making it the most reliable source for this information.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Perform a more targeted search on the USGS website** for specific reports or datasets that document the first discovery of American Alligators west of Texas.\n- **Check state wildlife agency reports and local news archives** for any mentions of the first sightings of American Alligators in states west of Texas.\n- **Navigate directly to the USGS NAS database** and use the 'Query By State' option to search for American Alligators in states west of Texas, such as New Mexico, Arizona, and California.\n- **Extract and verify the specific year** from the records found in the USGS NAS database.\n\n### Execution\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the USGS NAS database at https://nas.er.usgs.gov/.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Use the 'Query By State' option to search for American Alligators in states west of Texas, such as New Mexico, Arizona, and California.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Extract the specific year from the records found.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information with state wildlife agency reports and local news articles.\n5. **Assistant**: Compile and report the findings.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps:\n\nPlease navigate to the USGS NAS database at https://nas.er.usgs.gov/ and use the 'Query By State' option to search for American Alligators in states west of Texas, such as New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Extract the specific year from the records found.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Ineffective Navigation**: Despite selecting the correct group (Reptiles) and navigating to the 'Query By State' page, the specific state selections (New Mexico, Arizona, California) were not made, leading to no actual search being performed.\n- **Lack of Specific Action**: The instructions did not clearly specify the need to select the states and submit the query, which resulted in the search not being executed.\n- **Insufficient Verification**: There was no verification step to ensure that the search was actually performed and the results were extracted.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the USGS NAS Database**:\n   - Open the USGS NAS database at https://nas.er.usgs.gov/.\n\n2. **Select the Group and State**:\n   - On the 'Species Lists By State' page, select 'Reptiles' from the 'Group' dropdown menu.\n   - Select 'New Mexico' from the 'State' dropdown menu.\n   - Click the 'Submit' button to perform the search.\n\n3. **Extract the Year for New Mexico**:\n   - Scroll through the results to find the entry for the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis).\n   - Extract the specific year from the record.\n\n4. **Repeat for Arizona and California**:\n   - Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the states 'Arizona' and 'California'.\n   - Ensure to select each state individually and extract the specific year from the records.\n\n5. **Compile and Report Findings**:\n   - Compile the years found for each state.\n   - Report the earliest year among the states searched.\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the USGS NAS database at https://nas.er.usgs.gov/.\n2. **WebSurfer**: On the 'Species Lists By State' page, select 'Reptiles' from the 'Group' dropdown menu.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Select 'New Mexico' from the 'State' dropdown menu and click the 'Submit' button.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the results to find the entry for the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and extract the specific year from the record.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Repeat steps 3 and 4 for 'Arizona' and 'California'.\n6. **Assistant**: Compile the years found for each state and report the earliest year among the states searched.\n\nPlease proceed with the first step:\n\nNavigate to the USGS NAS database at https://nas.er.usgs.gov/."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Let's update the fact sheet with the current status and refine our approach:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking about the year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source for this information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) was once on the verge of extinction but has made a significant recovery, leading to its removal from the endangered species list in 1987 by the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n   - The American Alligator is a keystone species of the Everglades ecosystem.\n   - The USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database is a central repository for spatially referenced biogeographic accounts of introduced aquatic species.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - This information can be found in the USGS NAS database or other relevant sections of the USGS website.\n   - Detailed reports or datasets from the USGS that document the first discovery of American Alligators in states west of Texas.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific facts need to be derived from the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the historical context of the American Alligator's recovery and its primary range in the southeastern United States, it is likely that the first discovery west of Texas occurred after the species began to recover, which is post-1987.\n   - The expansion of the American Alligator's range could have been influenced by human activities such as deliberate releases or escapes from captivity, which are more common in recent decades.\n   - States west of Texas, such as New Mexico, Arizona, or California, might have recorded the first discoveries, but specific years need to be verified from the USGS data.\n   - The first discovery might be documented in state wildlife reports or local news articles, which could be cross-referenced with USGS data for accuracy.\n   - The USGS NAS database is likely to have detailed records of the first occurrences of American Alligators in states west of Texas, which can provide the specific year.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The recovery of the American Alligator post-1987 suggests that the species had a better chance of expanding its range naturally or through human intervention in the late 20th century and early 21st century.\n- Human activities, such as pet trade and accidental releases, are more likely to have occurred in recent decades, which aligns with the timeline of the species' recovery and increased population.\n- States west of Texas, particularly those with suitable habitats, are plausible locations for the first discoveries, but specific records need to be found to confirm this.\n- The USGS NAS database is a comprehensive resource that tracks the occurrence of non-native species, making it the most reliable source for this information.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Perform a more targeted search on the USGS website** for specific reports or datasets that document the first discovery of American Alligators west of Texas.\n- **Check state wildlife agency reports and local news archives** for any mentions of the first sightings of American Alligators in states west of Texas.\n- **Navigate directly to the USGS NAS database** and use the 'Query By State' option to search for American Alligators in states west of Texas, such as New Mexico, Arizona, and California.\n- **Extract and verify the specific year** from the records found in the USGS NAS database.\n\n### Execution\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the USGS NAS database at https://nas.er.usgs.gov/.\n2. **WebSurfer**: On the 'Species Lists By State' page, select 'Reptiles' from the 'Group' dropdown menu.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Select 'New Mexico' from the 'State' dropdown menu and click the 'Submit' button to perform the search.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the results to find the entry for the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and extract the specific year from the record.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Repeat steps 3 and 4 for 'Arizona' and 'California'.\n6. **Assistant**: Compile the years found for each state and report the earliest year among the states searched.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps:\n\nPlease navigate to the USGS NAS database at https://nas.er.usgs.gov/ and use the 'Query By State' option to search for American Alligators in states west of Texas, such as New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Extract the specific year from the records found. Start with New Mexico.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Ineffective Navigation**: Despite selecting the correct group (Reptiles) and navigating to the 'Query By State' page, the specific state selections (New Mexico, Arizona, California) were not made, leading to no actual search being performed.\n- **Lack of Specific Action**: The instructions did not clearly specify the need to select the states and submit the query, which resulted in the search not being executed.\n- **Insufficient Verification**: There was no verification step to ensure that the search was actually performed and the results were extracted.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the USGS NAS Database**\n   - Open the USGS NAS database at https://nas.er.usgs.gov/.\n\n2. **Select the Group and State**\n   - On the 'Species Lists By State' page, select 'Reptiles' from the 'Group' dropdown menu.\n   - Select 'New Mexico' from the 'State' dropdown menu.\n   - Click the 'Submit' button to perform the search.\n\n3. **Extract the Year for New Mexico**\n   - Scroll through the results to find the entry for the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis).\n   - Extract the specific year from the record.\n\n4. **Repeat for Arizona and California**\n   - Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the states 'Arizona' and 'California'.\n   - Ensure to select each state individually and extract the specific year from the records.\n\n5. **Compile and Report Findings**\n   - Compile the years found for each state.\n   - Report the earliest year among the states searched.\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the USGS NAS database at https://nas.er.usgs.gov/.\n2. **WebSurfer**: On the 'Species Lists By State' page, select 'Reptiles' from the 'Group' dropdown menu.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Select 'New Mexico' from the 'State' dropdown menu and click the 'Submit' button.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the results to find the entry for the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and extract the specific year from the record.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Repeat steps 3 and 4 for 'Arizona' and 'California'.\n6. **Assistant**: Compile the years found for each state and report the earliest year among the states searched.\n\nPlease proceed with the first step:\n\nNavigate to the USGS NAS database at https://nas.er.usgs.gov/. On the 'Species Lists By State' page, select 'Reptiles' from the 'Group' dropdown menu, then select 'New Mexico' from the 'State' dropdown menu, and click the 'Submit' button.
