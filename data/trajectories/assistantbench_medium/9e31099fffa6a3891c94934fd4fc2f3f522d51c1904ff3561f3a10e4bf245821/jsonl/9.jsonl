{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about identifying a person in the monday.com C-suite who did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The current members of the monday.com C-suite.\n   - The date of monday.com's IPO.\n   - The C-suite positions held by the current members of the monday.com C-suite at the time of the IPO.\n   - Sources for this information could include:\n     - monday.com's official website.\n     - SEC filings and press releases related to the IPO.\n     - LinkedIn profiles of the C-suite members.\n     - News articles and business reports covering the IPO and subsequent leadership changes.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the current C-suite members with their roles at the time of the IPO to identify any discrepancies.\n   - Determining the timeline of any promotions or new hires within the C-suite since the IPO.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that IPOs often involve significant changes in leadership structure, it is possible that some current C-suite members were not in their current roles or were not part of the company at all during the IPO.\n   - The CEO and CFO are likely to have been in place during the IPO, but other roles such as CMO, CTO, or CHRO might have changed hands.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use **WebSurfer** to search for the official monday.com website and navigate to the \"Leadership\" or \"About Us\" section to gather the current C-suite members' names and titles.\n- **Step 2:** Use **WebSurfer** to find the date of monday.com's IPO, which can typically be found in press releases or news articles.\n- **Step 3:** Use **WebSurfer** to search for historical information on each current C-suite member, focusing on their roles at the time of the IPO. This can be done through company press releases, news articles, and LinkedIn profiles.\n- **Step 4:** Cross-reference the current C-suite members' roles with their positions at the time of the IPO to identify any discrepancies.\n- **Step 5:** Compile the findings and determine which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about identifying a person in the monday.com C-suite who did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The current members of the monday.com C-suite are:\n     - Roy Mann: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eran Zinman: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eliran Glazer: CFO\n     - Casey George: Chief Revenue Officer\n     - Shiran Nawi: Chief People and Legal Officer\n     - Daniel Lereya: Chief Product and Technology Officer\n   - The date of monday.com's IPO is June 10, 2021.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite positions held by the current members of the monday.com C-suite at the time of the IPO.\n   - Specific roles and timelines for Eran Zinman, Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya around the IPO date.\n   - Sources for this information could include:\n     - Company press releases and SEC filings related to the IPO.\n     - LinkedIn profiles of the C-suite members.\n     - News articles and business reports covering the IPO and subsequent leadership changes.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the current C-suite members with their roles at the time of the IPO to identify any discrepancies.\n   - Determining the timeline of any promotions or new hires within the C-suite since the IPO.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that IPOs often involve significant changes in leadership structure, it is possible that some current C-suite members were not in their current roles or were not part of the company at all during the IPO.\n   - The CEO and CFO are likely to have been in place during the IPO, but other roles such as CMO, CTO, or CHRO might have changed hands.\n   - Based on the information from Craft.co and the official monday.com website, it appears that Roy Mann and Eran Zinman have been in their Co-CEO roles since before the IPO. However, the roles of Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya need further verification.\n   - It is reasonable to hypothesize that Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya might have been in different roles or not part of the C-suite at the time of the IPO, given that their current roles are relatively specialized and may have been created or filled after the IPO to support the company's growth.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Search for specific roles and timelines for Eran Zinman, Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya around the IPO date.**\n2. **Review company press releases, SEC filings, and news articles for any announcements regarding leadership changes around the IPO date.**\n3. **Check LinkedIn profiles for detailed career histories of these individuals.**\n\nLet's proceed with these steps to gather the necessary information and confirm our educated guesses.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Lack of Specificity in Searches**: The searches were too broad and did not focus on specific individuals and their roles at the time of the IPO.\n2. **Repetition of Searches**: We repeated similar searches multiple times without refining the queries or using more targeted sources.\n3. **Insufficient Use of Detailed Sources**: We did not fully utilize detailed sources like SEC filings, company press releases, and LinkedIn profiles to verify the roles of the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n4. **Lack of Cross-Referencing**: We did not systematically cross-reference the information found across multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific search terms for each individual, e.g., \"Eran Zinman role at monday.com IPO June 10, 2021\".\n   - Include terms like \"SEC filing\", \"press release\", and \"LinkedIn profile\" in the search queries to target specific sources.\n\n2. **Utilize Detailed Sources**:\n   - **SEC Filings**: Search for SEC filings related to the IPO to find official documentation of the C-suite roles.\n   - **Company Press Releases**: Look for press releases from the time of the IPO to find announcements about the leadership team.\n   - **LinkedIn Profiles**: Check the LinkedIn profiles of each C-suite member for detailed career histories.\n\n3. **Systematic Cross-Referencing**:\n   - Create a table or list to track the roles of each C-suite member at the time of the IPO.\n   - Cross-reference the information found in different sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Execution**:\n   - **Step 1**: Search for and review SEC filings related to the IPO.\n   - **Step 2**: Search for and review company press releases from the time of the IPO.\n   - **Step 3**: Check the LinkedIn profiles of Eran Zinman, Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya.\n   - **Step 4**: Compile the findings and cross-reference them to identify any discrepancies.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Search for SEC Filings**:\n   - Use the search query: \"monday.com SEC filing IPO June 10, 2021\".\n   - Review the S-1 filing and other relevant documents to find the C-suite roles at the time of the IPO.\n\n2. **Search for Company Press Releases**:\n   - Use the search query: \"monday.com press release IPO June 10, 2021\".\n   - Review press releases from the time of the IPO to find announcements about the leadership team.\n\n3. **Check LinkedIn Profiles**:\n   - Use the search query: \"Eran Zinman LinkedIn\".\n   - Repeat for Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya.\n   - Review the career history sections to find their roles at the time of the IPO.\n\n4. **Compile and Cross-Reference Findings**:\n   - Create a table or list with the following columns: Name, Current Role, Role at IPO, Source.\n   - Fill in the table with the information found from SEC filings, press releases, and LinkedIn profiles.\n   - Identify any discrepancies and determine which C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Example Table\n\n| Name            | Current Role                  | Role at IPO                  | Source              |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Eran Zinman     | Co-Founder & Co-CEO           | Co-Founder & Co-CEO          | SEC Filing, LinkedIn|\n| Eliran Glazer   | CFO                           | CFO                          | SEC Filing, LinkedIn|\n| Casey George    | Chief Revenue Officer         | [Role at IPO]                | [Source]            |\n| Shiran Nawi     | Chief People and Legal Officer| [Role at IPO]                | [Source]            |\n| Daniel Lereya   | Chief Product and Technology Officer | [Role at IPO] | [Source]            |\n\nBy following this new plan, we can avoid the previous issues and systematically gather and verify the required information."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about identifying a person in the monday.com C-suite who did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The current members of the monday.com C-suite are:\n     - Roy Mann: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eran Zinman: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eliran Glazer: CFO\n     - Casey George: Chief Revenue Officer\n     - Shiran Nawi: Chief People and Legal Officer\n     - Daniel Lereya: Chief Product and Technology Officer\n   - The date of monday.com's IPO is June 10, 2021.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite positions held by the current members of the monday.com C-suite at the time of the IPO.\n   - Specific roles and timelines for Eran Zinman, Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya around the IPO date.\n   - Sources for this information could include:\n     - Company press releases and SEC filings related to the IPO.\n     - LinkedIn profiles of the C-suite members.\n     - News articles and business reports covering the IPO and subsequent leadership changes.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the current C-suite members with their roles at the time of the IPO to identify any discrepancies.\n   - Determining the timeline of any promotions or new hires within the C-suite since the IPO.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that IPOs often involve significant changes in leadership structure, it is possible that some current C-suite members were not in their current roles or were not part of the company at all during the IPO.\n   - The CEO and CFO are likely to have been in place during the IPO, but other roles such as CMO, CTO, or CHRO might have changed hands.\n   - Based on the information from Craft.co and the official monday.com website, it appears that Roy Mann and Eran Zinman have been in their Co-CEO roles since before the IPO. However, the roles of Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya need further verification.\n   - It is reasonable to hypothesize that Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya might have been in different roles or not part of the C-suite at the time of the IPO, given that their current roles are relatively specialized and may have been created or filled after the IPO to support the company's growth.\n\n### Additional Hunches and Reasoning\n- **Casey George**: As the Chief Revenue Officer, this role is crucial for a growing company, especially post-IPO. It is possible that this role was created or expanded after the IPO to manage the increased revenue streams and sales efforts.\n- **Shiran Nawi**: The role of Chief People and Legal Officer is also a specialized and important position, particularly for managing HR and legal affairs. This role might have been created or expanded to support the company's rapid growth post-IPO.\n- **Daniel Lereya**: The role of Chief Product and Technology Officer is critical for a tech company. It is possible that this role was either created or expanded to manage the technical and product development aspects of the company post-IPO.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Search for specific roles and timelines for Eran Zinman, Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya around the IPO date.**\n2. **Review company press releases, SEC filings, and news articles for any announcements regarding leadership changes around the IPO date.**\n3. **Check LinkedIn profiles for detailed career histories of these individuals.**\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **Search for SEC Filings**:\n   - Use the search query: \"monday.com SEC filing IPO June 10, 2021 S-1 filing\".\n   - Review the S-1 filing and other relevant documents to find the C-suite roles at the time of the IPO.\n\n2. **Search for Company Press Releases**:\n   - Use the search query: \"monday.com press release IPO June 10, 2021\".\n   - Review press releases from the time of the IPO to find announcements about the leadership team.\n\n3. **Check LinkedIn Profiles**:\n   - Use the search query: \"Eran Zinman LinkedIn\".\n   - Repeat for Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya.\n   - Review the career history sections to find their roles at the time of the IPO.\n\n4. **Compile and Cross-Reference Findings**:\n   - Create a table or list with the following columns: Name, Current Role, Role at IPO, Source.\n   - Fill in the table with the information found from SEC filings, press releases, and LinkedIn profiles.\n   - Identify any discrepancies and determine which C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Example Table\n\n| Name            | Current Role                  | Role at IPO                  | Source              |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Eran Zinman     | Co-Founder & Co-CEO           | Co-Founder & Co-CEO          | SEC Filing, LinkedIn|\n| Eliran Glazer   | CFO                           | CFO                          | SEC Filing, LinkedIn|\n| Casey George    | Chief Revenue Officer         | [Role at IPO]                | [Source]            |\n| Shiran Nawi     | Chief People and Legal Officer| [Role at IPO]                | [Source]            |\n| Daniel Lereya   | Chief Product and Technology Officer | [Role at IPO] | [Source]            |\n\nBy following this updated plan, we can systematically gather and verify the required information to identify the C-suite member who did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Lack of Specificity in Searches**: The searches were too broad and did not focus on specific individuals and their roles at the time of the IPO.\n2. **Repetition of Searches**: We repeated similar searches multiple times without refining the queries or using more targeted sources.\n3. **Insufficient Use of Detailed Sources**: We did not fully utilize detailed sources like SEC filings, company press releases, and LinkedIn profiles to verify the roles of the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n4. **Lack of Systematic Cross-Referencing**: We did not systematically cross-reference the information found across multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific search terms for each individual, e.g., \"Eran Zinman role at monday.com IPO June 10, 2021\".\n   - Include terms like \"SEC filing\", \"press release\", and \"LinkedIn profile\" in the search queries to target specific sources.\n\n2. **Utilize Detailed Sources**:\n   - **SEC Filings**: Search for SEC filings related to the IPO to find official documentation of the C-suite roles.\n   - **Company Press Releases**: Look for press releases from the time of the IPO to find announcements about the leadership team.\n   - **LinkedIn Profiles**: Check the LinkedIn profiles of each C-suite member for detailed career histories.\n\n3. **Systematic Cross-Referencing**:\n   - Create a table or list to track the roles of each C-suite member at the time of the IPO.\n   - Cross-reference the information found in different sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Execution**:\n   - **Step 1**: Search for and review SEC filings related to the IPO.\n   - **Step 2**: Search for and review company press releases from the time of the IPO.\n   - **Step 3**: Check the LinkedIn profiles of Eran Zinman, Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya.\n   - **Step 4**: Compile the findings and cross-reference them to identify any discrepancies.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Search for SEC Filings**:\n   - Use the search query: \"monday.com SEC filing IPO June 10, 2021 S-1 filing\".\n   - Navigate to the SEC website and search for the S-1 filing.\n   - Review the S-1 filing to find the C-suite roles at the time of the IPO.\n\n2. **Search for Company Press Releases**:\n   - Use the search query: \"monday.com press release IPO June 10, 2021\".\n   - Review press releases from the time of the IPO to find announcements about the leadership team.\n\n3. **Check LinkedIn Profiles**:\n   - Use the search query: \"Eran Zinman LinkedIn\".\n   - Repeat for Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya.\n   - Review the career history sections to find their roles at the time of the IPO.\n\n4. **Compile and Cross-Reference Findings**:\n   - Create a table or list with the following columns: Name, Current Role, Role at IPO, Source.\n   - Fill in the table with the information found from SEC filings, press releases, and LinkedIn profiles.\n   - Identify any discrepancies and determine which C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Example Table\n\n| Name            | Current Role                  | Role at IPO                  | Source              |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Eran Zinman     | Co-Founder & Co-CEO           | Co-Founder & Co-CEO          | SEC Filing, LinkedIn|\n| Eliran Glazer   | CFO                           | CFO                          | SEC Filing, LinkedIn|\n| Casey George    | Chief Revenue Officer         | [Role at IPO]                | [Source]            |\n| Shiran Nawi     | Chief People and Legal Officer| [Role at IPO]                | [Source]            |\n| Daniel Lereya   | Chief Product and Technology Officer | [Role at IPO] | [Source]            |\n\nBy following this new plan, we can avoid the previous issues and systematically gather and verify the required information."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser.

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and refined educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about identifying a person in the monday.com C-suite who did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The current members of the monday.com C-suite are:\n     - Roy Mann: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eran Zinman: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eliran Glazer: CFO\n     - Casey George: Chief Revenue Officer\n     - Shiran Nawi: Chief People and Legal Officer\n     - Daniel Lereya: Chief Product and Technology Officer\n   - The date of monday.com's IPO is June 10, 2021.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite positions held by the current members of the monday.com C-suite at the time of the IPO.\n   - Specific roles and timelines for Eran Zinman, Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya around the IPO date.\n   - Sources for this information could include:\n     - Company press releases and SEC filings related to the IPO.\n     - LinkedIn profiles of the C-suite members.\n     - News articles and business reports covering the IPO and subsequent leadership changes.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the current C-suite members with their roles at the time of the IPO to identify any discrepancies.\n   - Determining the timeline of any promotions or new hires within the C-suite since the IPO.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that IPOs often involve significant changes in leadership structure, it is possible that some current C-suite members were not in their current roles or were not part of the company at all during the IPO.\n   - The CEO and CFO are likely to have been in place during the IPO, but other roles such as CMO, CTO, or CHRO might have changed hands.\n   - Based on the information from Craft.co and the official monday.com website, it appears that Roy Mann and Eran Zinman have been in their Co-CEO roles since before the IPO. However, the roles of Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya need further verification.\n   - **Casey George**: As the Chief Revenue Officer, this role is crucial for a growing company, especially post-IPO. It is possible that this role was created or expanded after the IPO to manage the increased revenue streams and sales efforts.\n   - **Shiran Nawi**: The role of Chief People and Legal Officer is also a specialized and important position, particularly for managing HR and legal affairs. This role might have been created or expanded to support the company's rapid growth post-IPO.\n   - **Daniel Lereya**: The role of Chief Product and Technology Officer is critical for a tech company. It is possible that this role was either created or expanded to manage the technical and product development aspects of the company post-IPO.\n   - **Eliran Glazer**: Given his role as CFO, it is highly likely that he was in this position during the IPO, as financial management is crucial during such a significant event.\n\n### Additional Hunches and Reasoning\n- **Casey George**: The role of Chief Revenue Officer is often created or expanded post-IPO to handle the increased sales and revenue management needs. Therefore, it is a strong possibility that Casey George was not in this role during the IPO.\n- **Shiran Nawi**: The role of Chief People and Legal Officer is another specialized position that might have been created or expanded post-IPO to manage the growing HR and legal needs of the company. Thus, it is possible that Shiran Nawi was not in this role during the IPO.\n- **Daniel Lereya**: The role of Chief Product and Technology Officer is critical for a tech company, and it is possible that this role was created or expanded post-IPO to manage the technical and product development aspects. Therefore, Daniel Lereya might not have been in this role during the IPO.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Search for specific roles and timelines for Eran Zinman, Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya around the IPO date.**\n2. **Review company press releases, SEC filings, and news articles for any announcements regarding leadership changes around the IPO date.**\n3. **Check LinkedIn profiles for detailed career histories of these individuals.**\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **Search for SEC Filings**:\n   - Use the search query: \"monday.com SEC filing IPO June 10, 2021 S-1 filing\".\n   - Review the S-1 filing and other relevant documents to find the C-suite roles at the time of the IPO.\n\n2. **Search for Company Press Releases**:\n   - Use the search query: \"monday.com press release IPO June 10, 2021\".\n   - Review press releases from the time of the IPO to find announcements about the leadership team.\n\n3. **Check LinkedIn Profiles**:\n   - Use the search query: \"Eran Zinman LinkedIn\".\n   - Repeat for Eliran Glazer, Casey George, Shiran Nawi, and Daniel Lereya.\n   - Review the career history sections to find their roles at the time of the IPO.\n\n4. **Compile and Cross-Reference Findings**:\n   - Create a table or list with the following columns: Name, Current Role, Role at IPO, Source.\n   - Fill in the table with the information found from SEC filings, press releases, and LinkedIn profiles.\n   - Identify any discrepancies and determine which C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Example Table\n\n| Name            | Current Role                  | Role at IPO                  | Source              |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Eran Zinman     | Co-Founder & Co-CEO           | Co-Founder & Co-CEO          | SEC Filing, LinkedIn|\n| Eliran Glazer   | CFO                           | CFO                          | SEC Filing, LinkedIn|\n| Casey George    | Chief Revenue Officer         | [Role at IPO]                | [Source]            |\n| Shiran Nawi     | Chief People and Legal Officer| [Role at IPO]                | [Source]            |\n| Daniel Lereya   | Chief Product and Technology Officer | [Role at IPO] | [Source]            |\n\nBy following this updated plan, we can systematically gather and verify the required information to identify the C-suite member who did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Rate Limiting and Automated Access Restrictions**:\n   - The SEC website has strict rate limits and restrictions on automated access. Our attempts to access the S-1 filing directly from the SEC website triggered these restrictions, preventing us from retrieving the necessary information.\n   \n2. **Inefficient Search Strategies**:\n   - Our search queries were not optimized to find cached versions or direct PDF links to the S-1 filing. This led to repeated attempts to access the SEC website, which were unsuccessful due to the rate limiting.\n\n3. **Lack of Alternative Sources**:\n   - We did not explore alternative sources such as company press releases, financial news websites, or investor relations pages, which could have provided the necessary information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Alternative Sources for S-1 Filing**:\n   - **Search for Cached Versions or Direct PDF Links**:\n     - Use search queries like \"monday.com S-1 filing PDF June 10, 2021 cached\" or \"monday.com S-1 filing PDF June 10, 2021 direct link\".\n     - Check financial news websites and investor relations pages for the S-1 filing.\n\n2. **Review Company Press Releases and Investor Relations Pages**:\n   - **Search for Press Releases**:\n     - Use search queries like \"monday.com press release IPO June 10, 2021\".\n     - Visit the investor relations page of monday.com (https://ir.monday.com) to find relevant press releases and documents.\n\n3. **Check LinkedIn Profiles for Detailed Career Histories**:\n   - **Search LinkedIn Profiles**:\n     - Use search queries like \"Eran Zinman LinkedIn\", \"Eliran Glazer LinkedIn\", \"Casey George LinkedIn\", \"Shiran Nawi LinkedIn\", and \"Daniel Lereya LinkedIn\".\n     - Review the career history sections to find their roles at the time of the IPO.\n\n4. **Compile and Cross-Reference Findings**:\n   - **Create a Table**:\n     - Create a table with the following columns: Name, Current Role, Role at IPO, Source.\n     - Fill in the table with the information found from the S-1 filing, press releases, and LinkedIn profiles.\n     - Identify any discrepancies and determine which C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Search for Cached Versions or Direct PDF Links**:\n   - Use the search query: \"monday.com S-1 filing PDF June 10, 2021 cached\".\n   - Use the search query: \"monday.com S-1 filing PDF June 10, 2021 direct link\".\n\n2. **Review Company Press Releases and Investor Relations Pages**:\n   - Use the search query: \"monday.com press release IPO June 10, 2021\".\n   - Visit the investor relations page of monday.com (https://ir.monday.com) to find relevant press releases and documents.\n\n3. **Check LinkedIn Profiles**:\n   - Use the search query: \"Eran Zinman LinkedIn\".\n   - Use the search query: \"Eliran Glazer LinkedIn\".\n   - Use the search query: \"Casey George LinkedIn\".\n   - Use the search query: \"Shiran Nawi LinkedIn\".\n   - Use the search query: \"Daniel Lereya LinkedIn\".\n   - Review the career history sections to find their roles at the time of the IPO.\n\n4. **Compile and Cross-Reference Findings**:\n   - Create a table with the following columns: Name, Current Role, Role at IPO, Source.\n   - Fill in the table with the information found from the S-1 filing, press releases, and LinkedIn profiles.\n   - Identify any discrepancies and determine which C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Example Table\n\n| Name            | Current Role                  | Role at IPO                  | Source              |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Eran Zinman     | Co-Founder & Co-CEO           | Co-Founder & Co-CEO          | SEC Filing, LinkedIn|\n| Eliran Glazer   | CFO                           | CFO                          | SEC Filing, LinkedIn|\n| Casey George    | Chief Revenue Officer         | [Role at IPO]                | [Source]            |\n| Shiran Nawi     | Chief People and Legal Officer| [Role at IPO]                | [Source]            |\n| Daniel Lereya   | Chief Product and Technology Officer | [Role at IPO] | [Source]            |\n\nBy following this new plan, we can avoid the previous issues and systematically gather and verify the required information."}
