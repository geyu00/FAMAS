There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - The paper contained a diagram of an X-ray time profile.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts in July 2020.\n   - The user wants to know the difference in seconds in the measured time span between the two diagrams.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact measured time span of the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact measured time span of the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - The specific papers and their titles, as well as the authors involved, to ensure accurate data retrieval.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans once the exact values are obtained.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The time spans might be in the range of milliseconds to seconds, given the nature of fast radio bursts.\n   - The difference in time spans could be small, possibly within a few seconds, but this is speculative without the actual data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Papers**: Use WebSurfer to search for the specific papers mentioned (March 2021 and July 2020) on Arxiv or other academic databases.\n- **Extract Time Spans**: Once the papers are located, use WebSurfer to find and extract the exact measured time spans from the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper and the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n- **Calculate the Difference**: Use Assistant to calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n- **Provide the Answer**: Deliver the calculated difference in seconds to the user."}

Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks to be the only viable strategy. Additionally, small/medium size radiotelescopes co-pointing higher energies telescopes look a very interesting and cheap complementary observational strategy. \nComments:\n44 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication on Universe\nSubjects:\nHigh Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)Cite as:\narXiv:2103.07786 [astro-ph.HE] \n(or \narXiv:2103.07786v2 [astro-ph.HE] for this version) \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2103.07786\nFocus to learn more\nJournal reference:\nUniverse 2021, 7, 76\nRelated DOI: \nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/universe7030076\nFocus to learn more\nSubmission history\n From: Luciano Nicastro Dr. [\nview email] \n[v1] Sat, 13 Mar 2021 20:39:49 UTC (14,577 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 25 Mar 2021 10:44:14 UTC (1,195 KB)\nAccess Paper:\nView PDFTeX SourceOther Formatsview license Current browse context: \nastro-ph.HE\n< prev  |  \nnext >new \n | recent \n | 2021-03 Change to browse by: \nastro-phReferences & Citations\nINSPIRE HEPNASA ADSGoogle ScholarSemantic Scholarexport BibTeX citation\nBookmark\n Bibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer \nCode, Data, Media\nDemos\nRelated Papers\n About arXivLabs\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"msapplication-TileColor\": \"#da532c\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"description\": \"Abstract page for arXiv paper 2103.07786: Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"arXiv.org\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786v2\",\n        \"og:image\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:secure_url\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"1200\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"700\",\n        \"og:image:alt\": \"arXiv logo\",\n        \"og:description\": \"The origin and phenomenology of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) remains unknown despite more than a decade of efforts.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - The paper titled \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\" was published on March 13, 2021, by authors including Luciano Nicastro, Cristiano Guidorzi, Eliana Palazzi, Luca Zampieri, Massimo Turatto, and Angela Gardini.\n   - The March 2021 paper contained a diagram of an X-ray time profile.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts in July 2020.\n   - The user wants to know the difference in seconds in the measured time span between the two diagrams.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact measured time span of the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact measured time span of the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - The specific title and authors of the July 2020 paper to ensure accurate data retrieval.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans once the exact values are obtained.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The time spans might be in the range of milliseconds to seconds, given the nature of fast radio bursts.\n   - The difference in time spans could be small, possibly within a few seconds, but this is speculative without the actual data.\n   - Given the similarity in the topics and the involvement of the same authors, the papers likely focus on similar aspects of fast radio bursts, which could mean that the time spans are comparable but not identical.\n   - The July 2020 paper might be titled similarly to the March 2021 paper, possibly including terms like \"multiwavelength observations\" or \"fast radio bursts.\"\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The similarity in topics and the involvement of the same authors suggest that the papers are closely related, which could mean that the time spans are in a similar range.\n- The nature of fast radio bursts typically involves very short durations, often in the millisecond range, which supports the guess that the time spans are likely to be in milliseconds to seconds.\n- The specific title and authors of the July 2020 paper are crucial for accurate retrieval and comparison, and the similarity in titles could help in narrowing down the search.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Ineffective Search Queries**: The search queries used to find the July 2020 paper were too broad and did not yield the specific paper we were looking for. The search terms need to be more precise and targeted.\n- **Lack of Specificity in Author Names**: The search included multiple authors, which diluted the results. Focusing on a single author or a more specific combination of authors might yield better results.\n- **Insufficient Verification of Results**: The search results were not thoroughly checked to ensure they matched the criteria (July 2020, multiwavelength observations, and the same authors).\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Refine Search Query**: Use a more specific search query to find the July 2020 paper. Focus on a single author and include keywords like \"multiwavelength observations\" and \"fast radio bursts.\"\n- **Verify Results**: Ensure that the search results match the criteria (published in July 2020, by the same authors, and relevant to multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts).\n- **Extract Time Spans**: Once the papers are located, extract the exact measured time spans from the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper and the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n- **Calculate Difference**: Compute the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Refine Search Query for July 2020 Paper**\n   - Use a more specific search query: \"multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts July 2020 author:Cristiano Guidorzi\"\n   - If this does not yield results, try other authors individually or in combinations.\n\n2. **Verify Results**\n   - Check the publication date to ensure it is July 2020.\n   - Verify the authors to ensure they are the same as those in the March 2021 paper.\n   - Confirm the relevance to multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts.\n\n3. **Extract Time Spans**\n   - Open the March 2021 paper and locate the X-ray time profile diagram.\n   - Extract the exact measured time span from the diagram.\n   - Open the July 2020 paper and locate the burst-1 diagram.\n   - Extract the exact measured time span from the diagram.\n\n4. **Calculate Difference**\n   - Use the extracted time spans to calculate the difference in seconds.\n   - Provide the calculated difference to the user.\n\n### Execution\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Query**\n  - Perform a web search using the refined query: \"multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts July 2020 author:Cristiano Guidorzi\"\n\n- **Step 2: Verify Results**\n  - Check the publication date, authors, and relevance of the search results.\n\n- **Step 3: Extract Time Spans**\n  - Open the March 2021 paper: [[2103.07786] Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786)\n  - Locate and extract the X-ray time profile diagram.\n  - Open the July 2020 paper (once found) and locate the burst-1 diagram.\n  - Extract the exact measured time spans from both diagrams.\n\n- **Step 4: Calculate Difference**\n  - Use the extracted time spans to compute the difference in seconds.\n  - Provide the calculated difference to the user.\n\nLet's start with the refined search query.\n\nCan you search for a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts published in July 2020 by Cristiano Guidorzi?

Introduction\n\nThe multiwavelength (MWL) approach to study transient astronomical events has demonstrated its\neffectiveness in solving many puzzles in astronomy, both related to “local” and extragalactic sources. The\nGamma Ray Burst (GRB) phenomenon represents a perfect example. Wide area detectors (e.g., high-energy\nmonitors) or speciﬁc surveys monitoring large areas of the sky can detect events that only last for a short\nperiod of time. Being able to reduce positional uncertainties and perform timely MWL observations\nusing sensitive and high-enough resolution instruments could be the only way to discriminate among\nthe possible progenitors. This is a key point when the transient astronomical event is only detected in a\n\nUniverse 2021, 7, 76; doi:10.3390/universe7030076\n\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/universe\n\n\fUniverse 2021, 7, 76\n\n2 of 48\n\nsingle band of the electromagnetic spectrum or when multiple sources could produce that event. Studying\nthe source emission in a as wide as possible spectral band justiﬁes huge efforts in terms of observational\ntime and manpower. It, typically, turns out to be the only way to solve the most challenging questions in\nastrophysics.\n\nFast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are among the most studied astrophysical transients, still their origin and\nwhether there are multiple types of progenitors and emission mechanisms are still open questions (see [1–5]\nfor a review). Are (apparently) one-off and repeating events representative of distinct samples or are they\nthe realization of a very wide timescales distribution of the same objects class? Can the periodicity seen in\na few FRBs be reconciled with the proposed models? Is the behavior distinctive of a class or sub-class of\nFRBs? Of the about 140 distinct sources known [https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/] (accessed on 1 March 2021)\n(but we are aware that many more have been discovered but remain unpublished at the time of writing this\nreview), only for a bunch of them a MWL search campaign was possible, in particular for the two repeating\n(and periodic) sources FRB 20121102A (commonly referred as FRB 121102) and FRB 20180916B (also referred\nas FRB 180916 and FRB 180916.J0158+65, see below for the details). What makes FRB searches even more\nchallenging than for other transients"}
