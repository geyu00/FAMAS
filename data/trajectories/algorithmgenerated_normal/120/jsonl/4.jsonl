Please solve the task carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify restaurants (not takeaway only) within 1 block of Washington Square Park that offer vegan main dishes for under $15.\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The local expert will identify restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n2. The vegan food expert will check the menus of these restaurants to find vegan main dishes priced under $15.\n3. The checker will verify the accuracy of the information provided by the local expert and the vegan food expert.\n## Output format\nList of restaurants with their names and addresses that offer vegan main dishes for under $15.\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The restaurants must be within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n- The restaurants must not be takeaway only.\n- The vegan main dishes must be priced under $15.\n## Results (including code blocks) and reason from last response\nThe identified restaurants meeting all the criteria are:\n1. **By Chloe** - 185 Bleecker Street, New York, NY 10012\n2. **Saigon Shack** - 114 MacDougal Street, New York, NY 10012\n3. **Greenwich Village Bistro** - 13 Carmine Street, New York, NY 10014\n4. **Peacefood Cafe** - 41 E 11th Street, New York, NY 10003\n5. **Murray's Falafel & Grill** - 261 6th Avenue, New York, NY 10014\n6. **Mamouns Falafel** - 119 MacDougal Street, New York, NY 10012\n\n## Reason for the results\nThe Vegan Food Expert performed menu searches to confirm vegan main dishes priced under $15, and the Verification Expert validated the proximity to Washington Square Park, pricing, and that these restaurants are not takeaway only.\n\n## Errors or issues in the conversation\n1. **Execution Error**: There was an execution error due to an undefined `perform_web_search` function, leading the expert to perform manual searches instead.\n2. **Potentially Outdated Data**: Some sources referenced various years and the specific menu details might need reconfirmation for the current year (2023).\n\n### Need to double-check?\nYes"}
{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "To verify the results for the identified restaurants, I'll check the information against any relevant data or databases available to confirm that they indeed have vegan main dishes priced under $15, and that they meet the criteria of being within 1 block of Washington Square Park and not being takeaway only.\n\n### Verification Steps:\n1. Confirm that each restaurant is within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n2. Verify that each restaurant has at least one vegan main dish that is priced under $15.\n3. Check that none of these restaurants operate as takeaway only.\n\nI'll start by cross-referencing the addresses provided with the location of Washington Square Park and then look up the menus for vegan options.\n\n### Data to check:\n- **Washington Square Park Coordinates**: approximately at 40.7308° N, 73.9973° W.\n- We'll check each restaurant's address.\n\nBased on the addresses:\n1. **By Chloe** - 185 Bleecker Street\n2. **Saigon Shack** - 114 MacDougal Street\n3. **Greenwich Village Bistro** - 13 Carmine Street\n4. **Peacefood Cafe** - 41 E 11th Street\n5. **Murray's Falafel & Grill** - 261 6th Avenue\n6. **Mamouns Falafel** - 119 MacDougal Street\n\nNow, I will write a plan to check if each of these addresses meets the criteria mentioned and confirm if they have vegan mains under $15.\n\n### Plan for the verification:\n- Check each address on a map service for the distance to Washington Square Park.\n- Lookup restaurant menus for vegan dishes and their pricing.\n\n### Action:\nI will initiate a search for each restaurant to confirm the criteria mentioned.
