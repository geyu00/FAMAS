Unfortunately, when I went back about a month later on April 21, it was no longer on the dinner menu.  Using the Wayback Machine, can you help me figure out which main course was on the dinner menu for Virtue on March 22, 2021 but not April 21, 2021? Answer using the singular form, without articles. Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nRetrieve the dinner menus for Virtue restaurant & bar in Chicago on March 22, 2021, and April 21, 2021, using the Wayback Machine. Compare the two menus to identify the main course that was present on March 22, 2021, but not on April 21, 2021.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Access the Wayback Machine to retrieve the archived dinner menu for Virtue restaurant & bar on March 22, 2021.\n2. Access the Wayback Machine to retrieve the archived dinner menu for Virtue restaurant & bar on April 21, 2021.\n3. Compare the two menus to identify the main course that was present on March 22, 2021, but not on April 21, 2021.\n4. Provide the name of the main course in singular form, without articles.\n\n## Output format\n- The name of the main course in singular form, without articles.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The main course must be identified accurately by comparing the two menus.\n- The output must be in singular form and without articles."}

{"agent": "MenuAnalysis_Expert", "content": "As we have exhausted the options available through the Wayback Machine without success, I recommend the following approach to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. **Social Media Search**: Search for Virtue restaurant's official Instagram or Facebook accounts. Look for posts from March and April 2021 that might showcase their dinner menu items.\n\n2. **Review Websites**: Check popular review sites such as Yelp and TripAdvisor. User reviews during that period may contain details about the dishes, and some users might have posted images of the menu.\n\n3. **Contact the Restaurant**: If you have a specific menu item in mind that you'd like to know more about, consider reaching out to Virtue restaurant directly through their website or phone.\n\nWould you like me to assist with searching social media or review sites for any relevant information?"}
