{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "To begin, I'll need to verify the provided dataset against the criteria outlined in the task. This involves checking the dataset for records of houses sold in Prince Edward Island with at least 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, within the specified date range of June 1, 2022, to May 15, 2024.\n\nHereâ€™s how I will approach the verification process:\n\n1. **Review the Sample Dataset**: I'll analyze the dataset to determine if it includes the necessary attributes (e.g., square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, sale date, location) and validate its representativeness of the actual data on Zillow.\n\n2. **Verify the Function**: After confirming that the dataset is suitable, I'll check the function used to filter and find the smallest house by ensuring it correctly implements the logic needed to extract the relevant records according to the specified conditions.\n\nCould you please provide the sample dataset and the function that you would like me to verify?"}

To proceed with the verification process, we first need to check the sample dataset that contains the necessary attributes: square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, sale date, and location.
