Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about identifying which person in the Monday.com C-suite did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The current C-suite members of Monday.com.\n   - The date of Monday.com's IPO.\n   - The C-suite members of Monday.com at the time of its IPO.\n   - Sources for this information could include:\n     - Monday.com’s official website.\n     - SEC filings and press releases related to the IPO.\n     - News articles and business journals covering the IPO and subsequent leadership changes.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Compare the current C-suite members with those who were in place at the time of the IPO to identify any discrepancies.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that the CEO and CFO would have been part of the C-suite during the IPO, but other positions such as CMO, CTO, or CHRO might have changed over time.\n   - Given the rapid growth and evolution of tech companies, it's possible that some C-suite roles were added post-IPO.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find the current C-suite members of Monday.com.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for the date of Monday.com's IPO and the C-suite members at that time.\n- **Assistant**: Compare the current C-suite members with those from the IPO period to identify any differences.\n- **Assistant**: Compile the findings and determine which current C-suite member was not in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n- **Assistant**: Present the final answer."}

Goldman Sachs is leading the IPO and the company plans to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “MNDY.”\nUnlike most S-1's, Monday's starts with a letter from the founders that describes their mission: \"to give our customers the power to create their own work software.\" The company also calls this new category of software Work OS, which \"democratizes the power of software so organizations can easily build software applications and work management tools that fit their needs.\" According to the S-1, the company has raised $234M, and most recently a $150M round led by Sapphire at a $1.9B valuation in June of 2019 (more on their investors below). The company will hope for a more controlled pricing vs. \nSquarespace, another SaaS IPO that went public this week which is roughly at their reference price of $50/share and 35% below their last funding round at $10B in March (as of 20-May-2021). Squarespace went public through a direct listing and Monday will go out through a traditional IPO.\nMonday's product is a highly configurable (and collaborative) set of software building blocks where users can build their own workflows and is the first IPO from the next generation of low-code tools from companies like Airtable, ClickUp, and Notion. Monday offers a pliable, no-code way for users (both technical and non-technical) to create their own software applications and workflows through categories of building blocks. The company mentions that across their 127,974 customers, there are thousands of use-cases, mostly in 3 main categories 1) business-critical software applications, 2) work management tools and 3) connective layers to form a unified workplace and integrate applications across an organization. More practically speaking, it includes things such as project management, task management, inventory tracking, issue tracking, building your own CRM, etc. More on the product later in this post.\n×\n By using this website, you consent to the real-time collection, storage, use, and sharing of personal information using cookies and other session-replay technologies by Meritech and/or its third-party partners, including in connection with the videos on our site.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about identifying which person in the Monday.com C-suite did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The current C-suite members of Monday.com are:\n     - Casey George: Chief Revenue Officer\n     - Roy Mann: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eran Zinman: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eliran Glazer: CFO\n     - Shiran Nawi: Chief People and Legal Officer\n     - Daniel Lereya: Chief Product and Technology Officer\n   - Monday.com's IPO took place on June 10, 2021.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite members of Monday.com at the time of its IPO (June 10, 2021).\n   - Sources for this information could include:\n     - Official press releases from Monday.com.\n     - SEC filings related to the IPO.\n     - News articles and business journals covering the IPO and subsequent leadership changes.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Compare the current C-suite members with those who were in place at the time of the IPO to identify any discrepancies.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that the Co-CEOs (Roy Mann and Eran Zinman) and the CFO (Eliran Glazer) were part of the C-suite during the IPO, given their critical roles in the company.\n   - The positions of Chief Revenue Officer, Chief People and Legal Officer, and Chief Product and Technology Officer might have been added or changed post-IPO, as these roles are often introduced or modified as companies grow and scale.\n   - Given the rapid growth and evolution of tech companies, it's possible that some C-suite roles, particularly those focused on specific functions like revenue, people, and technology, were added post-IPO to support the company's expansion and operational needs.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Co-CEOs and CFO**: These roles are typically essential for a company going public, as they are crucial for leadership, strategy, and financial management.\n- **Other C-Suite Roles**: Positions like Chief Revenue Officer, Chief People and Legal Officer, and Chief Product and Technology Officer are often added or modified as a company grows to address specific needs and challenges. For example, a growing company might need a dedicated Chief Revenue Officer to manage expanding sales and revenue streams, or a Chief People and Legal Officer to handle HR and legal matters more comprehensively.\n\nThis updated fact sheet should help guide the next steps in finding the specific information needed to answer the question.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Broken Links and 404 Errors**: Several links to official press releases and investor relations pages resulted in 404 errors or request rejections, preventing us from accessing the required information.\n2. **Inconsistent Search Results**: Search queries for specific information (e.g., C-suite members at the time of IPO) returned either irrelevant or incomplete results, making it difficult to find the exact information needed.\n3. **Lack of Direct Access to Reliable Sources**: We were unable to directly access reliable sources such as SEC filings or official press releases due to the issues mentioned above.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Alternative Search Strategies**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a more targeted search using different keywords and combinations to find reliable sources. For example, search for \"Monday.com IPO press release June 2021\" and \"Monday.com leadership team June 2021.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use advanced search operators (e.g., `site:sec.gov`, `site:forbes.com`) to focus on specific domains known for reliable information.\n\n2. **Check Secondary Sources**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for reputable business journals and financial news sites (e.g., Forbes, Bloomberg, CNBC) that might have covered the IPO and listed the C-suite members at that time.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for articles or reports from around June 10, 2021, that discuss the IPO and the company's leadership.\n\n3. **Verify Information from Multiple Sources**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information found from multiple sources to ensure accuracy and reliability.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If possible, find and compare information from both primary (official company sources) and secondary (news articles) sources.\n\n4. **Use Wayback Machine**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If official pages are still inaccessible, use the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to access historical versions of the company's website and press releases from around the time of the IPO.\n\n5. **Summarize and Compare**:\n   - **Assistant**: Once the current and IPO-era C-suite members are identified, summarize the information and compare the two lists to identify any discrepancies.\n   - **Assistant**: Determine which current C-suite member was not in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Perform Targeted Searches**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Monday.com IPO press release June 2021\" and \"Monday.com leadership team June 2021.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use advanced search operators to focus on specific domains (e.g., `site:sec.gov`, `site:forbes.com`).\n\n2. **Check Secondary Sources**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for reputable business journals and financial news sites that covered the IPO and listed the C-suite members at that time.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for articles or reports from around June 10, 2021.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information found from multiple sources to ensure accuracy and reliability.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Find and compare information from both primary and secondary sources.\n\n4. **Use Wayback Machine**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If official pages are still inaccessible, use the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to access historical versions of the company's website and press releases from around the time of the IPO.\n\n5. **Summarize and Compare**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the information and compare the current and IPO-era C-suite members.\n   - **Assistant**: Identify which current C-suite member was not in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\nBy following this new plan, we aim to overcome the previous challenges and successfully identify the C-suite member who did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about identifying which person in the Monday.com C-suite did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n- The current C-suite members of Monday.com are:\n  - Casey George: Chief Revenue Officer\n  - Roy Mann: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n  - Eran Zinman: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n  - Eliran Glazer: CFO\n  - Shiran Nawi: Chief People and Legal Officer\n  - Daniel Lereya: Chief Product and Technology Officer\n- Monday.com's IPO took place on June 10, 2021.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The C-suite members of Monday.com at the time of its IPO (June 10, 2021).\n- Sources for this information could include:\n  - Official press releases from Monday.com.\n  - SEC filings related to the IPO.\n  - News articles and business journals covering the IPO and subsequent leadership changes.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Compare the current C-suite members with those who were in place at the time of the IPO to identify any discrepancies.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Co-CEOs (Roy Mann and Eran Zinman)**: It is highly likely that Roy Mann and Eran Zinman were part of the C-suite during the IPO, given their co-founder status and critical roles in the company.\n- **CFO (Eliran Glazer)**: It is also likely that Eliran Glazer was part of the C-suite during the IPO, as the CFO is a crucial role for a company going public.\n- **Chief Revenue Officer (Casey George)**: This position might have been added post-IPO to manage the growing sales and revenue streams as the company expanded.\n- **Chief People and Legal Officer (Shiran Nawi)**: This role might have been introduced post-IPO to handle the increasing complexity of HR and legal matters as the company grew.\n- **Chief Product and Technology Officer (Daniel Lereya)**: This position might have been added post-IPO to focus on product development and technological advancements as the company scaled.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Co-CEOs and CFO**: These roles are typically essential for a company going public, as they are crucial for leadership, strategy, and financial management.\n- **Other C-Suite Roles**: Positions like Chief Revenue Officer, Chief People and Legal Officer, and Chief Product and Technology Officer are often added or modified as a company grows to address specific needs and challenges. For example, a growing company might need a dedicated Chief Revenue Officer to manage expanding sales and revenue streams, or a Chief People and Legal Officer to handle HR and legal matters more comprehensively.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Use the Wayback Machine**: Navigate to the historical version of Monday.com's website from June 10, 2021, to find the C-suite members listed at that time.\n2. **Check SEC Filings**: Look for SEC filings related to the IPO to find detailed information about the company's leadership at the time of the IPO.\n3. **Review News Articles**: Search for news articles and business journals from around June 10, 2021, that cover the IPO and list the C-suite members at that time.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to verify the educated guesses and identify the C-suite member who did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The WebSurfer navigated to the wrong date (January 1, 2021) instead of June 10, 2021, when using the Wayback Machine.\n2. **Lack of Specificity**: The search queries and navigation steps were not specific enough to ensure the correct historical version of the website was accessed.\n3. **Repetition of Mistakes**: The same incorrect steps were repeated, leading to a lack of progress.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Date**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Input the URL `https://www.monday.com` in the search bar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the calendar icon to select the year 2021.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on June 2021.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on June 10, 2021, to access the archived version of the website from the IPO date.\n\n2. **Locate C-Suite Members**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once on the archived version of the website, search for the \"About Us\" or \"Leadership\" section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify and list the C-suite members mentioned on the website.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference with Current C-Suite**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the C-suite members from June 10, 2021, with the current C-suite members.\n   - **Assistant**: Identify which current C-suite member was not listed in the IPO-era C-suite.\n\n4. **Verify with Additional Sources**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for news articles and business journals from around June 10, 2021, that discuss the IPO and list the C-suite members at that time.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use advanced search operators like `site:forbes.com` and `site:cnbc.com` to focus on reputable sources.\n\n5. **Summarize and Conclude**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and clearly state which current C-suite member was not in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Date**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to https://web.archive.org.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Input `https://www.monday.com` in the search bar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the calendar icon and select June 10, 2021.\n\n2. **Locate C-Suite Members**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the \"About Us\" or \"Leadership\" section on the archived website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: List the C-suite members mentioned.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference with Current C-Suite**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the lists and identify discrepancies.\n\n4. **Verify with Additional Sources**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for news articles from June 10, 2021, using `site:forbes.com` and `site:cnbc.com`.\n\n5. **Summarize and Conclude**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final answer based on the findings."}
