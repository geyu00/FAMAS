It blew out a huge bi-lobed bubble that blasted through the interstellar medium in two directions. Whatever it was, it released huge amounts of energy from the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A\n (Sgr A for short).\nThese bubbles contain weird, spindly one-dimensional vertical filaments that emit radio signals of their own. In 1984, astronomer Farhad Yusef-Zadeh at Northwestern University and his collaborators were \nthe first to observe these wispy trails. Now, they know of more than a thousand of them. They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

However, these aren't vertical. Instead, they lie along the galactic plane and radiate away like spokes on a wheel. \"It was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole,\" Yusef-Zadeh said. \"We have always been thinking about vertical filaments and their origin. I'm used to them being vertical. I never considered there might be others along the plane.\"\nHe and the team were stunned when they saw these radially stretched structures. \"We had to do a lot of work to establish that we weren't fooling ourselves,\" he said. \"And we found that these filaments are not random but appear to be tied to the outflow of our black hole. By studying them, we could learn more about the black hole's spin and accretion disk orientation. It is satisfying when one finds order in a middle of a chaotic field of the nucleus of our galaxy.\"\nYusef-Zadeh pointed out that something clearly occurred in the core to create the short radial filaments. \"We think they must have originated with some kind of outflow from an activity that happened a few million years ago,\" he said. \"It seems to be the result of an interaction of that outflowing material with objects near it.\"\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Then, it \"burps out\" an energetic, highly magnetized blast of energy and plasma. That seems the most likely explanation for the appearance of the bubbles and filaments. It's possible that such a jet collided with clouds of gas and dust in the immediate neighborhood. It could have led to twisted magnetic structures that form the filaments.\nAnother idea is that molecular gas got stretched by the expansion of the material near the core. That somehow creates the radial filaments. Such action would also explain the lopsided appearance of the Sgr E complex. It lies to one side of the black hole at the intersection of the central molecular zone and a wide central dust lane. Finally, it's also possible that the gravitational potential of our galaxy's central bar is tugging the Sgr E cloud. That could play a role in forming those filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Once the paper is open, we will focus on the acknowledgments section to find the NASA award number.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Repetitive Clicking Issue:** The WebSurfer was repeatedly clicking on the same link without actually navigating to the research paper. This suggests that the link might not be functioning as expected or there might be an issue with the way the link is being identified and clicked.\n2. **Viewport Positioning:** The WebSurfer was consistently positioned at 81% down the page, which might indicate that the link is not within the current viewport or is not being recognized properly.\n3. **Lack of Confirmation:** There was no confirmation that the link was successfully clicked and the research paper was opened, leading to repeated attempts without verifying the outcome.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Scroll to the Bottom of the Article:** Ensure that the WebSurfer scrolls to the very bottom of the article to make sure the link to the research paper is within the viewport.\n2. **Identify and Click the Link:** Carefully identify the link to the research paper and click it. Use a more specific selector if necessary to ensure the correct link is clicked.\n3. **Verify Navigation:** After clicking the link, verify that the WebSurfer has successfully navigated to the research paper page. This can be done by checking the URL or the title of the page.\n4. **Read the Paper:** Once the research paper is open, read through it, focusing on the acknowledgments section or any part that mentions funding sources.\n5. **Extract the NASA Award Number:** Identify and extract the NASA award number under which R. G. Arendt's work was supported.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1:** Scroll to the bottom of the article to ensure the link to the research paper is within the viewport.\n  - **Action:** Scroll to the bottom of the page.\n  - **Verification:** Confirm that the link to the research paper is visible in the viewport.\n\n- **Step 2:** Identify and click the link to the research paper.\n  - **Action:** Click the link 'The Population of the Galactic Center Filaments: Position Angle Distribution Reveals a Degree-scale Collimated Outflow from Sgr A* along the Galactic Plane'.\n  - **Verification:** Check the URL or the title of the page to confirm that the research paper is open.\n\n- **Step 3:** Read through the research paper, focusing on the acknowledgments section or any part that mentions funding sources.\n  - **Action:** Navigate through the paper and locate the acknowledgments section.\n  - **Verification:** Confirm that the acknowledgments section is found and readable.\n\n- **Step 4:** Extract the NASA award number under which R. G. Arendt's work was supported.\n  - **Action:** Identify and extract the NASA award number from the acknowledgments section.\n  - **Verification:** Confirm the extraction of the correct NASA award number.\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **Scroll to the Bottom:**\n   - Scroll to the bottom of the article to ensure the link is within the viewport.\n\n2. **Identify and Click the Link:**\n   - Click the link 'The Population of the Galactic Center Filaments: Position Angle Distribution Reveals a Degree-scale Collimated Outflow from Sgr A* along the Galactic Plane'.\n   - Verify that the link is clicked and the research paper is open.\n\n3. **Read the Paper:**\n   - Read through the paper, focusing on the acknowledgments section.\n\n4. **Extract the NASA Award Number:**\n   - Identify and extract the NASA award number under which R.

It blew out a huge bi-lobed bubble that blasted through the interstellar medium in two directions. Whatever it was, it released huge amounts of energy from the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A\n (Sgr A for short).\nThese bubbles contain weird, spindly one-dimensional vertical filaments that emit radio signals of their own. In 1984, astronomer Farhad Yusef-Zadeh at Northwestern University and his collaborators were \nthe first to observe these wispy trails. Now, they know of more than a thousand of them. They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

However, these aren't vertical. Instead, they lie along the galactic plane and radiate away like spokes on a wheel. \"It was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole,\" Yusef-Zadeh said. \"We have always been thinking about vertical filaments and their origin. I'm used to them being vertical. I never considered there might be others along the plane.\"\nHe and the team were stunned when they saw these radially stretched structures. \"We had to do a lot of work to establish that we weren't fooling ourselves,\" he said. \"And we found that these filaments are not random but appear to be tied to the outflow of our black hole. By studying them, we could learn more about the black hole's spin and accretion disk orientation. It is satisfying when one finds order in a middle of a chaotic field of the nucleus of our galaxy.\"\nYusef-Zadeh pointed out that something clearly occurred in the core to create the short radial filaments. \"We think they must have originated with some kind of outflow from an activity that happened a few million years ago,\" he said. \"It seems to be the result of an interaction of that outflowing material with objects near it.\"\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Then, it \"burps out\" an energetic, highly magnetized blast of energy and plasma. That seems the most likely explanation for the appearance of the bubbles and filaments. It's possible that such a jet collided with clouds of gas and dust in the immediate neighborhood. It could have led to twisted magnetic structures that form the filaments.\nAnother idea is that molecular gas got stretched by the expansion of the material near the core. That somehow creates the radial filaments. Such action would also explain the lopsided appearance of the Sgr E complex. It lies to one side of the black hole at the intersection of the central molecular zone and a wide central dust lane. Finally, it's also possible that the gravitational potential of our galaxy's central bar is tugging the Sgr E cloud. That could play a role in forming those filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Finally, it's also possible that the gravitational potential of our galaxy's central bar is tugging the Sgr E cloud. That could play a role in forming those filaments.\nThe vertical ones pose a different challenge to understand. They tower up to 150 light-years above the plane of the galaxy. Yusef-Zadeh and his team suggest a couple of ideas for their existence. The first is cosmic-ray pressure forcing filaments into a vertical orientation. That pressure is the aftermath of the explosive event a few million years ago that created the bubbles.\nSome verticals could be the result of the interaction of a large-scale wind in the region and obstacles embedded within the flow. That combination creates filaments by wrapping the wind's magnetic field around the obstacles. Clearly, there's a lot of observation work and analysis to be done in order to really understand what's happening to create both sets of filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

This is where two massive clusters of galaxies have collided. The resulting combined galaxies and other material is now called the Bullet Cluster, after one of the two members that interacted over several billion years. It's one of the hottest-known galaxy clusters, thanks to clouds of gas that were heated by shockwaves during the event. Astronomers have observed this scene with several different telescopes in multiple wavelengths of light, including X-ray and infrared. Those observations and others show that the dark matter makes up the majority of the cluster's mass. Its gravitational effect distorts light from more distant objects and makes it an ideal gravitational lens.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\",\n        \"description\": \"\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Home\",\n        \"og:description\": \"\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.universetoday.com\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Universe Today\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"Home\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"\",\n        \"twitter:site\": \"@universetoday\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://www.universetoday.com/assets/ut-website-logo-100.png\",\n        \"og:image:alt\": \"Universe Today\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://www.universetoday.com/assets/ut-website-logo-100.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

When NASA's DART spacecraft slammed into Dimorphos in 2022 as part of an asteroid redirection test, it altered the asteroids orbit, proving that kinetic impactors can be used to defend Earth from hazardous objects. Unfortunately, the impact also created a shower of boulders that also gave Dimorphos an unpredicted kinetic kick.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\",\n        \"description\": \"\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Home\",\n        \"og:description\": \"\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.universetoday.com\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Universe Today\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"Home\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"\",\n        \"twitter:site\": \"@universetoday\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://www.universetoday.com/assets/ut-website-logo-100.png\",\n        \"og:image:alt\": \"Universe Today\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://www.universetoday.com/assets/ut-website-logo-100.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
