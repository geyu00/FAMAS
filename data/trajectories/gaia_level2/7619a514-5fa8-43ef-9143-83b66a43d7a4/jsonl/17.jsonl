{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when Regression was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The source for this information is GitHub.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when Regression was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - This information can be found on the numpy GitHub repository, specifically in the issues section, filtering for closed issues with the \"Regression\" label and sorting by the oldest.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Once the oldest closed issue with the Regression label is identified, the date when the Regression label was added needs to be extracted from the issue's history or comments.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The numpy project is well-maintained, so the issue tracking system likely has detailed logs and timestamps.\n   - The oldest closed issue with the Regression label might be several years old, given the maturity of the numpy project.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Numpy GitHub Repository URL**: Confirm the URL for the numpy GitHub repository.\n- **Filter and Sort Issues**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to the numpy GitHub repository, filter issues by \"closed\" status, and apply the \"Regression\" label filter. Sort the filtered issues by the oldest first.\n- **Locate the Oldest Issue**: Identify the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Extract the Date**: Use WebSurfer to inspect the issue's history or comments to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Format the Date**: Ensure the date is formatted in MM/DD/YY.\n- **Report the Result**: Provide the formatted date as the final answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and any new insights:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when Regression was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The source for this information is GitHub.\n   - We have successfully navigated to the numpy GitHub repository and filtered the issues to show only closed issues with the 'Regression' label.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when Regression was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - This information can be found on the numpy GitHub repository, specifically in the issues section, filtering for closed issues with the \"Regression\" label and sorting by the oldest.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Once the oldest closed issue with the Regression label is identified, the date when the Regression label was added needs to be extracted from the issue's history or comments.\n   - We need to ensure that the issue is related to `numpy.polynomial` to meet the criteria of the request.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The numpy project is well-maintained, so the issue tracking system likely has detailed logs and timestamps.\n   - The oldest closed issue with the Regression label might be several years old, given the maturity of the numpy project.\n   - The `numpy.polynomial` module is a part of the numpy project, and issues related to it are likely to be well-documented and labeled appropriately.\n   - Sorting the filtered issues by the oldest first will help us identify the oldest closed issue with the Regression label quickly.\n\n**REASONING FOR UPDATED GUESSES:**\n- **Detailed Logs and Timestamps**: Given the well-maintained nature of the numpy project, it is reasonable to assume that the issue tracking system will provide detailed logs and timestamps for when labels were added.\n- **Age of the Oldest Issue**: The numpy project has been around for a long time, and it is common for mature projects to have older issues that have been closed and labeled over the years.\n- **Relevance to `numpy.polynomial`**: Since `numpy.polynomial` is a specific module within the numpy project, issues related to it are likely to be clearly labeled and easy to filter.\n- **Sorting by Oldest First**: Sorting the issues by the oldest first will help us quickly identify the oldest closed issue with the Regression label, which is a crucial step in finding the date when the label was added.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Sort the filtered issues by the oldest first.\n2. Identify the oldest closed issue with the Regression label that is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n3. Extract the date when the Regression label was added to this issue.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetition of Steps**: The previous attempts involved repeatedly clicking the same filters and labels without ensuring that the correct actions were being taken each time.\n- **Lack of Verification**: There was no verification to ensure that the filters and sorting were applied correctly.\n- **Missing Specific Criteria**: The focus on the `numpy.polynomial` module was not explicitly addressed, which is a crucial part of the request.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Numpy GitHub Issues Page**:\n   - Ensure the web browser is open to the numpy GitHub issues page: [Issues · numpy/numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues).\n\n2. **Apply Filters**:\n   - Click on \"Filters\" and select \"Closed\" to show only closed issues.\n   - Click on \"Labels\" and select \"Regression\" to filter issues with the Regression label.\n   - Click on \"Search Issues\" and enter `is:issue is:closed label:Regression` to refine the search.\n\n3. **Sort Issues**:\n   - Click on \"Sort by\" and select \"Oldest\" to sort the issues by the oldest first.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Issues**:\n   - Scroll through the list of issues to find the oldest closed issue that is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n   - Verify that the issue is indeed related to `numpy.polynomial` by checking the issue title and description.\n\n5. **Extract the Date**:\n   - Open the identified issue and scroll through the comments or history to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n   - Note the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n6. **Format the Date**:\n   - Ensure the date is formatted in MM/DD/YY.\n\n7. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the formatted date as the final answer.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Verify Each Step**: After applying each filter or sorting option, verify that the changes have been applied correctly.\n- **Check for Specific Criteria**: Explicitly check that the issue is related to `numpy.polynomial` before proceeding to extract the date.\n- **Use Detailed Inspection**: When extracting the date, carefully inspect the issue's history and comments to ensure accuracy."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and any new insights:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed `numpy.polynomial` issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The source for this information is GitHub.\n   - We have successfully navigated to the numpy GitHub repository and filtered the issues to show only closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n   - The search query 'is:issue is:closed label:Regression' did not return any results, suggesting that either the label \"Regression\" is not used frequently or there are no closed issues with this label related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed `numpy.polynomial` issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - This information can be found on the numpy GitHub repository, specifically in the issues section, filtering for closed issues with the \"Regression\" label and sorting by the oldest.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Once the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is identified, the date when the \"Regression\" label was added needs to be extracted from the issue's history or comments.\n   - We need to ensure that the issue is related to `numpy.polynomial` to meet the criteria of the request.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The numpy project is well-maintained, so the issue tracking system likely has detailed logs and timestamps.\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label might be several years old, given the maturity of the numpy project.\n   - The `numpy.polynomial` module is a part of the numpy project, and issues related to it are likely to be well-documented and labeled appropriately.\n   - Sorting the filtered issues by the oldest first will help us identify the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label quickly.\n   - If the initial search query does not return results, it might be necessary to broaden the search to include all closed issues and manually filter for those related to `numpy.polynomial` and labeled as \"Regression\".\n\n### REASONING FOR UPDATED GUESSES:\n- **Detailed Logs and Timestamps**: Given the well-maintained nature of the numpy project, it is reasonable to assume that the issue tracking system will provide detailed logs and timestamps for when labels were added.\n- **Age of the Oldest Issue**: The numpy project has been around for a long time, and it is common for mature projects to have older issues that have been closed and labeled over the years.\n- **Relevance to `numpy.polynomial`**: Since `numpy.polynomial` is a specific module within the numpy project, issues related to it are likely to be clearly labeled and easy to filter.\n- **Sorting by Oldest First**: Sorting the issues by the oldest first will help us quickly identify the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label, which is a crucial step in finding the date when the label was added.\n- **Broadening the Search**: If the initial search query does not return results, it might be necessary to broaden the search to include all closed issues and manually filter for those related to `numpy.polynomial` and labeled as \"Regression\". This could help us avoid missing relevant issues due to specific label usage.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Broaden the Search**:\n   - Perform a broader search for closed issues related to `numpy.polynomial` without the \"Regression\" label filter.\n   - Manually filter the results to find issues labeled as \"Regression\".\n2. **Sort the Issues**:\n   - Once the relevant issues are identified, sort them by the oldest first.\n3. **Identify the Oldest Issue**:\n   - Identify the oldest closed issue that meets the criteria (related to `numpy.polynomial` and labeled as \"Regression\").\n4. **Extract the Date**:\n   - Open the identified issue and scroll through the comments or history to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n   - Note the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n5. **Format the Date**:\n   - Ensure the date is formatted in MM/DD/YY.\n6. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the formatted date as the final answer.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes:\n- **Verify Each Step**: After applying each filter or sorting option, verify that the changes have been applied correctly.\n- **Check for Specific Criteria**: Explicitly check that the issue is related to `numpy.polynomial` before proceeding to extract the date.\n- **Use Detailed Inspection**: When extracting the date, carefully inspect the issue's history and comments to ensure accuracy.\n- **Broaden the Search if Necessary**: If the initial search does not yield results, broaden the search to include all closed issues and manually filter for the relevant ones.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Filter Application**: The initial search query 'is:issue is:closed label:Regression' did not return any results, suggesting that either the label \"Regression\" is not used frequently or there are no closed issues with this label related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Overly Narrow Search**: The search was too narrow, potentially missing relevant issues because it strictly filtered for the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Lack of Manual Verification**: The search did not include a manual verification step to ensure that all relevant issues were considered, even if they did not strictly match the initial filter.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Perform a Broader Search**:\n   - Use the search query 'is:issue is:closed' to get all closed issues.\n   - Manually filter the results to find issues related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n2. **Apply Additional Filters**:\n   - Once the broader search results are displayed, use the \"Labels\" filter to add the \"Regression\" label.\n   - Ensure that the \"Sort by\" option is set to \"Oldest\" to identify the oldest closed issue.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Issues**:\n   - Scroll through the list of issues to find the oldest closed issue that is related to `numpy.polynomial` and has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - Verify that the issue is indeed related to `numpy.polynomial` by checking the issue title and description.\n\n4. **Extract the Date**:\n   - Open the identified issue and scroll through the comments or history to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n   - Note the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n5. **Format the Date**:\n   - Ensure the date is formatted in MM/DD/YY.\n\n6. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the formatted date as the final answer.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Verify Each Step**: After applying each filter or sorting option, verify that the changes have been applied correctly.\n- **Check for Specific Criteria**: Explicitly check that the issue is related to `numpy.polynomial` before proceeding to extract the date.\n- **Use Detailed Inspection**: When extracting the date, carefully inspect the issue's history and comments to ensure accuracy.\n- **Broaden the Search if Necessary**: If the initial search does not yield results, broaden the search to include all closed issues and manually filter for the relevant ones.\n\n### Action Steps for WebSurfer\n\n1. **Navigate to the Numpy GitHub Issues Page**:\n   - Go to [Issues · numpy/numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues).\n\n2. **Perform a Broader Search**:\n   - Type 'is:issue is:closed' into the 'Search Issues' box.\n\n3. **Apply Additional Filters**:\n   - Click on \"Filters\" and select \"Closed\" to show only closed issues.\n   - Click on \"Labels\" and select \"Regression\" to filter issues with the Regression label.\n   - Click on \"Sort by\" and select \"Oldest\" to sort the issues by the oldest first.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Issues**:\n   - Scroll through the list of issues to find the oldest closed issue that is related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n   - Verify that the issue is indeed related to `numpy.polynomial` by checking the issue title and description.\n\n5. **Extract the Date**:\n   - Open the identified issue and scroll through the comments or history to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n   - Note the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n6. **Format the Date**:\n   - Ensure the date is formatted in MM/DD/YY.\n\n7. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the formatted date as the final answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and any new insights:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed `numpy.polynomial` issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The source for this information is GitHub.\n   - We have successfully navigated to the numpy GitHub repository and filtered the issues to show only closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n   - The search query 'is:issue is:closed label:\"06 - Regression\"' did not return any results directly related to `numpy.polynomial`, suggesting that the label \"Regression\" might be used differently or less frequently for issues related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed `numpy.polynomial` issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - This information can be found on the numpy GitHub repository, specifically in the issues section, filtering for closed issues and manually checking for those related to `numpy.polynomial` and labeled as \"Regression\".\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Once the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is identified, the date when the \"Regression\" label was added needs to be extracted from the issue's history or comments.\n   - We need to ensure that the issue is related to `numpy.polynomial` to meet the criteria of the request.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The numpy project is well-maintained, so the issue tracking system likely has detailed logs and timestamps.\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label might be several years old, given the maturity of the numpy project.\n   - The `numpy.polynomial` module is a part of the numpy project, and issues related to it are likely to be well-documented and labeled appropriately.\n   - Sorting the filtered issues by the oldest first will help us identify the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label quickly.\n   - If the initial search query does not return results, it might be necessary to broaden the search to include all closed issues and manually filter for those related to `numpy.polynomial` and labeled as \"Regression\".\n   - The label \"Regression\" might be used less frequently for `numpy.polynomial` issues, or the issues might be labeled differently.\n\n### REASONING FOR UPDATED GUESSES:\n- **Detailed Logs and Timestamps**: Given the well-maintained nature of the numpy project, it is reasonable to assume that the issue tracking system will provide detailed logs and timestamps for when labels were added.\n- **Age of the Oldest Issue**: The numpy project has been around for a long time, and it is common for mature projects to have older issues that have been closed and labeled over the years.\n- **Relevance to `numpy.polynomial`**: Since `numpy.polynomial` is a specific module within the numpy project, issues related to it are likely to be clearly labeled and easy to filter.\n- **Sorting by Oldest First**: Sorting the issues by the oldest first will help us quickly identify the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label, which is a crucial step in finding the date when the label was added.\n- **Broadening the Search**: If the initial search query does not return results, it might be necessary to broaden the search to include all closed issues and manually filter for those related to `numpy.polynomial` and labeled as \"Regression\". This could help us avoid missing relevant issues due to specific label usage.\n- **Label Usage**: The label \"Regression\" might be used less frequently for `numpy.polynomial` issues, or the issues might be labeled differently, such as with a more specific label like \"Polynomial Regression\".\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Broaden the Search**:\n   - Perform a broader search for closed issues related to `numpy.polynomial` without the \"Regression\" label filter.\n   - Manually filter the results to find issues labeled as \"Regression\".\n2. **Sort the Issues**:\n   - Once the relevant issues are identified, sort them by the oldest first.\n3. **Identify the Oldest Issue**:\n   - Identify the oldest closed issue that meets the criteria (related to `numpy.polynomial` and labeled as \"Regression\").\n4. **Extract the Date**:\n   - Open the identified issue and scroll through the comments or history to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n   - Note the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n5. **Format the Date**:\n   - Ensure the date is formatted in MM/DD/YY.\n6. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the formatted date as the final answer.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes:\n- **Verify Each Step**: After applying each filter or sorting option, verify that the changes have been applied correctly.\n- **Check for Specific Criteria**: Explicitly check that the issue is related to `numpy.polynomial` before proceeding to extract the date.\n- **Use Detailed Inspection**: When extracting the date, carefully inspect the issue's history and comments to ensure accuracy.\n- **Broaden the Search if Necessary**: If the initial search does not yield results, broaden the search to include all closed issues and manually filter for the relevant ones.\n- **Consider Alternative Labels**: If \"Regression\" is not commonly used, consider searching for alternative labels that might be used for similar issues.\n\n### Action Steps for WebSurfer\n\n1. **Perform a Broader Search**:\n   - Use the search query 'is:issue is:closed numpy.polynomial' to get all closed issues related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n   - Manually filter the results to find issues labeled as \"Regression\".\n\n2. **Sort the Issues**:\n   - Once the broader search results are displayed, use the \"Labels\" filter to add the \"Regression\" label.\n   - Ensure that the \"Sort by\" option is set to \"Oldest\" to identify the oldest closed issue.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Issues**:\n   - Scroll through the list of issues to find the oldest closed issue that is related to `numpy.polynomial` and has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - Verify that the issue is indeed related to `numpy.polynomial` by checking the issue title and description.\n\n4. **Extract the Date**:\n   - Open the identified issue and scroll through the comments or history to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n   - Note the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n5. **Format the Date**:\n   - Ensure the date is formatted in MM/DD/YY.\n\n6. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the formatted date as the final answer.\n\nPlease perform the broader search using the query 'is:issue is:closed numpy.polynomial'. Manually filter the results to find issues labeled as \"Regression\". Once you find the issue, open it and look through the comments or history to find the date when the Regression label was added. Note the date and report it back in MM/DD/YY format.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Context Length Limitations**: The web surfer encountered an error due to the context length exceeding the maximum allowed tokens (32768). This indicates that the conversation history or the amount of data being processed is too large.\n- **Ineffective Search Query**: The initial search queries did not yield the desired results, possibly because the \"Regression\" label is not frequently used for `numpy.polynomial` issues or is labeled differently.\n- **Manual Filtering Needed**: Automated filtering alone might not be sufficient; manual inspection of issues is necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Perform a Broader Search**:\n   - Use the search query 'is:issue is:closed numpy.polynomial' to get all closed issues related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n   - Manually filter the results to find issues labeled as \"Regression\".\n\n2. **Sort the Issues**:\n   - Once the broader search results are displayed, use the \"Labels\" filter to add the \"Regression\" label.\n   - Ensure that the \"Sort by\" option is set to \"Oldest\" to identify the oldest closed issue.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Issues**:\n   - Scroll through the list of issues to find the oldest closed issue that is related to `numpy.polynomial` and has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - Verify that the issue is indeed related to `numpy.polynomial` by checking the issue title and description.\n\n4. **Extract the Date**:\n   - Open the identified issue and scroll through the comments or history to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n   - Note the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n5. **Format the Date**:\n   - Ensure the date is formatted in MM/DD/YY.\n\n6. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the formatted date as the final answer.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Reduce Context Length**: Keep the conversation history and data processing minimal to avoid exceeding the token limit.\n- **Manual Verification**: Manually verify the relevance of issues to ensure they are related to `numpy.polynomial` and have the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Step-by-Step Approach**: Break down the process into smaller, manageable steps to ensure each step is completed accurately.\n\n### Action Steps for WebSurfer\n\n1. **Perform a Broader Search**:\n   - Navigate to the numpy GitHub Issues page.\n   - Use the search query 'is:issue is:closed numpy.polynomial'.\n\n2. **Sort the Issues**:\n   - Apply the 'Closed' filter.\n   - Use the \"Labels\" filter to add the \"Regression\" label.\n   - Sort the issues by \"Oldest\".\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Issues**:\n   - Scroll through the list of issues to find the oldest closed issue that is related to `numpy.polynomial` and has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - Verify the issue's relevance by checking the title and description.\n\n4. **Extract the Date**:\n   - Open the identified issue.\n   - Scroll through the comments or history to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n   - Note the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n5. **Format the Date**:\n   - Ensure the date is formatted in MM/DD/YY.\n\n6. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the formatted date as the final answer.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}
