{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expresses distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of the journal (which is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house).\n   - The specific word that was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - The exact context in which the word was used in the article.\n   - The identities of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house (likely from Norse mythology).\n   - The relevance of the word in the context of dragon depictions in literature or media.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The journal is likely named after Fafnir, one of Hreidmar's sons who is known for transforming into a dragon in Norse mythology.\n   - The word in question might be something like \"cliché,\" \"stereotypical,\" or \"overdone,\" given the context of expressing distaste for common dragon depictions.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Journal Name**: Use knowledge of Norse mythology to identify the son of Hreidmar who guarded his house, which will help determine the name of the journal.\n- **Web Search for the Article**: Use WebSurfer to search for Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the identified journal.\n- **Locate the Specific Word**: Once the article is found, use WebSurfer to read through the article and locate the word that was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n- **Verify the Context**: Ensure that the word is indeed used in the context of expressing distaste for dragon depictions and is quoted from two different authors.\n- **Report the Findings**: Compile the information and report back with the name of the journal, the specific word, and the context in which it was used."}

This   disconnect   with   traditional\ndragons   has   been   bemoaned   as   ruining   the   mythic   and   archetypal   power   of\ndragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than\nreadily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore:\nthe eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore,\nfrom which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary\nbeasts,   but   they   also   created   a   distinctly   unsettling   atmosphere   in   their   stories.\nModern   tamed   and   human-like   children’s   literature   dragons   borrow   certain\nuncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not\nalways   life-threatening   characters.   In   specific,   two   traits   borrowed   from   the\noriginal lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’\nintensely   possessive   gaze   and   their   clever,   manipulative   speech.   This   article\nanalyzes   these  Freudian   inheritances   to   argue   that   children’s   literature   dragons\nhave   not   been   entirely   softened   and   satirized;   the   potential   for   uncanny   fear\nembodied by  the human-like  behaviors  of legendary Western dragons  lingers  in\nmany modern children’s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are\nstill   strong   characters   and   can   and   should   be   analyzed   productively   through   a\nFreudian uncanny lens.\n\nKeywords: Dragon, uncanny, Freud, children’s literature\n\nBiography and contact info: Emily Midkiff (MA, English and Children's Literature) is teaching and\nworking on her PhD at the University of Minnesota.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien once declared that “the dragon in legend is a potent creation of men’s imagination,\nricher in significance than his barrow is in gold” (“The Monsters” 16). Dragons in mythology have\ncome   to   be   recognized   for   their   value   as   representations   of   ancient   cultures   or   as   worldwide\narchetypes. Anthropologists have found and studied dragons in nearly all surviving mythologies;\nmedievalists have examined them in manuscripts and bestiaries. In modern literature, dragons have\nflourished in their newer realm of fantasy and children’s literature as one of its most pervasive\nmythic animals.\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n41\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nThe Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature\n\nYet   within   children’s   literature,   scholars   have   noted   a   trend   beginning   even   before   the\ndragon’s mass popularity in fantasy to soften and satirize the dragon for children. While this type of\nfriendly dragon has become a well known resident of children’s  books, this  article argues that\nchildren’s literature dragons have been not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for\nuncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many\nmodern children’s literature dragons.\n\nFluffy Dragons\n\nIn comparison to ancient dragon lore, modern dragons for children inspire less terror and more\nlaughter, beginning most noticeably with Kenneth Grahame’s “The Reluctant Dragon” in 1898.\nRuth Stein in 1968 and Margaret Blount in 1974 both comment with distaste on the increasingly\ncuddly,   “fluffy”   nature   of   dragons   in   children’s   literature.   In   a   short   article   for  Elementary\nEducation,   Stein   expresses   hope   that   Tolkien’s   Smaug   would   improve   the   literary   dragon’s\nevolution   and  encourage   properly   scary   dragons.  While   this   has   since   proved  true   in  part,   the\nbemoaned   fluffy   dragons   remain   prevalent   alongside   Tolkien’s   menacing   breed.   Nonetheless\nBlount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they\ncould be less than terrifying and still remain “real dragons” (129). She points out several stories that\nfail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally\nbehave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in\norder to inspire conflict. Jon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a “real” dragon is and\neven praises the proliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame’s dragon, as parodies of the\noutdated cultural codes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223).\n\nHope Shastri’s 1992 dissertation on the picture book dragon gives concrete results to support\nthe observations of scholars like Stein, Blount, and Stott. Shastri performed a content analysis of\n151 picture books produced between 1950 and 1992 in order to ascertain"}
