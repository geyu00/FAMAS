The error message indicates that there is no module named 'functions', which suggests that the script is trying to import a function that is not available.\n\nTo resolve this, I will modify the code to include a direct implementation of a PDF text extraction function using the `PyPDF2` library.

Install `PyPDF2` to ensure we have the necessary library for PDF text extraction.\n2.

{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "It seems the execution of the PDF text extraction script did not yield any output and returned an error again. This indicates there may still be an issue with either the module import or the PDF file itself.\n\nTo troubleshoot further, let's take a different approach. We will:\n1. Reconfirm the presence of the PDF file.\n2. Use a simpler text extraction method that does not rely on external libraries to ensure we can retrieve the text from the PDF.\n\nFor this, I'll utilize the `pdf2text` shell command that can convert PDF files to text. Let's execute a command that checks the availability of `pdf2text` and then extract the text from the PDF.\n\nHere is the shell command for extracting text:\n\n```sh\n# Check if 'pdf2text' is available and then extract text from the PDF\npdf2text ../2023/validation/Job Listing.pdf extracted_text.txt\n```\n\nIf the command executes successfully, the content of the PDF will be in the `extracted_text.txt` file, and we can read that file afterward for analysis.

In this case, let's revert to using Python to extract text from the PDF file using an alternative approach with the `PyMuPDF` (also known as `fitz`) library, which can often extract text from PDFs more reliably.\n\nFirst, we will install `PyMuPDF` and then create a script to extract text from the PDF file.\n\nHere's the command to install `PyMuPDF`:\n\n```sh\npip install PyMuPDF\n```\n\nAnd hereâ€™s the updated extraction code using `PyMuPDF`:\n\n```python\n# filename: extract_pdf_text.py\nimport fitz  # PyMuPDF\n\npdf_path = '../2023/validation/Job Listing.pdf'\nextracted_text = \"\"\n\n# Open the PDF file\nwith fitz.open(pdf_path) as doc:\n    for page in doc:\n        extracted_text += page.get_text()\n\nprint(extracted_text)\n```\n\nLet's execute the installation command and the updated extraction code."}
