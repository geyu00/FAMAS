There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - The paper included a diagram of an X-ray time profile.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors published in July 2020.\n   - The user is specifically asking for the difference in seconds between the measured time spans of the two diagrams.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact measured time span of the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact measured time span of the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - Both papers are available on Arxiv, and the specific diagrams can be found within these papers.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans, which can be calculated once the exact time spans are known.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The difference in seconds is likely to be a small number, as both papers are discussing similar phenomena and are authored by the same researchers.\n   - The time spans could be on the order of milliseconds to seconds, given the nature of fast radio bursts.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to locate and open the March 2021 paper on Arxiv.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to locate and open the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.\n- **Step 3:** Use WebSurfer to find and extract the measured time span of the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n- **Step 4:** Use WebSurfer to find and extract the measured time span of the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n- **Step 5:** Calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n- **Step 6:** Provide the final answer to the user."}

The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide.

Dedicated instrumentation could be one of the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks to be the only viable strategy.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - The paper included a diagram of an X-ray time profile.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors published in July 2020.\n   - The user is specifically asking for the difference in seconds between the measured time spans of the two diagrams.\n   - The March 2021 paper is titled \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\" and is available on Arxiv at [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact measured time span of the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact measured time span of the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - The title and Arxiv link for the July 2020 paper.\n   - Both papers are available on Arxiv, and the specific diagrams can be found within these papers.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans, which can be calculated once the exact time spans are known.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The difference in seconds is likely to be a small number, as both papers are discussing similar phenomena and are authored by the same researchers.\n   - The time spans could be on the order of milliseconds to seconds, given the nature of fast radio bursts.\n   - The X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper is likely to be detailed in the results or discussion sections, often accompanied by specific measurements and time scales.\n   - The July 2020 paper might be titled similarly, focusing on multiwavelength observations or fast radio bursts, and could be found by searching for the author names and the topic.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Small Number Difference**: Given that both papers are authored by the same researchers and discuss similar phenomena, it is reasonable to assume that the time spans measured are likely to be close in value, hence the difference should be small.\n- **Time Span Order**: Fast radio bursts are known for their rapid nature, often lasting only milliseconds to a few seconds. Therefore, the time spans in the diagrams are likely to fall within this range.\n- **Detailed Results Section**: Scientific papers typically detail their findings in the results or discussion sections, including specific measurements and time scales. This is a common practice and can help us locate the required information.\n- **Similar Title and Author Search**: Since the papers are from the same authors and cover a similar topic, using the author names and keywords related to fast radio bursts and multiwavelength observations should help locate the July 2020 paper.\n\nNext steps:\n1. **Locate the X-ray Time Profile in the March 2021 Paper**: Open the PDF of the March 2021 paper and find the X-ray time profile diagram. Extract the measured time span in seconds.\n2. **Find the July 2020 Paper**: Use the author names and keywords to locate the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.\n3. **Extract the Measured Time Span from the July 2020 Paper**: Once the July 2020 paper is found, locate the burst-1 diagram and extract the measured time span in seconds.\n4. **Calculate the Difference**: Subtract the time span from the July 2020 paper from the time span in the March 2021 paper to get the difference in seconds.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inability to Directly Interact with PDFs**: The current tools (WebSurfer, FileSurfer, ComputerTerminal) do not have the capability to directly extract text or images from PDFs.

Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks to be the only viable strategy. Additionally, small/medium size radiotelescopes co-pointing higher energies telescopes look a very interesting and cheap complementary observational strategy. \nComments:\n44 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication on Universe\nSubjects:\nHigh Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)Cite as:\narXiv:2103.07786 [astro-ph.HE] \n(or \narXiv:2103.07786v2 [astro-ph.HE] for this version) \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2103.07786\nFocus to learn more\nJournal reference:\nUniverse 2021, 7, 76\nRelated DOI: \nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/universe7030076\nFocus to learn more\nSubmission history\n From: Luciano Nicastro Dr. [\nview email] \n[v1] Sat, 13 Mar 2021 20:39:49 UTC (14,577 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 25 Mar 2021 10:44:14 UTC (1,195 KB)\nAccess Paper:\nView PDFTeX SourceOther Formatsview license Current browse context: \nastro-ph.HE\n< prev  |  \nnext >new \n | recent \n | 2021-03 Change to browse by: \nastro-phReferences & Citations\nINSPIRE HEPNASA ADSGoogle ScholarSemantic Scholarexport BibTeX citation\nBookmark\n Bibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer \nCode, Data, Media\nDemos\nRelated Papers\n About arXivLabs\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"msapplication-TileColor\": \"#da532c\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"description\": \"Abstract page for arXiv paper 2103.07786: Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"arXiv.org\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786v2\",\n        \"og:image\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:secure_url\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"1200\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"700\",\n        \"og:image:alt\": \"arXiv logo\",\n        \"og:description\": \"The origin and phenomenology of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) remains unknown despite more than a decade of efforts.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n- The paper included a diagram of an X-ray time profile.\n- There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors published in July 2020.\n- The user is specifically asking for the difference in seconds between the measured time spans of the two diagrams.\n- The March 2021 paper is titled \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\" and is available on Arxiv at [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786).\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The exact measured time span of the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n- The exact measured time span of the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n- The title and Arxiv link for the July 2020 paper.\n- Both papers are available on Arxiv, and the specific diagrams can be found within these papers.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans, which can be calculated once the exact time spans are known.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Small Number Difference**: Given that both papers are authored by the same researchers and discuss similar phenomena, it is reasonable to assume that the time spans measured are likely to be close in value, hence the difference should be small.\n- **Time Span Order**: Fast radio bursts are known for their rapid nature, often lasting only milliseconds to a few seconds. Therefore, the time spans in the diagrams are likely to fall within this range.\n- **Detailed Results Section**: Scientific papers typically detail their findings in the results or discussion sections, including specific measurements and time scales. This is a common practice and can help us locate the required information.\n- **Similar Title and Author Search**: Since the papers are from the same authors and cover a similar topic, using the author names and keywords related to fast radio bursts and multiwavelength observations should help locate the July 2020 paper.\n- **Common Authors**: The authors of the March 2021 paper include Luciano Nicastro, Cristiano Guidorzi, Eliana Palazzi, Luca Zampieri, Massimo Turatto, and Angela Gardini. One or more of these authors are likely to be involved in the July 2020 paper as well.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Small Number Difference**: Given that both papers are authored by the same researchers and discuss similar phenomena, it is reasonable to assume that the time spans measured are likely to be close in value, hence the difference should be small.\n- **Time Span Order**: Fast radio bursts are known for their rapid nature, often lasting only milliseconds to a few seconds. Therefore, the time spans in the diagrams are likely to fall within this range.\n- **Detailed Results Section**: Scientific papers typically detail their findings in the results or discussion sections, including specific measurements and time scales. This is a common practice and can help us locate the required information.\n- **Similar Title and Author Search**: Since the papers are from the same authors and cover a similar topic, using the author names and keywords related to fast radio bursts and multiwavelength observations should help locate the July 2020 paper.\n- **Common Authors**: Identifying common authors can help narrow down the search for the July 2020 paper, as they are likely to have published similar work.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Locate the X-ray Time Profile in the March 2021 Paper**:\n   - Open the PDF of the March 2021 paper and search for 'X-ray time profile' or 'X-ray diagram'.\n   - Extract the measured time span in seconds from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n\n2. **Find the July 2020 Paper**:\n   - Use the author names (Luciano Nicastro, Cristiano Guidorzi, Eliana Palazzi, Luca Zampieri, Massimo Turatto, Angela Gardini) and keywords (multiwavelength observations, fast radio bursts) to locate the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.\n   - Open the paper and search for 'burst-1 diagram' or 'burst-1 time profile'.\n   - Extract the measured time span in seconds from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Subtract the time span from the July 2020 paper from the time span in the March 2021 paper to get the difference in seconds.\n\n4. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Provide the final answer to the user.\n\n### Action Items\n1. **WebSurfer**: Open the March 2021 paper on Arxiv at [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786).\n2. **WebSurfer**: Click on 'View PDF' to download the PDF.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Open the PDF and search for 'X-ray time profile' or 'X-ray diagram'.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Extract the measured time span in seconds from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the author names and keywords to find the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.\n6. **WebSurfer**: Open the July 2020 paper and search for 'burst-1 diagram' or 'burst-1 time profile'.\n7. **WebSurfer**: Extract the measured time span in seconds from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n8. **Assistant**: Calculate the difference in seconds and provide the final answer to the user.\n\nLet's proceed with the first action item:\n\n**WebSurfer**: Open the March 2021 paper on Arxiv at [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786).\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inability to Directly Interact with PDFs**: The current tools (WebSurfer, FileSurfer, ComputerTerminal) do not have the capability to directly extract text or images from PDFs. This led to repeated attempts to navigate through the PDF without success.\n2. **Lack of Specific Information Extraction**: Even when the PDF was opened, the specific information (measured time span in seconds) was not extracted due to the lack of direct interaction capabilities with PDFs.\n3. **Repetition of Steps**: The process of opening the PDF and navigating through it was repeated without making progress because the root issue (inability to extract specific information from PDFs) was not addressed.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Locate the X-ray Time Profile in the March 2021 Paper**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the March 2021 paper on Arxiv at [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on 'View PDF' to download the PDF.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the PDF and search for 'X-ray time profile' or 'X-ray diagram'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the relevant section and extract the measured time span in seconds from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n\n2. **Find the July 2020 Paper**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the author names (Luciano Nicastro, Cristiano Guidorzi, Eliana Palazzi, Luca Zampieri, Massimo Turatto, Angela Gardini) and keywords (multiwavelength observations, fast radio bursts, July 2020).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on 'View PDF' to download the PDF.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the PDF and search for 'burst-1 diagram' or 'burst-1 time profile'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the relevant section and extract the measured time span in seconds from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - **Assistant**: Once both time spans are provided, subtract the time span from the July 2020 paper from the time span in the March 2021 paper to get the difference in seconds.\n\n4. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final answer to the user.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Locate the X-ray Time Profile in the March 2021 Paper**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the March 2021 paper on Arxiv at [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on 'View PDF' to download the PDF.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the PDF and search for 'X-ray time profile' or 'X-ray diagram'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the relevant section and extract the measured time span in seconds from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n\n2. **Find the July 2020 Paper**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query \"Luciano Nicastro multiwavelength observations fast radio bursts July 2020\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on 'View PDF' to download the PDF.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the PDF and search for 'burst-1 diagram' or 'burst-1 time profile'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the relevant section and extract the measured time span in seconds from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - **Assistant**: Once both time spans are provided, subtract the time span from the July 2020 paper from the time span in the March 2021 paper to get the difference in seconds.\n\n4. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final answer to the user.\n\n### Action Items\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Open the March 2021 paper on Arxiv at [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786).\n2. **WebSurfer**: Click on 'View PDF' to download the PDF.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Open the PDF and search for 'X-ray time profile' or 'X-ray diagram'.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the relevant section and extract the measured time span in seconds from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query \"Luciano Nicastro multiwavelength observations fast radio bursts July 2020\".\n6. **WebSurfer**: Open the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.\n7. **WebSurfer**: Click on 'View PDF' to download the PDF.\n8. **WebSurfer**: Open the PDF and search for 'burst-1 diagram' or 'burst-1 time profile'.\n9. **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the relevant section and extract the measured time span in seconds from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n10. **Assistant**: Calculate the difference in seconds and provide the final answer to the user.\n\nLet's start with the first action item:\n\n**WebSurfer**: Open the March 2021 paper on Arxiv at [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786)."}

Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them.

Additionally, small/medium size radiotelescopes co-pointing higher energies telescopes look a very interesting and cheap complementary observational strategy. \nComments:\n44 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication on Universe\nSubjects:\nHigh Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)Cite as:\narXiv:2103.07786 [astro-ph.HE] \n(or \narXiv:2103.07786v2 [astro-ph.HE] for this version) \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2103.07786\nFocus to learn more\nJournal reference:\nUniverse 2021, 7, 76\nRelated DOI: \nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/universe7030076\nFocus to learn more\nSubmission history\n From: Luciano Nicastro Dr. [\nview email] \n[v1] Sat, 13 Mar 2021 20:39:49 UTC (14,577 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 25 Mar 2021 10:44:14 UTC (1,195 KB)\nAccess Paper:\nView PDFTeX SourceOther Formatsview license Current browse context: \nastro-ph.HE\n< prev  |  \nnext >new \n | recent \n | 2021-03 Change to browse by: \nastro-phReferences & Citations\nINSPIRE HEPNASA ADSGoogle ScholarSemantic Scholarexport BibTeX citation\nBookmark\n Bibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer \nCode, Data, Media\nDemos\nRelated Papers\n About arXivLabs\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"msapplication-TileColor\": \"#da532c\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"description\": \"Abstract page for arXiv paper 2103.07786: Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"arXiv.org\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786v2\",\n        \"og:image\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:secure_url\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"1200\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"700\",\n        \"og:image:alt\": \"arXiv logo\",\n        \"og:description\": \"The origin and phenomenology of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) remains unknown despite more than a decade of efforts.
