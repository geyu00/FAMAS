I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\".

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The language of Tizin uses a VOS (Verb-Object-Subject) word order.\n   - The word for oneself in Tizin: Nominative form is \"Pa\", Accusative form is \"Mato\", Genitive form is \"Sing\".\n   - The root verb \"Maktay\" means an intense like for something and translates better as \"is pleasing to\".\n   - \"Maktay\" is used in its root form in the present tense, \"Tay\" in the preterit past, and \"Aktay\" in the imperfect past.\n   - The word for apples in Tizin: Nominative form is \"Apple\", Accusative form is \"Zapple\", Genitive form is \"Izapple\".\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - No specific facts need to be looked up as all necessary information is provided in the request.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The correct translation of \"I like apples\" into Tizin, considering the given grammatical rules and word forms.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the provided information, the sentence \"I like apples\" can be translated into Tizin as \"Maktay Zapple Pa\" (Verb-Object-Subject structure). However, since \"Maktay\" translates as \"is pleasing to,\" the sentence more accurately reflects \"Apples are pleasing to me.\"\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Confirm the sentence structure and verb conjugation rules for Tizin based on the given information.\n- Translate \"I like apples\" into Tizin using the VOS (Verb-Object-Subject) structure.\n- Verify the translation by ensuring it aligns with the provided grammatical rules and word forms.\n- Provide the final translated sentence.\n\nSince the necessary information is already provided and no additional research or computation is required, the team members' specific skills (like Python scripting, file handling, or web browsing) are not needed for this task. The translation can be completed directly based on the given facts."}
