The bar must be wheelchair accessible.\n   - The bar should be the closest to the Mummers Museum.\n   - The exact address of the Mummers Museum is 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of bars near the Mummers Museum.\n   - Information on the wheelchair accessibility of these bars.\n   - The distances from the Mummers Museum to each of these bars.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Google Maps for addresses and distances, Yelp or the bars' websites for wheelchair accessibility information, and local tourism websites for additional details.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The closest bar to the Mummers Museum based on the distances obtained.\n   - Confirmation that the closest bar is indeed wheelchair accessible.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Mummers Museum is likely located in an area with several bars, given its location in Philadelphia.\n   - Popular tourist areas in Philadelphia often have establishments that cater to accessibility needs, including wheelchair access.\n   - Based on the search results, some of the nearby bars include:\n     - 12 Steps Down: Located at 831 Christian St, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n     - The Pub on Passyunk East: Located at 1501 E Passyunk Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n     - Dirty Franks: Located at 1211 S 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n     -

**Step 7**: Check the wheelchair accessibility of each bar using their websites or Yelp reviews.\n\n4. **Identify the Closest and Accessible Bar**:\n   - **Step 8**: Determine the closest bar to the Mummers Museum.\n   - **Step 9**: Confirm that the closest bar is wheelchair accessible.\n\n5. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - **Step 10**: Provide the name and address of the closest, wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Search for 12 Steps Down**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"12 Steps Down address and wheelchair accessibility\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the address and wheelchair accessibility information.\n\n2. **Search for The Pub on Passyunk East**:\n   -
