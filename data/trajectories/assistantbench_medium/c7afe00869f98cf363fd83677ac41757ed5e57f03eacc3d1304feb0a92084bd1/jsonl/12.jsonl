Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The actor in question is Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific IMDB ratings for Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The current availability of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which of Daniel Craig's movies meet all the criteria: highest IMDB rating, less than 150 minutes, and available on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, \"Skyfall\" and \"No Time to Die\" are highly rated James Bond films starring Daniel Craig, but their runtimes and current availability on Netflix (US) need to be verified.\n   - \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is another well-regarded film starring Daniel Craig, and its runtime and availability should also be checked.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for a list of Daniel Craig's movies along with their IMDB ratings and runtimes.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to check the current availability of these movies on Netflix (US).\n- **Step 3:** Filter the results to find movies that are less than 150 minutes and available on Netflix (US).\n- **Step 4:** Identify the movie with the highest IMDB rating from the filtered list.\n- **Step 5:** Verify the final selection and provide the answer."}

The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2012) His turn as Mikael Blomkovist totally blew my mind and exceeded expectations. Everything he did as Mikael seemed so effortless and brutally sincere.\n2. Skyfall (2012) There it is. Finally, his role as James Bond features! I decided to write about his portrayal in ‘Skayfall’, despite the other roles being on almost par with this one.\n3. Munich (2006) This for me was his breakout role. Playing a South African Jewish driver Steve, Craig left all bare, and showed us colors of his personality, we thought he wasn’t capable of portraying.\n4. Defiance (2008) During WWII, in Nazi-Occupied Eastern Europe, the three Bielski brothers escape to the Belarussian forests along with many other Jews in order to survive.\n5. Road to Perdition (2002) The movie saw Craig play the character of Connor Rooney, a merciless hooligan, son of the Irish mob boss John Rooney. The former is envious and has a loathsome attitude towards Michael Sullivan, the mob’s enforcer, and John’s adopted son (kind of).\nDid Daniel Craig & Harrison Ford make a sci-fi western?\nSuch was the case with \nJon Favreau’s sci-fi Western, starring stars of two of the biggest franchises around.
