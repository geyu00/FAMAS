{"agent": "Budgeting_Expert", "content": "Let's calculate the total cost for daily tickets and annual passes step-by-step to verify the accuracy:\n\n### Step 1: Total Cost for Daily Tickets\n\n1. For Adults:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for 2 adults for 4 visits} = 2 \\times \\$20.00 \\times 4 = \\$160.00\n   \\]\n\n2. For Child (age 5):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for 1 child aged 5 for 4 visits} = 1 \\times \\$18.00 \\times 4 = \\$72.00\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total cost for daily tickets for the family for 4 visits:\n\\[\n\\text{Total daily tickets cost} = \\$160.00 + \\$72.00 = \\$232.00\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total Cost for Annual Passes\n\n1.
