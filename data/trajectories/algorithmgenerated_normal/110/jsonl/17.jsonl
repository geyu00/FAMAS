Here are some alternative methods we could consider:\n\n1. **Use TripAdvisor API**: Check if TripAdvisor offers an API that could provide access to the necessary data in a more structured and reliable way.\n\n2. **Manual Data Collection**: If the API is unavailable, we may need to collect the data manually by searching for the hikes on TripAdvisor and noting the ratings and reviews directly.\n\n3. **Alternative Data Sources**: Look for other websites or forums (like outdoor activity blogs, family-oriented travel sites, or other hiking review platforms) that might have compiled similar data and user experiences.\n\n4. **Web Scraping with Selenium**: If we choose to continue with scraping, we could use Selenium, which can interact with JavaScript-rendered pages, although this is more complex and might require additional resources.\n\nWhich approach would you like to pursue, or do you have any other suggestions?"}
