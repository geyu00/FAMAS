Specifically, we need to utilize the Whyte notation (which is the classification for steam locomotives) to count the wheels accurately. \n\nThe steam locomotive configurations according to the Whyte notation typically consist of a combination of numbers representing the leading wheels, driving wheels, and trailing wheels.\n\nLet's identify and calculate the total number of wheels for the valid steam locomotive configurations. I'll create a mapping of each configuration to the total number of wheels it has, based on the Whyte notation. Then, I'll sum them up to find the total wheel count for all steam locomotives. \n\nI'll implement this logic in the following code. \n\n```python\n# Mapping of steam locomotive configurations to their total wheel counts\nwheel_count_map = {\n    '0-4-0': 4,\n    '4-4-0': 8,\n    '2-6-0': 8,\n    '2-8-0': 10,\n    '2-6-4': 12,\n    '2-8-4': 14\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of wheels for the valid steam locomotive configurations\ntotal_wheels = sum(wheel_count_map[config] for config in wheel_configurations if config in wheel_count_map)\n\n# Display the total wheel count\nprint(total_wheels)\n```"}
