{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds.\n   - The transaction fees for the fund in question are $0.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - The goal is to find the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of all Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) for each of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each relevant fund over the specified period.\n   - The fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculated values.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Emerging markets equity funds generally have higher volatility compared to more stable markets, which could affect the percentage increase.\n   - Funds with lower management fees or those that are passively managed might have different performance characteristics compared to actively managed funds.\n   - The global economic conditions and specific regional events during the period from May 2019 to May 2024 could have influenced the performance of these funds.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify Relevant Fidelity Funds**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Fidelity's official website and identify all international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n  \n- **Collect Performance Data**\n  - Use WebSurfer to gather the performance data (percentage increase) for each identified fund from May 2019 to May 2024.\n  \n- **Organize and Analyze Data**\n  - Use Assistant to organize the collected data into a structured format (e.g., a table or list).\n  - Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each fund over the specified period.\n  - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n- **Verify and Report**\n  - Use Assistant to verify the calculations and ensure accuracy.\n  - Prepare a final report identifying the fund with the lowest percentage increase and provide the relevant data."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser.

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds.\n- The transaction fees for the fund in question are $0.\n- The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- The goal is to find the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n- Fidelity offers several international emerging markets equity mutual funds, including the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD and the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX).\n- These funds aim to achieve high total investment returns by investing primarily in equity securities of companies in emerging market countries like Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.\n- The funds have experienced varying levels of volatility due to the nature of emerging markets, and some use financial derivatives to manage risk.\n- The Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) has an expense ratio of 0.07 percent and is rated as having average risk compared to funds in the same category according to Morningstar.\n- Fidelity has rated the volatility of the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund as medium to high.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- A comprehensive list of all Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n- The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) for each of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- Detailed performance data, dividend histories, and prospectuses for further investor information.\n- These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The percentage increase for each relevant fund over the specified period.\n- The fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculated values.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Emerging markets equity funds generally have higher volatility compared to more stable markets, which could affect the percentage increase.**\n  - Reasoning: Emerging markets are often less developed and more susceptible to economic and political instability, leading to higher volatility in fund performance.\n- **Funds with lower management fees or those that are passively managed might have different performance characteristics compared to actively managed funds.**\n  - Reasoning: Lower management fees can reduce the overall cost of investing, potentially leading to better net returns. Passively managed funds tend to track indices and may have more consistent but lower returns compared to actively managed funds.\n- **The global economic conditions and specific regional events during the period from May 2019 to May 2024 could have influenced the performance of these funds.**\n  - Reasoning: Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, trade wars, and geopolitical tensions can significantly impact market performance.\n- **Given the volatility of emerging markets, some funds might have underperformed due to significant economic or political events in specific regions.**\n  - Reasoning: Regional events, such as political instability or economic crises, can disproportionately affect the performance of funds focused on those regions.\n- **Fidelity's use of financial derivatives to manage risk might have affected the performance of some funds, potentially leading to lower percentage increases in volatile periods.**\n  - Reasoning: Derivatives can be used to hedge against market risks, which might dampen the potential for high returns but also protect against significant losses.\n- **The performance of index funds versus actively managed funds in emerging markets might differ, with index funds potentially showing more consistent but lower returns.**\n  - Reasoning: Index funds aim to replicate the performance of a specific index, leading to more predictable but potentially lower returns compared to actively managed funds that aim to outperform the market.\n- **The Fidelity Emerging Markets Index Fund (FPADX) might have lower percentage increases due to its passive management approach and lower expense ratio.**\n  - Reasoning: Passive management typically results in lower fees and more consistent performance, but it may not capture the high returns that active management can sometimes achieve.\n- **The Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD might have higher volatility and potentially higher or lower returns depending on the specific market conditions.**\n  - Reasoning: Actively managed funds can take advantage of market opportunities and mitigate risks, but they are also more susceptible to the manager's decisions and market fluctuations.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n1. **Identify Relevant Fidelity Funds**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Fidelity's official website and identify all international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   \n2. **Collect Performance Data**\n   - Use WebSurfer to gather the performance data (percentage increase) for each identified fund from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   \n3. **Organize and Analyze Data**\n   - Use Assistant to organize the collected data into a structured format (e.g., a table or list).\n   - Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each fund over the specified period.\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   \n4. **Verify and Report**\n   - Use Assistant to verify the calculations and ensure accuracy.\n   - Prepare a final report identifying the fund with the lowest percentage increase and provide the relevant data.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Use Google for Search**\n   - Use WebSurfer to search for \"Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024\" on Google.\n   \n2. **Navigate to Fidelity's Website**\n   - If the search results do not provide direct links, navigate to Fidelity's official website.\n   - Search for the list of international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   \n3. **Collect Performance Data**\n   - For each identified fund, collect the performance data (percentage increase) from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - If necessary, navigate to detailed fund pages or use the search function on Fidelity's website to find the required data.\n   \n4. **Verify and Organize Data**\n   - Use Assistant to organize the collected data into a structured format (e.g., a table or list).\n   - Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each fund over the specified period.\n   \n5. **Identify the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase**\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculated values.\n   - Prepare a final report with the relevant data.\n\nLet's start with the first step.

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds.\n- The transaction fees for the fund in question are $0.\n- The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- The goal is to find the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n- Fidelity offers several international emerging markets equity mutual funds, including the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD and the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX).\n- These funds aim to achieve high total investment returns by investing primarily in equity securities of companies in emerging market countries like Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.\n- The funds have experienced varying levels of volatility due to the nature of emerging markets, and some use financial derivatives to manage risk.\n- The Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) has an expense ratio of 0.07 percent and is rated as having average risk compared to funds in the same category according to Morningstar.\n- Fidelity has rated the volatility of the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund as medium to high.\n- We have encountered network issues and CAPTCHA blocks when attempting to access Fidelity's and Google's websites using the current network connection.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- A comprehensive list of all Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n- The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) for each of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- Detailed performance data, dividend histories, and prospectuses for further investor information.\n- These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The percentage increase for each relevant fund over the specified period.\n- The fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculated values.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Emerging markets equity funds generally have higher volatility compared to more stable markets, which could affect the percentage increase.**\n  - Reasoning: Emerging markets are often less developed and more susceptible to economic and political instability, leading to higher volatility in fund performance.\n- **Funds with lower management fees or those that are passively managed might have different performance characteristics compared to actively managed funds.**\n  - Reasoning: Lower management fees can reduce the overall cost of investing, potentially leading to better net returns.

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds.\n- The transaction fees for the fund in question are $0.\n- The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- The goal is to find the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n- Fidelity offers several international emerging markets equity mutual funds, including the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD and the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX).\n- These funds aim to achieve high total investment returns by investing primarily in equity securities of companies in emerging market countries like Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.\n- The funds have experienced varying levels of volatility due to the nature of emerging markets, and some use financial derivatives to manage risk.\n- The Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) has an expense ratio of 0.07 percent and is rated as having average risk compared to funds in the same category according to Morningstar.\n- Fidelity has rated the volatility of the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund as medium to high.\n- We have encountered network issues and CAPTCHA blocks when attempting to access Fidelity's and Google's websites using the current network connection.\n- Navigating to Fidelity's official website directly has resulted in HTTP2 protocol errors, indicating a network issue.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- A comprehensive list of all Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n- The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) for each of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- Detailed performance data, dividend histories, and prospectuses for further investor information.\n- These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The percentage increase for each relevant fund over the specified period.\n- The fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculated values.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Emerging markets equity funds generally have higher volatility compared to more stable markets, which could affect the percentage increase.**\n  - Reasoning: Emerging markets are often less developed and more susceptible to economic and political instability, leading to higher volatility in fund performance.\n- **Funds with lower management fees or those that are passively managed might have different performance characteristics compared to actively managed funds.**\n  - Reasoning: Lower management fees can reduce the overall cost of investing, potentially leading to better net returns. Passively managed funds tend to track indices and may have more consistent but lower returns compared to actively managed funds.\n- **The global economic conditions and specific regional events during the period from May 2019 to May 2024 could have influenced the performance of these funds.**\n  - Reasoning: Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, trade wars, and geopolitical tensions can significantly impact market performance.\n- **Given the volatility of emerging markets, some funds might have underperformed due to significant economic or political events in specific regions.**\n  - Reasoning: Regional events, such as political instability or economic crises, can disproportionately affect the performance of funds focused on those regions.\n- **Fidelity's use of financial derivatives to manage risk might have affected the performance of some funds, potentially leading to lower percentage increases in volatile periods.**\n  - Reasoning: Derivatives can be used to hedge against market risks, which might dampen the potential for high returns but also protect against significant losses.\n- **The performance of index funds versus actively managed funds in emerging markets might differ, with index funds potentially showing more consistent but lower returns.**\n  - Reasoning: Index funds aim to replicate the performance of a specific index, leading to more predictable but potentially lower returns compared to actively managed funds that aim to outperform the market.\n- **The Fidelity Emerging Markets Index Fund (FPADX) might have lower percentage increases due to its passive management approach and lower expense ratio.**\n  - Reasoning: Passive management typically results in lower fees and more consistent performance, but it may not capture the high returns that active management can sometimes achieve.\n- **The Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD might have higher volatility and potentially higher or lower returns depending on the specific market conditions.**\n  - Reasoning: Actively managed funds can take advantage of market opportunities and mitigate risks, but they are also more susceptible to the manager's decisions and market fluctuations.\n- **Using a different network connection might help avoid HTTP2 protocol errors and CAPTCHA blocks.**\n  - Reasoning: Different network connections can have different configurations and security settings, which might allow us to bypass the issues we encountered.\n- **Accessing the data through a financial database like Morningstar might be a viable alternative if direct access to Fidelity's website remains problematic.**\n  - Reasoning: Financial databases often provide comprehensive and reliable performance data for mutual funds, which can be accessed without encountering the same network issues.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n1. **Use a Different Network Connection**\n   - Attempt to use a different network connection to avoid HTTP2 protocol errors and CAPTCHA blocks.\n\n2. **Use Google for Search**\n   - Use WebSurfer to search for \"Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024\" on Google.\n   - If the search results do not provide direct links, navigate to Fidelity's official website.\n\n3. **Navigate to Fidelity's Website**\n   - Manually navigate to Fidelity's official website.\n   - Search for the list of international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - Use the search function or navigate to the mutual funds section to find the relevant funds.\n\n4. **Collect Performance Data**\n   - For each identified fund, collect the performance data (percentage increase) from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - If necessary, navigate to detailed fund pages or use the search function on Fidelity's website to find the required data.\n   - Use WebSurfer's sleep function to wait for pages to fully load before collecting data.\n\n5. **Verify and Organize Data**\n   - Use Assistant to organize the collected data into a structured format (e.g., a table or list).\n   - Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each fund over the specified period.\n\n6. **Identify the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase**\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculated values.\n   - Prepare a final report with the relevant data.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Use a Different Network Connection**\n   - Attempt to use a different network connection to avoid HTTP2 protocol errors and CAPTCHA blocks.\n\n2. **Use Google for Search**\n   - Use WebSurfer to search for \"Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds $0 transaction fees performance data May 2019 to May 2024\" on Google.\n   - If the search results do not provide direct links, navigate to Fidelity's official website and search for the list of international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n\nLet's start with the first step.

Include specific keywords like \"performance data,\" \"percentage increase,\" and \"May 2019 to May 2024\" to get more relevant results.\n\n3. **Navigate to Fidelity's Website Directly**\n   - If the search results do not provide direct links, manually navigate to Fidelity's official website.\n   - Use the search function or navigate to the mutual funds section to find the relevant funds.\n\n4. **Collect Performance Data**\n   - For each identified fund, collect the performance data (percentage increase) from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   -
