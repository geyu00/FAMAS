Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Harkness Memorial State Park.\n   - The time of interest is 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n   - The address of Harkness Memorial State Park is 275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385.\n   - Some nearby eateries include:\n     - **Mambo Bar & Restaurant**: 200 Bank St, New London, CT 06320\n     - **Fred's Shanty Restaurant**: 272 Pequot Ave, New London, CT 06320\n     - **Captain Scott's Lobster Dock**: 80 Hamilton St, New London, CT 06320\n     - **Paul's Pasta Shop**: 155 Bank St, New London, CT 06320\n     - **Lucky Inn Chinese Restaurant**: 200 Bank St, New London, CT 06320\n     - **Hot Rod Cafe**: 114 Bank St, New London, CT 06320\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact operating hours for each of the listed eateries, specifically their closing times on Wednesdays.\n   - The distances from Harkness Memorial State Park to each of the listed eateries.\n   - Additional nearby eateries and their operating hours.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each of the nearby eateries.\n   - Determining which of these eateries is the closest and still open at 11 PM on Wednesdays based on the collected data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that many restaurants near the park will have standard closing times, but some might stay open later, especially if they cater to nightlife or late-night diners. For example, Mambo Bar & Restaurant is known to have late-night hours.\n   - The closest eatery might be within a few miles of the park, as areas surrounding state parks often have some form of dining options for visitors. Given the addresses, it appears that several eateries are located in New London, which is relatively close to Waterford.\n   - **New Guess**: Based on the addresses provided, it seems that eateries in New London are within a reasonable driving distance from Harkness Memorial State Park. Therefore, one of these eateries is likely to be the closest and still open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n**Reasoning for New Guess**:\n- The addresses of the eateries are in New London, which is a neighboring town to Waterford. This suggests that the driving distance between these eateries and Harkness Memorial State Park is relatively short.\n- Given that some of these eateries, like Mambo Bar & Restaurant, are known to have late-night hours, it is plausible that one of them remains open until 11 PM or later on Wednesdays.\n\nLet's proceed by verifying the operating hours and distances for the listed eateries to confirm our educated guesses.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Complex Search Queries**: The search queries were too complex, leading to difficulties in extracting specific information.\n2. **Inconsistent Data Extraction**: The web surfer was unable to reliably extract and verify the operating hours and distances for the listed eateries.\n3. **Lack of Structured Approach**: The approach did not have a clear, step-by-step method to ensure all necessary information was gathered and verified.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Break Down the Search Queries**:\n   - **Step 1**: Search for the exact operating hours of each eatery individually.\n   - **Step 2**: Search for the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each eatery individually.\n\n2. **Use Google Maps for Consistent Data**:\n   - **Step 3**: Use Google Maps to find the operating hours and distances for each eatery. Google Maps is a reliable source for this information.\n\n3. **Verify Each Eaterie Individually**:\n   - **Step 4**: For each eatery, open its Google Maps listing to verify the operating hours and distance.\n   - **Step 5**: Note down the relevant information for each eatery.\n\n4. **Determine the Closest Eaterie Open at 11 PM on Wednesdays**:\n   - **Step 6**: Compare the distances and operating hours to identify the closest eatery that is open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n5. **Double-Check the Final Selection**:\n   - **Step 7**: Verify the final selection by checking the restaurant's official website or recent reviews to ensure the information is accurate.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1**: Search for the exact operating hours of each eatery individually.\n  - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to search for the operating hours of each eatery on Google Maps.\n  - **Example Query**: \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant operating hours\"\n\n- **Step 2**: Search for the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each eatery individually.\n  - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to search for the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each eatery on Google Maps.\n  - **Example Query**: \"Distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to Mambo Bar & Restaurant\"\n\n- **Step 3**: Use Google Maps to find the operating hours and distances for each eatery.\n  - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Google Maps page for each eatery.\n  - **Example Action**: Open the Google Maps page for \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant\" and extract the operating hours and distance.\n\n- **Step 4**: For each eatery, open its Google Maps listing to verify the operating hours and distance.\n  - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to open the Google Maps listing for each eatery and note down the relevant information.\n  - **Example Action**: Click on the \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant\" listing on Google Maps and extract the operating hours and distance.\n\n- **Step 5**: Note down the relevant information for each eatery.\n  - **Action**: Record the operating hours and distance for each eatery in a structured format.\n\n- **Step 6**: Compare the distances and operating hours to identify the closest eatery that is open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n  - **Action**: Use the recorded information to determine the closest eatery that is open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n- **Step 7**: Verify the final selection by checking the restaurant's official website or recent reviews.\n  - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to visit the official website or recent reviews of the selected eatery to ensure the information is accurate.\n  - **Example Action**: Visit the official website of \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant\" to verify the operating hours.\n\nBy breaking down the tasks and using a consistent and reliable source like Google Maps, we can avoid the previous issues and accurately determine the closest eatery to Harkness Memorial State Park that is still open at 11 PM on Wednesdays."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the closest eatery to Harkness Memorial State Park that is still open at 11pm on Wednesdays?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n- The location of interest is Harkness Memorial State Park.\n- The time of interest is 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n- The address of Harkness Memorial State Park is 275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385.\n- Some nearby eateries include:\n  - **Mambo Bar & Restaurant**: 200 Bank St, New London, CT 06320\n  - **Fred's Shanty Restaurant**: 272 Pequot Ave, New London, CT 06320\n  - **Captain Scott's Lobster Dock**: 80 Hamilton St, New London, CT 06320\n  - **Paul's Pasta Shop**: 155 Bank St, New London, CT 06320\n  - **Lucky Inn Chinese Restaurant**: 200 Bank St, New London, CT 06320\n  - **Hot Rod Cafe**: 114 Bank St, New London, CT 06320\n\n#### 2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n- The exact operating hours for each of the listed eateries, specifically their closing times on Wednesdays.\n- The distances from Harkness Memorial State Park to each of the listed eateries.\n- Additional nearby eateries and their operating hours.\n\n#### 3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n- The distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each of the nearby eateries.\n- Determining which of these eateries is the closest and still open at 11 PM on Wednesdays based on the collected data.\n\n#### 4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n- It is likely that many restaurants near the park will have standard closing times, but some might stay open later, especially if they cater to nightlife or late-night diners. For example, Mambo Bar & Restaurant is known to have late-night hours.\n- The closest eatery might be within a few miles of the park, as areas surrounding state parks often have some form of dining options for visitors. Given the addresses, it appears that several eateries are located in New London, which is relatively close to Waterford.\n- **New Guess**: Based on the addresses provided, it seems that eateries in New London are within a reasonable driving distance from Harkness Memorial State Park. Therefore, one of these eateries is likely to be the closest and still open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n**Reasoning for New Guess**:\n- The addresses of the eateries are in New London, which is a neighboring town to Waterford. This suggests that the driving distance between these eateries and Harkness Memorial State Park is relatively short.\n- Given that some of these eateries, like Mambo Bar & Restaurant, are known to have late-night hours, it is plausible that one of them remains open until 11 PM or later on Wednesdays.\n- **Additional Guess**: Hot Rod Cafe, being a sports bar, is likely to have late-night hours, making it a strong candidate for being open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Search for Operating Hours**:\n   - Use Google Maps to find the exact operating hours for each eatery, specifically their closing times on Wednesdays.\n   - **Action**: Search for \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant operating hours\" on Google Maps and note the closing time on Wednesdays.\n   - **Action**: Repeat the above step for Fred's Shanty Restaurant, Captain Scott's Lobster Dock, Paul's Pasta Shop, Lucky Inn Chinese Restaurant, and Hot Rod Cafe.\n\n2. **Search for Distances**:\n   - Use Google Maps to find the driving distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each eatery.\n   - **Action**: Search for \"Directions from Harkness Memorial State Park to Mambo Bar & Restaurant\" on Google Maps and note the distance.\n   - **Action**: Repeat the above step for Fred's Shanty Restaurant, Captain Scott's Lobster Dock, Paul's Pasta Shop, Lucky Inn Chinese Restaurant, and Hot Rod Cafe.\n\n3. **Compare and Determine the Closest Eaterie**:\n   - Once the operating hours and distances are noted, compare the information to determine the closest eatery that is open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately determine the closest eatery to Harkness Memorial State Park that is still open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inconsistent Data Collection**:\n   - The web searches were not consistently providing the required information, such as operating hours and distances.\n   - There were multiple instances where the web surfer returned to the main Google Maps page instead of the specific restaurant page, leading to loss of context.\n\n2. **Complex Search Queries**:\n   - The search queries were sometimes too complex, making it difficult to extract specific information.\n   - For example, searching for both operating hours and distance in a single query led to confusion and incorrect results.\n\n3. **Lack of Structured Approach**:\n   - The process lacked a clear, step-by-step method to ensure all necessary information was gathered and verified.\n   - There was no systematic way to track the progress and ensure that all eateries were checked.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Break Down the Search Queries**:\n   - **Step 1**: Search for the exact operating hours of each eatery individually.\n     - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to search for \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant operating hours\" on Google Maps.\n     - **Example Query**: \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant operating hours\"\n   - **Step 2**: Search for the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each eatery individually.\n     - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to search for \"Directions from Harkness Memorial State Park to Mambo Bar & Restaurant\" on Google Maps.\n     - **Example Query**: \"Directions from Harkness Memorial State Park to Mambo Bar & Restaurant\"\n\n2. **Use Google Maps for Consistent Data**:\n   - **Step 3**: Use Google Maps to find the operating hours and distances for each eatery.\n     - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Google Maps page for each eatery.\n     - **Example Action**: Open the Google Maps page for \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant\" and extract the operating hours and distance.\n\n3. **Verify Each Eaterie Individually**:\n   - **Step 4**: For each eatery, open its Google Maps listing to verify the operating hours and distance.\n     - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to open the Google Maps listing for each eatery and note down the relevant information.\n     - **Example Action**: Click on the \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant\" listing on Google Maps and extract the operating hours and distance.\n\n4. **Note Down the Relevant Information**:\n   - **Step 5**: Record the operating hours and distance for each eatery in a structured format.\n     - **Action**: Create a table or list to record the operating hours and distances for each eatery.\n\n5. **Determine the Closest Eaterie Open at 11 PM on Wednesdays**:\n   - **Step 6**: Compare the distances and operating hours to identify the closest eatery that is open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n     - **Action**: Use the recorded information to determine the closest eatery that is open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n6. **Double-Check the Final Selection**:\n   - **Step 7**: Verify the final selection by checking the restaurant's official website or recent reviews to ensure the information is accurate.\n     - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to visit the official website of the selected eatery to verify the operating hours.\n     - **Example Action**: Visit the official website of \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant\" to verify the operating hours.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1**: Search for the exact operating hours of each eatery individually.\n  - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to search for \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant operating hours\" on Google Maps.\n  - **Example Query**: \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant operating hours\"\n\n- **Step 2**: Search for the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each eatery individually.\n  - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to search for \"Directions from Harkness Memorial State Park to Mambo Bar & Restaurant\" on Google Maps.\n  - **Example Query**: \"Directions from Harkness Memorial State Park to Mambo Bar & Restaurant\"\n\n- **Step 3**: Use Google Maps to find the operating hours and distances for each eatery.\n  - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Google Maps page for each eatery.\n  - **Example Action**: Open the Google Maps page for \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant\" and extract the operating hours and distance.\n\n- **Step 4**: For each eatery, open its Google Maps listing to verify the operating hours and distance.\n  - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to open the Google Maps listing for each eatery and note down the relevant information.\n  - **Example Action**: Click on the \"Mambo Bar & Restaurant\" listing on Google Maps and extract the operating hours and distance.\n\n- **Step 5**: Record the operating hours and distance for each eatery in a structured format.\n  - **Action**: Create a table or list to record the operating hours and distances for each eatery.\n  - **Example Table**:\n    | Eaterie Name               | Address                            | Operating Hours (Wednesdays) | Distance from Harkness Memorial State Park |\n    |----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n    | Mambo Bar & Restaurant     | 200 Bank St, New London, CT 06320  | Closes at 11 PM              | 4.5 miles                                 |\n    | Fred's Shanty Restaurant   | 272 Pequot Ave, New London, CT 06320| Closes at 9 PM               | 5 miles                                   |\n    | Captain Scott's Lobster Dock| 80 Hamilton St, New London, CT 06320| Closes at 10 PM              | 4 miles                                   |\n    | Paul's Pasta Shop          | 155 Bank St, New London, CT 06320  | Closes at 10 PM              | 4.8 miles                                 |\n    | Lucky Inn Chinese Restaurant| 200 Bank St, New London, CT 06320  | Closes at 10 PM              | 4.5 miles                                 |\n    | Hot Rod Cafe               | 114 Bank St, New London, CT 06320  | Closes at 11 PM              | 4.2 miles                                 |\n\n- **Step 6**: Compare the distances and operating hours to identify the closest eatery that is open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n  - **Action**: Use the recorded information to determine the closest eatery that is open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n  - **Example**: Hot Rod Cafe is the closest eatery that is open at 11 PM on Wednesdays, with a distance of 4.2 miles.\n\n- **Step 7**: Verify the final selection by checking the restaurant's official website or recent reviews to ensure the information is accurate.\n  -
