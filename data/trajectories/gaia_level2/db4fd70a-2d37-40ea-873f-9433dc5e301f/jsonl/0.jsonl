Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is as of May 2023.\n   - The question pertains to the MBTA’s Franklin-Foxboro line.\n   - The starting point is South Station.\n   - The ending point is Windsor Gardens (not included).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The number of stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens on the MBTA’s Franklin-Foxboro line.\n   - The official MBTA website or a reliable transit map for the Franklin-Foxboro line can provide this information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The MBTA’s Franklin-Foxboro line is known to have several stops, but the exact number between South Station and Windsor Gardens is not immediately clear without checking the official schedule or map.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** WebSurfer will search for the official MBTA website or a reliable source for the current (as of May 2023) Franklin-Foxboro line schedule and map.\n- **Step 2:** WebSurfer will navigate to the relevant page and locate the section detailing the stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens.\n- **Step 3:** WebSurfer will count and list the stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens, ensuring Windsor Gardens is not included in the count.\n- **Step 4:** WebSurfer will verify the accuracy of the count and provide the final number of stops."}
