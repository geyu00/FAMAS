{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich members of Fubo's Management Team joined the company during the same year Fubo's IPO happened?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO (Initial Public Offering).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The year Fubo's IPO took place.\n   - The names and join dates of Fubo's current management team.\n   - These details can be found on Fubo's official website, SEC filings, press releases, and possibly in financial news articles or company reports.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the year of Fubo's IPO with the join dates of the management team to identify who joined in the same year as the IPO.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Fubo's IPO likely occurred within the last few years, given the company's relatively recent rise in the streaming market.\n   - Key executives often join a company around the time of significant milestones like an IPO, but this is not always the case.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Determine the Year of Fubo's IPO**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find the exact year Fubo went public (IPO).\n\n- **Step 2: Identify the Current Management Team**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit Fubo's official website or relevant financial news sites to gather the names and join dates of the current management team.\n\n- **Step 3: Cross-Reference Join Dates with IPO Year**\n  - **Assistant**: Compare the join dates of the management team with the year Fubo's IPO occurred to identify who joined in the same year.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile and Present the Results**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined in the same year as Fubo's IPO."}

The service focuses primarily on channels that distribute live sports. Depending on the country it is accessed in, channels offered by Fubo include access to the \nPremier League, \nNFL, \nMLB, \nNBA, \nNHL, \nMLS, \nCPL, and international football, as well as news, network television series, and movies.\n[3]Launched on January 1, 2015, as a soccer streaming service, Fubo changed to an all-sports service in 2017 and then to a \nvirtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) model.\n[4] As a vMVPD, Fubo still markets itself as a sports-first service, but it has since expanded its programming to include channels that fall under other genres, including ones with reality shows, premium movies and cable news. \nIn the U.S., there are several service options with different channel lineups, including a base package of over 100 linear content channels, which also include free content streams that are found on competing services like \nYouTube TV. A number of add-on packages are also available for viewers who want more programming options, Spanish-language content, premium movie networks or additional features.\n[5] As of February 2025\n, the company says it has 2.038 million global paying subscribers, including 1.676 million subscribers in North America.\n[6]On January 6, 2025, \nthe Walt Disney Company announced its intent to acquire a 70% stake in Fubo, who will merge with \nHulu's live TV service.

In France, the company operates Molotov by Fubo, one of the country's most popular streaming services.\nUnder David's leadership, Fubo is redefining the traditional TV model through its proprietary tech and data platform, as well as a dynamic user experience, all optimized for live TV and sports. Fubo was the first virtual MVPD to launch 4K HDR streams, user-configured multiviewing and personalized game alerts for consumers.\nFubo listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in October 2020, just five years after its founding. Fubo has ranked among The Americas' Fastest-Growing Companies by the Financial Times (2025) and Forbes' Next Billion Dollar Startups (2019).\nPrior to founding Fubo in 2015, David had a prolific advertising career with more than 15 years of video sales in local broadcast and cable TV within both the general and Hispanic market, including at Scripps Networks Interactive, Time Warner Cable Media Sales and NBCUniversal's Telemundo Media.\nBeyond Fubo, David is a prominent figure in global sports and media. Through Gandler Sports Group (GSG), David is the majority owner and board member of soccer team Leyton Orient F.C. (EFL League One), and is a former co-owner of Paris FC. He also serves on the board of directors of Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship (BKFC) and is a member of the esteemed Paley Media Council.\nDavid has been named among Sports Business Journal's Power Players: Sports Streaming (2025), Goldman Sachs' 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs (2019) and Variety's Dealmakers (2020, 2019).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich members of Fubo's Management Team joined the company during the same year Fubo's IPO happened?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n---\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO (Initial Public Offering).\n   - Fubo's IPO took place on October 13, 2020.\n   - Some members of the management team joined in 2020:\n     - David Gandler: Co-Founder and CEO, appointed in April 2020.\n     - Gina DiGioia: Chief Legal Officer, joined in 2020.\n     - John Janedis: Chief Financial Officer, joined in 2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The names and join dates of the remaining members of Fubo's current management team.\n   - These details can be found on Fubo's official website, SEC filings, press releases, and possibly in financial news articles or company reports.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the year of Fubo's IPO (2020) with the join dates of the entire management team to identify who joined in the same year as the IPO.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that Fubo's IPO occurred in 2020, it is likely that other key executives joined around the same time to support the company's transition to a publicly traded entity.\n   - Executives such as Eric Renard (Chief Technology Officer), Todd Mathers (EVP, Content Strategy & Acquisition), and Yale Wang (EVP / Head, Marketing) might have joined in 2020, as their roles are crucial for a company preparing for and managing an IPO.\n   - The average tenure of the management team being approximately 3.4 years suggests that many of the current executives joined around 2020, which aligns with the IPO year.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Confirm Join Dates of Remaining Management Team Members**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit Fubo's official website (https://corporate.fubo.tv/leadership-team/) and extract the join dates of the remaining management team members.\n  - **WebSurfer**: If the join dates are not available on the official website, search for press releases or other reliable sources that might provide this information.\n\n- **Step 2: Cross-Reference Join Dates with IPO Year**\n  - **Assistant**: Compare the join dates of the management team with the year Fubo's IPO occurred (2020) to identify who joined in the same year.\n\n- **Step 3: Compile and Present the Results**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined in the same year as Fubo's IPO.\n\n---\n\nPlease proceed with the next steps to gather the join dates of the remaining management team members.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Information on Join Dates**: The official Fubo corporate site did not provide specific join dates for all members of the management team. This led to incomplete data collection.\n2. **Repetitive Searches**: We repeatedly searched for the same information without exploring alternative sources or methods to find the missing join dates.\n3. **Insufficient Scrolling and Exploration**: The initial attempts to scroll through the Fubo corporate site were not thorough enough to capture all the necessary information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Thoroughly Explore Fubo's Official Website**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit Fubo's official corporate site (https://corporate.fubo.tv/leadership-team/) and thoroughly scroll through the entire page to ensure all available information is captured.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Take screenshots or notes of the entire leadership team section to avoid missing any details.\n\n- **Step 2: Search for Additional Sources**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles that might contain the join dates of the management team members.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Use specific search queries like \"Fubo management team join dates 2020\" to narrow down the results.\n\n- **Step 3: Cross-Reference and Compile Data**\n  - **Assistant**: Once the join dates are gathered, cross-reference them with the year of Fubo's IPO (2020).\n  - **Assistant**: Compile a list of management team members who joined in 2020.\n\n- **Step 4: Present the Results**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined in the same year as Fubo's IPO.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Thoroughly Explore Fubo's Official Website**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to https://corporate.fubo.tv/leadership-team/.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the entire page and take screenshots or detailed notes of the leadership team section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure all names and available information are captured.\n\n2. **Search for Additional Sources**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query \"Fubo management team join dates 2020\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the top results, focusing on press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract any join dates mentioned for the management team members.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference and Compile Data**\n   - **Assistant**: List all management team members and their join dates.\n   - **Assistant**: Cross-reference these dates with the year 2020.\n   - **Assistant**: Identify and compile the names of those who joined in 2020.\n\n4. **Present the Results**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined in 2020.\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to gather the necessary information more effectively and avoid the previous issues."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich members of Fubo's Management Team joined the company during the same year Fubo's IPO happened?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Let's update the fact sheet with the new information and refine our educated guesses based on the progress we've made so far.\n\n---\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO (Initial Public Offering).\n   - Fubo's IPO took place on October 13, 2020.\n   - Confirmed join dates of some members of the management team:\n     - David Gandler: Co-Founder and CEO, joined in April 2020.\n     - Gina DiGioia: Chief Legal Officer, joined in 2020.\n     - John Janedis: Chief Financial Officer, joined in 2020.\n     - Alberto Horihuela: Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer, joined in 2015.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The names and join dates of the remaining members of Fubo's current management team.\n   - These details can be found on Fubo's official website, SEC filings, press releases, and possibly in financial news articles or company reports.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the year of Fubo's IPO (2020) with the join dates of the entire management team to identify who joined in the same year as the IPO.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that Fubo's IPO occurred in 2020, it is likely that other key executives joined around the same time to support the company's transition to a publicly traded entity.\n   - Executives such as Eric Renard (Chief Technology Officer), Todd Mathers (EVP, Content Strategy & Acquisition), and Yale Wang (EVP / Head, Marketing) might have joined in 2020, as their roles are crucial for a company preparing for and managing an IPO.\n   - The average tenure of the management team being approximately 3.4 years suggests that many of the current executives joined around 2020, which aligns with the IPO year.\n   - It is also possible that Lawrence Wills (EVP, Controller) and Marina Anoshin (SVP, Finance & Operations) joined around the same time, given their critical roles in financial management and operations, which are essential during an IPO.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Confirm Join Dates of Remaining Management Team Members**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit Fubo's official website (https://corporate.fubo.tv/leadership-team/) and extract the join dates of the remaining management team members.\n  - **WebSurfer**: If the join dates are not available on the official website, search for press releases or other reliable sources that might provide this information.\n\n- **Step 2: Cross-Reference Join Dates with IPO Year**\n  - **Assistant**: Compare the join dates of the management team with the year Fubo's IPO occurred (2020) to identify who joined in the same year.\n\n- **Step 3: Compile and Present the Results**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined in the same year as Fubo's IPO.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Thoroughly Explore Fubo's Official Website**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to https://corporate.fubo.tv/leadership-team/.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the entire page and take screenshots or detailed notes of the leadership team section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure all names and available information are captured.\n\n2. **Search for Additional Sources**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query \"Fubo management team join dates 2020\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the top results, focusing on press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract any join dates mentioned for the management team members.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference and Compile Data**\n   - **Assistant**: List all management team members and their join dates.\n   - **Assistant**: Cross-reference these dates with the year 2020.\n   - **Assistant**: Identify and compile the names of those who joined in 2020.\n\n4. **Present the Results**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined in the same year as Fubo's IPO.\n\n---\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to gather the join dates of the remaining management team members. Please visit the following links and extract the join dates:\n\n1. **Fubo Corporate** (https://corporate.fubo.tv/leadership-team/)\n2. **Fubo - Governance - Management Team** (https://ir.fubo.tv/governance)\n3. **fuboTV Inc.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich members of Fubo's Management Team joined the company during the same year Fubo's IPO happened?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Let's update the fact sheet with the new information and refine our educated guesses based on the progress we've made so far.\n\n---\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO (Initial Public Offering).\n   - Fubo's IPO took place on October 13, 2020.\n   - Confirmed join dates of some members of the management team:\n     - David Gandler: Co-Founder and CEO, joined in April 2020.\n     - Gina DiGioia: Chief Legal Officer, joined in 2020.\n     - John Janedis: Chief Financial Officer, joined in 2020.\n     - Alberto Horihuela: Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer, joined in 2015.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The names and join dates of the remaining members of Fubo's current management team.\n   - These details can be found on Fubo's official website, SEC filings, press releases, and possibly in financial news articles or company reports.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the year of Fubo's IPO (2020) with the join dates of the entire management team to identify who joined in the same year as the IPO.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that Fubo's IPO occurred in 2020, it is likely that other key executives joined around the same time to support the company's transition to a publicly traded entity.\n   - Executives such as Eric Renard (Chief Technology Officer), Todd Mathers (EVP, Content Strategy & Acquisition), and Yale Wang (EVP / Head, Marketing) might have joined in 2020, as their roles are crucial for a company preparing for and managing an IPO.\n   - The average tenure of the management team being approximately 3.4 years suggests that many of the current executives joined around 2020, which aligns with the IPO year.\n   - It is also possible that Lawrence Wills (EVP, Controller) and Marina Anoshin (SVP, Finance & Operations) joined around the same time, given their critical roles in financial management and operations, which are essential during an IPO.\n   - **New Guess**: Based on the search results, it appears that some of the management team members joined in 2020, but the exact dates for some are still unknown. We should focus on verifying the join dates for Eric Renard, Todd Mathers, Yale Wang, Lawrence Wills, and Marina Anoshin.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Confirm Join Dates of Remaining Management Team Members**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit Fubo's official website (https://corporate.fubo.tv/leadership-team/) and extract the join dates of the remaining management team members.\n  - **WebSurfer**: If the join dates are not available on the official website, search for press releases or other reliable sources that might provide this information.\n\n- **Step 2: Cross-Reference Join Dates with IPO Year**\n  - **Assistant**: Compare the join dates of the management team with the year Fubo's IPO occurred (2020) to identify who joined in the same year.\n\n- **Step 3: Compile and Present the Results**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined in the same year as Fubo's IPO.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Thoroughly Explore Fubo's Official Website**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to https://corporate.fubo.tv/leadership-team/.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the entire page and take screenshots or detailed notes of the leadership team section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure all names and available information are captured.\n\n2. **Search for Additional Sources**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query \"Fubo management team join dates 2020\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the top results, focusing on press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract any join dates mentioned for the management team members.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference and Compile Data**\n   - **Assistant**: List all management team members and their join dates.\n   - **Assistant**: Cross-reference these dates with the year 2020.\n   - **Assistant**: Identify and compile the names of those who joined in 2020.\n\n4. **Present the Results**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined in the same year as Fubo's IPO.\n\n---\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to gather the join dates of the remaining management team members. Please visit the following links and extract the join dates:\n\n1. **Fubo Corporate** (https://corporate.fubo.tv/leadership-team/)\n2. **Fubo - Governance - Management Team** (https://ir.fubo.tv/governance)\n3. **fuboTV Inc. (FUBO) Leadership & Management Team Analysis** (https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/nyse/fubo/fubotv/management)\n\nExtract and provide the join dates for the remaining members of the management team.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Information on Join Dates**: The official Fubo corporate site did not provide specific join dates for all members of the management team, leading to incomplete data collection.\n2. **Repetitive Searches**: We repeatedly searched for the same information without exploring alternative sources or methods to find the missing join dates.\n3. **Insufficient Scrolling and Exploration**: The initial attempts to scroll through the Fubo corporate site were not thorough enough to capture all the necessary information.\n4. **Overlooking Alternative Sources**: We did not explore other reliable sources such as SEC filings, press releases, and financial news articles in depth.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Thoroughly Explore Fubo's Official Website**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to https://corporate.fubo.tv/leadership-team/ and scroll through the entire page to ensure all available information is captured.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Take detailed notes or screenshots of the leadership team section.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check if there are any additional pages or sections that might contain more detailed information about the management team.\n\n- **Step 2: Search for Additional Reliable Sources**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query \"Fubo management team join dates 2020\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the top results, focusing on press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Extract any join dates mentioned for the management team members.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Specifically look for official company announcements, annual reports, and investor presentations.\n\n- **Step 3: Cross-Reference and Compile Data**\n  - **Assistant**: List all management team members and their join dates.\n  - **Assistant**: Cross-reference these dates with the year 2020.\n  - **Assistant**: Identify and compile the names of those who joined in 2020.\n\n- **Step 4: Present the Results**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined in the same year as Fubo's IPO.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Thoroughly Explore Fubo's Official Website**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to https://corporate.fubo.tv/leadership-team/.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the entire page and take detailed notes or screenshots of the leadership team section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure all names and available information are captured.\n\n2. **Search for Additional Reliable Sources**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query \"Fubo management team join dates 2020\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the top results, focusing on press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract any join dates mentioned for the management team members.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Specifically look for official company announcements, annual reports, and investor presentations.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference and Compile Data**\n   - **Assistant**: List all management team members and their join dates.\n   - **Assistant**: Cross-reference these dates with the year 2020.\n   - **Assistant**: Identify and compile the names of those who joined in 2020.\n\n4. **Present the Results**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined in the same year as Fubo's IPO.\n\n---\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan to gather the join dates of the remaining management team members."}
