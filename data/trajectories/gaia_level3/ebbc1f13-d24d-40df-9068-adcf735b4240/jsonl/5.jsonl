GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The year 1994 is mentioned as the context for an example sentence.\n   - The word in question is \"gimlie\" from the Yola language.\n   - The Latin root of \"gimlie\" is \"camināta.\"\n   - The Spanish word that shares the same spelling as the Latin root \"camināta\" is \"caminata.\"\n   - The source is the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The 1994 example sentence for the Spanish word \"caminata\" in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online.\n   - The source title for the 1994 example sentence in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online.\n   - The Google translation of the source title for the 1994 example sentence.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The exact meaning and usage of \"gimlie\" in Yola.\n   - The relevance of the 1994 example sentence to the Spanish word \"caminata\" and its Latin root \"camināta.\"\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The 1994 example sentence is likely from a literary or historical source, given the specific year mentioned.\n   - The source title might be a book, article, or other publication that was significant in 1994.\n   - The Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary might categorize example sentences by year, which could help in finding the 1994 example sentence.\n\n### Explanation of Updates:\n- **Verified Facts**: Added the Latin root of \"gimlie\" as \"camināta\" and the corresponding Spanish word \"caminata\" based on the information found in Wiktionary.\n- **Educated Guesses**: Added a new guess that the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary might categorize example sentences by year, which could help in finding the 1994 example sentence. This is based on the specific mention of the year 1994 and the structured nature of dictionaries.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Lack of Specific Search**: The search for the 1994 example sentence in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary was not specific enough. We did not use the search function within the dictionary to filter by year, which is crucial given the specific year mentioned.\n- **Inefficient Scrolling**: Manually scrolling through the page was inefficient and did not yield the desired results. A more targeted approach is needed.\n- **Missing Key Information**: We did not explicitly check if the Collins dictionary provides a way to filter or search for example sentences by year, which could have streamlined the process.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Use the Search Function**: Utilize the search function within the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary to specifically look for example sentences from 1994.\n- **Filter by Year**: If the dictionary allows, filter the example sentences by the year 1994.\n- **Extract the Source Title**: Once the 1994 example sentence is found, extract the source title.\n- **Translate the Source Title**: Use Google Translate to translate the source title into English.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Open Collins Dictionary Entry for 'caminata'**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary entry for 'caminata'.\n2. **Use the Search Function**:\n   - Use the search function within the dictionary to look for example sentences from 1994.\n3. **Filter by Year**:\n   - If the dictionary has a feature to filter example sentences by year, apply this filter to focus on 1994.\n4. **Locate the 1994 Example Sentence**:\n   - Identify the 1994 example sentence and extract the source title.\n5. **Translate the Source Title**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to open Google Translate and input the source title.\n   - Obtain and provide the translated title.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Search Function**: Look for a search bar or filter options on the Collins dictionary page.\n- **Year Filter**: Check if there is a way to filter example sentences by year.\n- **Efficient Navigation**: Use the search function to avoid manual scrolling and ensure accuracy.\n- **Extract Source Title**: Pay attention to the metadata or additional information provided with the example sentence to find the source title."}
