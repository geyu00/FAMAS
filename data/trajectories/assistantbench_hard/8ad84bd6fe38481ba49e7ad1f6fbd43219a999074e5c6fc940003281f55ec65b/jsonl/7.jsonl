{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago have ready-to-eat salad for under $15?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is Lincoln Park in Chicago.\n   - The distance criterion is within 2 blocks.\n   - The product of interest is ready-to-eat salad.\n   - The price criterion is under $15.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Names and locations of supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago.\n   - Availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads at these supermarkets.\n   - Specific addresses or coordinates of Lincoln Park in Chicago for precise distance measurement.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether the supermarkets within 2 blocks actually offer ready-to-eat salads.\n   - Whether the ready-to-eat salads at these supermarkets are priced under $15.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Common supermarket chains like Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and Mariano's often have locations in urban areas like Lincoln Park.\n   - These chains typically offer a variety of ready-to-eat salads.\n   - Prices for ready-to-eat salads at these chains are generally in the range of $8 to $15, making it likely that some options will meet the price criterion.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify Supermarkets Near Lincoln Park**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago.\n  - Note down the names and addresses of these supermarkets.\n\n- **Check Availability and Pricing of Ready-to-Eat Salads**\n  - For each identified supermarket, use WebSurfer to visit their website or online store.\n  - Search for the ready-to-eat salad section and note the prices of available salads.\n  - Ensure the prices are under $15.\n\n- **Compile and Present the Results**\n  - Summarize the findings, including the names of the supermarkets, their addresses, and the prices of the ready-to-eat salads that meet the criteria.\n  - Provide this information in a clear and concise format."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago have ready-to-eat salad for under $15?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is Lincoln Park in Chicago.\n   - The distance criterion is within 2 blocks.\n   - The product of interest is ready-to-eat salad.\n   - The price criterion is under $15.\n   - Supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago include:\n     - Whole Foods Market (1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago)\n     - Mariano's (1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago)\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads at Whole Foods Market (1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago) and Mariano's (1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago).\n   - Specific addresses or coordinates of Lincoln Park in Chicago for precise distance measurement.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether Whole Foods Market and Mariano's within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park actually offer ready-to-eat salads.\n   - Whether the ready-to-eat salads at these supermarkets are priced under $15.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Common supermarket chains like Whole Foods and Mariano's often have locations in urban areas like Lincoln Park.\n   - These chains typically offer a variety of ready-to-eat salads.\n   - Prices for ready-to-eat salads at these chains are generally in the range of $8 to $15, making it likely that some options will meet the price criterion.\n   - Given the proximity of these supermarkets to Lincoln Park, they are likely to cater to a diverse customer base, including those looking for convenient and healthy meal options, which supports the likelihood of having ready-to-eat salads.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Common Supermarket Chains:** We have confirmed the presence of Whole Foods Market and Mariano's near Lincoln Park, which are known for offering a wide range of products, including ready-to-eat meals.\n- **Variety of Ready-to-Eat Salads:** Both Whole Foods and Mariano's are well-known for their prepared foods sections, which often include a variety of salads.\n- **Price Range:** Based on typical pricing at these chains, it is reasonable to expect that some ready-to-eat salads will fall within the $8 to $15 range, meeting the price criterion.\n\nNext steps:\n- Visit the specific store pages for Whole Foods Market (1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago) and Mariano's (1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago) to check the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Website Navigation:**\n   - When trying to access the specific Whole Foods Market store page for the Chicago North Kingsbury location, the search led to the UK version of the Whole Foods Market website instead of the US version.\n   - This likely happened due to a misinterpretation of the search query or a regional setting issue in the browser.\n\n2. **Lack of Direct Linking:**\n   - Instead of directly linking to the specific store page, the search results provided a general link to the Whole Foods Market website, which did not automatically redirect to the correct store page.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Directly Access the Correct Store Pages:**\n   - Use the specific URLs for the Whole Foods Market and Mariano's stores to avoid regional redirection issues.\n   - For Whole Foods Market, use the URL: `https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/chicago-north-kingsbury`\n   - For Mariano's, use the URL: `https://www.marianos.com/stores/lincoln-park`\n\n2. **Verify and Navigate to the Ready-to-Eat Salad Section:**\n   - Once on the correct store pages, navigate to the ready-to-eat salad section.\n   - For Whole Foods Market, look for the \"Prepared Foods\" or \"Salad Bar\" section.\n   - For Mariano's, look for the \"Deli\" or \"Salad\" section.\n\n3. **Check Availability and Pricing:**\n   - Note the prices of the ready-to-eat salads and ensure they are under $15.\n   - If the prices are not directly listed, use the search functionality or browse through the categories to find the relevant information.\n\n4. **Summarize and Present the Results:**\n   - Compile the findings, including the names of the supermarkets, their addresses, and the prices of the ready-to-eat salads that meet the criteria.\n   - Provide this information in a clear and concise format.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1: Access Whole Foods Market Store Page**\n  - WebSurfer, please go to the URL: `https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/chicago-north-kingsbury`\n  - Navigate to the \"Prepared Foods\" or \"Salad Bar\" section and check for ready-to-eat salads priced under $15.\n\n- **Step 2: Access Mariano's Store Page**\n  - WebSurfer, please go to the URL: `https://www.marianos.com/stores/lincoln-park`\n  - Navigate to the \"Deli\" or \"Salad\" section and check for ready-to-eat salads priced under $15.\n\n- **Step 3: Compile and Present the Results**\n  - Summarize the findings, including the names of the supermarkets, their addresses, and the prices of the ready-to-eat salads that meet the criteria.\n  - Provide this information in a clear and concise format.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to accurately identify the supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago that offer ready-to-eat salads for under $15."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago have ready-to-eat salad for under $15?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is Lincoln Park in Chicago.\n   - The distance criterion is within 2 blocks.\n   - The product of interest is ready-to-eat salad.\n   - The price criterion is under $15.\n   - Supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago include:\n     - Whole Foods Market (1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago)\n     - Mariano's (1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago)\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads at Whole Foods Market (1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago) and Mariano's (1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago).\n   - Specific addresses or coordinates of Lincoln Park in Chicago for precise distance measurement.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether Whole Foods Market and Mariano's within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park actually offer ready-to-eat salads.\n   - Whether the ready-to-eat salads at these supermarkets are priced under $15.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Common supermarket chains like Whole Foods and Mariano's often have locations in urban areas like Lincoln Park.\n   - These chains typically offer a variety of ready-to-eat salads.\n   - Prices for ready-to-eat salads at these chains are generally in the range of $8 to $15, making it likely that some options will meet the price criterion.\n   - Given the proximity of these supermarkets to Lincoln Park, they are likely to cater to a diverse customer base, including those looking for convenient and healthy meal options, which supports the likelihood of having ready-to-eat salads.\n   - The issue with navigating to the correct Whole Foods Market store page might be due to regional settings or browser configurations. Using a search engine to find the specific store page might be more reliable.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Common Supermarket Chains:** We have confirmed the presence of Whole Foods Market and Mariano's near Lincoln Park, which are known for offering a wide range of products, including ready-to-eat meals.\n- **Variety of Ready-to-Eat Salads:** Both Whole Foods and Mariano's are well-known for their prepared foods sections, which often include a variety of salads.\n- **Price Range:** Based on typical pricing at these chains, it is reasonable to expect that some ready-to-eat salads will fall within the $8 to $15 range, meeting the price criterion.\n- **Regional Settings and Browser Configurations:** The repeated redirection to the UK site suggests that there might be an issue with the browser's region settings or configuration. Using a search engine to find the specific store page is a more robust approach to avoid such issues.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Use a Search Engine to Find the Correct Store Pages:**\n   - Go to a search engine (e.g., Google, Bing) and search for \"Whole Foods Market Chicago North Kingsbury\".\n   - Click on the first relevant result to navigate to the correct store page.\n   - Repeat the process for Mariano's Lincoln Park store.\n\n2. **Verify and Navigate to the Ready-to-Eat Salad Section:**\n   - Once on the correct store pages, navigate to the 'Prepared Foods' or 'Salad Bar' section for Whole Foods Market and the 'Deli' or 'Salad' section for Mariano's.\n   - Check for the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads.\n\n3. **Compile and Present the Results:**\n   - Summarize the findings, including the names of the supermarkets, their addresses, and the prices of the ready-to-eat salads that meet the criteria.\n   - Provide this information in a clear and concise format.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to accurately identify the supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago that offer ready-to-eat salads for under $15.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Regional Redirection:**\n   - The web browser consistently redirected to the UK version of the Whole Foods Market website instead of the US version.\n   - This issue likely stems from regional settings or browser configurations.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use a Search Engine to Find the Correct Store Pages:**\n   - WebSurfer, please go to a search engine (e.g., Google, Bing) and search for \"Whole Foods Market Chicago North Kingsbury\".\n   - Click on the first relevant result to navigate to the correct store page.\n   - Repeat the process for Mariano's Lincoln Park store.\n\n2. **Verify and Navigate to the Ready-to-Eat Salad Section:**\n   - Once on the correct store pages:\n     - For Whole Foods Market, navigate to the 'Prepared Foods' or 'Salad Bar' section.\n     - For Mariano's, navigate to the 'Deli' or 'Salad' section.\n   - Check for the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads.\n\n3. **Compile and Present the Results:**\n   - Summarize the findings, including the names of the supermarkets, their addresses, and the prices of the ready-to-eat salads that meet the criteria.\n   - Provide this information in a clear and concise format.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1: Search for Whole Foods Market Chicago North Kingsbury**\n  - WebSurfer, please go to a search engine and search for \"Whole Foods Market Chicago North Kingsbury\".\n  - Click on the first relevant result to navigate to the correct store page.\n\n- **Step 2: Search for Mariano's Lincoln Park**\n  - WebSurfer, please go to a search engine and search for \"Mariano's Lincoln Park\".\n  - Click on the first relevant result to navigate to the correct store page.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify and Navigate to the Ready-to-Eat Salad Section**\n  - For Whole Foods Market, navigate to the 'Prepared Foods' or 'Salad Bar' section.\n  - For Mariano's, navigate to the 'Deli' or 'Salad' section.\n  - Check for the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile and Present the Results**\n  - Summarize the findings, including the names of the supermarkets, their addresses, and the prices of the ready-to-eat salads that meet the criteria.\n  - Provide this information in a clear and concise format.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to accurately identify the supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago that offer ready-to-eat salads for under $15."}

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is Lincoln Park in Chicago.\n   - The distance criterion is within 2 blocks.\n   - The product of interest is ready-to-eat salad.\n   - The price criterion is under $15.\n   - Supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago include:\n     - Whole Foods Market (1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago)\n     - Mariano's (1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago)\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads at Whole Foods Market (1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago) and Mariano's (1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago).\n   - Specific addresses or coordinates of Lincoln Park in Chicago for precise distance measurement.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether Whole Foods Market and Mariano's within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park actually offer ready-to-eat salads.\n   - Whether the ready-to-eat salads at these supermarkets are priced under $15.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Common supermarket chains like Whole Foods and Mariano's often have locations in urban areas like Lincoln Park.\n   - These chains typically offer a variety of ready-to-eat salads.\n   - Prices for ready-to-eat salads at these chains are generally in the range of $8 to $15, making it likely that some options will meet the price criterion.\n   - Given the proximity of these supermarkets to Lincoln Park, they are likely to cater to a diverse customer base, including those looking for convenient and healthy meal options, which supports the likelihood of having ready-to-eat salads.\n   - The issue with navigating to the correct Whole Foods Market store page might be due to regional settings or browser configurations. Using a search engine to find the specific store page might be more reliable.\n   - **New Educated Guess:** The search engine Bing might be causing issues with regional redirection. Using Google might provide more accurate and direct results.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Common Supermarket Chains:** We have confirmed the presence of Whole Foods Market and Mariano's near Lincoln Park, which are known for offering a wide range of products, including ready-to-eat meals.\n- **Variety of Ready-to-Eat Salads:** Both Whole Foods and Mariano's are well-known for their prepared foods sections, which often include a variety of salads.\n- **Price Range:** Based on typical pricing at these chains, it is reasonable to expect that some ready-to-eat salads will fall within the $8 to $15 range, meeting the price criterion.\n- **Regional Settings and Browser Configurations:** The repeated redirection to the UK site suggests that there might be an issue with the browser's region settings or configuration. Using a search engine to find the specific store page is a more robust approach to avoid such issues.\n- **Search Engine Reliability:** Given the issues encountered with Bing, it is reasonable to assume that Google might provide more accurate and direct results, as it is a widely used and reliable search engine.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Use Google to Find the Correct Store Pages:**\n   - Go to Google (https://www.google.com) and search for \"Whole Foods Market Chicago North Kingsbury\".\n   - Click on the first relevant result to navigate to the correct store page.\n   - Repeat the process for Mariano's Lincoln Park by searching for \"Mariano's Lincoln Park\" and clicking on the first relevant result.\n\n2. **Verify and Navigate to the Ready-to-Eat Salad Section:**\n   - Once on the correct store pages, navigate to the 'Prepared Foods' or 'Salad Bar' section for Whole Foods Market and the 'Deli' or 'Salad' section for Mariano's.\n   - Check for the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads.\n\n3. **Compile and Present the Results:**\n   - Summarize the findings, including the names of the supermarkets, their addresses, and the prices of the ready-to-eat salads that meet the criteria.\n   - Provide this information in a clear and concise format.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to accurately identify the supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago that offer ready-to-eat salads for under $15.\n\n### Action Items\n\n- **Step 1: Search for Whole Foods Market Chicago North Kingsbury**\n  - WebSurfer, please go to Google (https://www.google.com) and search for \"Whole Foods Market Chicago North Kingsbury\".\n  - Click on the first relevant result to navigate to the correct store page.\n\n- **Step 2: Search for Mariano's Lincoln Park**\n  - WebSurfer, please go to Google (https://www.google.com) and search for \"Mariano's Lincoln Park\".\n  - Click on the first relevant result to navigate to the correct store page.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify and Navigate to the Ready-to-Eat Salad Section**\n  - For Whole Foods Market, navigate to the 'Prepared Foods' or 'Salad Bar' section.\n  - For Mariano's, navigate to the 'Deli' or 'Salad' section.\n  - Check for the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile and Present the Results**\n  - Summarize the findings, including the names of the supermarkets, their addresses, and the prices of the ready-to-eat salads that meet the criteria.\n  - Provide this information in a clear and concise format.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to gather the required information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Regional Redirection:**\n   - The web browser consistently redirected to the UK version of the Whole Foods Market website instead of the US version, likely due to regional settings or browser configurations.\n\n2. **Ineffective Search Engine:**\n   - Using Bing for the search queries did not yield the expected results, possibly due to its handling of regional settings or search algorithms.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Google for Search Queries:**\n   - Switch to Google (https://www.google.com) for all search queries to avoid regional redirection issues.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Correct Store Pages:**\n   - Perform a search for \"Whole Foods Market Chicago North Kingsbury\" and click on the first relevant result.\n   - Perform a search for \"Mariano's Lincoln Park\" and click on the first relevant result.\n\n3. **Verify and Navigate to the Ready-to-Eat Salad Sections:**\n   - For Whole Foods Market, navigate to the 'Prepared Foods' or 'Salad Bar' section.\n   - For Mariano's, navigate to the 'Deli' or 'Salad' section.\n   - Check for the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads.\n\n4. **Compile and Present the Results:**\n   - Summarize the findings, including the names of the supermarkets, their addresses, and the prices of the ready-to-eat salads that meet the criteria.\n   - Provide this information in a clear and concise format.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1: Search for Whole Foods Market Chicago North Kingsbury**\n  - WebSurfer, please go to Google (https://www.google.com) and search for \"Whole Foods Market Chicago North Kingsbury\".\n  -

Click on the first relevant result to navigate to the correct store page.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify and Navigate to the Ready-to-Eat Salad Sections**\n  - For Whole Foods Market, navigate to the 'Prepared Foods' or 'Salad Bar' section.\n  - For Mariano's, navigate to the 'Deli' or 'Salad' section.\n  - Check for the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile and Present the Results**\n  - Summarize the findings, including the names of the supermarkets, their addresses, and the prices of the ready-to-eat salads that meet the criteria.\n  - Provide this information in a clear and concise format.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to accurately identify the supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago that offer ready-to-eat salads for under $15."}

EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Common supermarket chains like Whole Foods and Mariano's often have locations in urban areas like Lincoln Park.\n- These chains typically offer a variety of ready-to-eat salads.\n- Prices for ready-to-eat salads at these chains are generally in the range of $8 to $15, making it likely that some options will meet the price criterion.\n- Given the proximity of these supermarkets to Lincoln Park, they are likely to cater to a diverse customer base, including those looking for convenient and healthy meal options, which supports the likelihood of having ready-to-eat salads.\n- The issue with navigating to the correct Whole Foods Market store page might be due to regional settings or browser configurations. Using a search engine to find the specific store page might be more reliable.\n- **Updated Educated Guess:** The search engine Bing might be causing issues with regional redirection. Using Google might provide more accurate and direct results, as it is a widely used and reliable search engine.\n- **New Educated Guess:** DuckDuckGo might also provide accurate results and avoid the regional redirection issues encountered with Bing. It is worth trying as an alternative search engine.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Common Supermarket Chains:** We have confirmed the presence of Whole Foods Market and Mariano's near Lincoln Park, which are known for offering a wide range of products, including ready-to-eat meals.\n- **Variety of Ready-to-Eat Salads:** Both Whole Foods and Mariano's are well-known for their prepared foods sections, which often include a variety of salads.\n- **Price Range:** Based on typical pricing at these chains, it is reasonable to expect that some ready-to-eat salads will fall within the $8 to $15 range, meeting the price criterion.\n- **Regional Settings and Browser Configurations:** The repeated redirection to the UK site suggests that there might be an issue with the browser's region settings or configuration. Using a search engine to find the specific store page is a more robust approach to avoid such issues.\n- **Search Engine Reliability:** Given the issues encountered with Bing, it is reasonable to assume that Google might provide more accurate and direct results, as it is a widely used and reliable search engine. Additionally, DuckDuckGo, known for its privacy features, might also provide accurate results and avoid regional redirection issues.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Use Google to Find the Correct Store Pages:**\n   -

The manual steps to navigate to the correct store pages were not executed correctly, leading to repeated redirection issues.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Google with Specific Location Settings:**\n   -
