I will use a query to find the promotion data and details about dinosaur Featured Articles from that month. \n\nLet's execute the relevant search to check the promotions during that time. \n\n### Step 1: Identify the Featured Article promoted in November 2016.\n\nI will formulate a search for Featured Articles that were promoted during that time, particularly those focused on dinosaurs.\n\n### Step 2: Retrieve nomination details for the identified article.\n\nOnce we have identified the article, we will check the nomination page for information about the nominator.\n\nI'll now proceed with that search. \n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Fetch the Featured Articles promoted in November 2016\nurl = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles/Promoted_in_November_2016\"\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n\n# Extract articles promoted in November 2016\narticles = soup.find_all('li')\ndinosaur_articles = []\n\nfor article in articles:\n    if \"dinosaur\" in article.text.lower():\n        dinosaur_articles.append(article.text)\n\ndinosaur_articles\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to gather the dinosaur articles promoted in November 2016."}
