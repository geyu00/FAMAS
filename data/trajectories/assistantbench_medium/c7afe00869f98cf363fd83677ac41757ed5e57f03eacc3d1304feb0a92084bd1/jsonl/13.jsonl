His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as Bond.He was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II at the 2022 Queen's New Years Honours for his services to Film and Theatre.Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy\n21 wins & 83 nominations totalPhotos\n902\n+ 896\nKnown for\nNo Time to Die\n7.3\nJames Bond2021Casino Royale\n8.0\nJames Bond2006Skyfall\n7.8\nJames Bond2012Spectre\n6.8\nJames Bond2015Credits\nEdit\nMore to explore\nList\nIMDb Summer Watch Guide\nBrowse the guide\nEditorial lists\nRelated lists created by IMDb editors\nIMDb staff picks: The best movies & series of 2022\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n56 images\nWeekend box office: Nov. 24 to Nov. 27\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n10 images\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDb rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of movies featuring Daniel Craig.\n   - The IMDb ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The current availability of each of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated movie among those that meet all the criteria (IMDb rating, runtime, and Netflix availability).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, some of Daniel Craig's notable films include \"Skyfall,\" \"Casino Royale,\" \"Knives Out,\" and \"No Time to Die.\"\n   - \"Skyfall\" (2012) has a runtime of 143 minutes and an IMDb rating of 7.8.\n   - \"Casino Royale\" (2006) has a runtime of 144 minutes and an IMDb rating of 8.0.\n   - \"Knives Out\" (2019) has a runtime of 130 minutes and an IMDb rating of 7.9.\n   - \"No Time to Die\" (2021) has a runtime of 163 minutes and an IMDb rating of 7.3.\n   - \"Logan Lucky\" (2017) has a runtime of 119 minutes and an IMDb rating of 7.0.\n   - \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" (2011) has a runtime of 158 minutes and an IMDb rating of 7.8.\n   - \"The Adventures of Tintin\" (2011) has a runtime of 107 minutes and an IMDb rating of 7.3.\n   - \"Dream House\" (2011) has a runtime of 104 minutes and an IMDb rating of 6.0.\n   - \"Flashbacks of a Fool\" (2008) has a runtime of 104 minutes and an IMDb rating of 6.8.\n   - \"Munich\" (2005) has a runtime of 164 minutes and an IMDb rating of 7.5.\n   - \"Layer Cake\" (2004) has a runtime of 106 minutes and an IMDb rating of 7.4.\n   - \"Road to Perdition\" (2002) has a runtime of 128 minutes and an IMDb rating of 7.6.\n   - \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\" (2001) has a runtime of 107 minutes and an IMDb rating of 5.4.\n   - \"Our Friends in the North\" (1996) has a runtime of 360 minutes (miniseries) and an IMDb rating of 8.3.\n   - \"The Power of One\" (1992) has a runtime of 127 minutes and an IMDb rating of 7.1.\n\n5. **NEW EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - \"Knives Out\" (2019) is a strong candidate because it is highly rated (7.9), under 150 minutes (130 minutes), and is likely to be available on Netflix (US) due to its popularity and recent release.\n   - \"Layer Cake\" (2004) is another strong candidate with a good IMDb rating (7.4) and a runtime under 150 minutes (106 minutes).\n   - \"Road to Perdition\" (2002) is also a good candidate with a high IMDb rating (7.6) and a runtime under 150 minutes (128 minutes).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- \"Knives Out\" is a critically acclaimed film that fits all the criteria and is likely to be available on Netflix (US) due to its popularity and recent release.\n- \"Layer Cake\" and \"Road to Perdition\" are also strong contenders with good IMDb ratings and runtimes under 150 minutes, and they are well-known films that might be available on Netflix (US).\n\nNext steps:\n- Verify the availability of \"Knives Out,\" \"Layer Cake,\" and \"Road to Perdition\" on Netflix (US).\n- If none of these are available, check the availability of other films that meet the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incomplete Data Collection**: The initial attempts to gather the list of Daniel Craig's movies, their IMDb ratings, and runtimes were not completed. The WebSurfer did not scroll far enough to capture all the necessary information.\n2. **Lack of Structured Data Extraction**: Even when some data was visible, it was not extracted in a structured format, making it difficult to filter and analyze.\n3. **Availability Check**: The availability of the movies on Netflix (US) was not checked, which is a crucial part of the task.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Scroll to the Bottom of the Page**: Ensure that the WebSurfer scrolls to the bottom of the IMDb page to capture the complete list of Daniel Craig's movies.\n2. **Extract Structured Data**: Extract the list of movies, their IMDb ratings, and runtimes in a structured format.\n3. **Filter by Runtime**: Filter the list to include only movies that are less than 150 minutes long.\n4. **Check Netflix Availability**: Use the WebSurfer to check the current availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n5. **Identify the Highest-Rated Movie**: Identify the highest-rated movie from the filtered and available list.\n6. **Provide the Final Answer**: Provide the final answer, including the title, IMDb rating, runtime, and Netflix (US) availability.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Scroll to the Bottom of the IMDb Page**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the bottom of the page to ensure all movies are visible.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the list of Daniel Craig's movies, including their titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes.\n\n- **Step 2: Extract Structured Data**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Provide the list in a structured format, such as a table or list with each movie's title, IMDb rating, and runtime.\n\n- **Step 3: Filter by Runtime**\n  - **Assistant**: Filter the list to include only movies that are less than 150 minutes long.\n\n- **Step 4: Check Netflix Availability**\n  - **WebSurfer**: For each filtered movie, check its availability on Netflix (US).\n  - **WebSurfer**: Provide a list of movies that are available on Netflix (US) along with their titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes.\n\n- **Step 5: Identify the Highest-Rated Movie**\n  - **Assistant**: Identify the highest-rated movie from the filtered and available list.\n\n- **Step 6: Provide the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Provide the final answer, including the title, IMDb rating, runtime, and Netflix (US) availability.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Ensure Complete Data Collection**: Make sure the WebSurfer scrolls to the bottom of the page to capture all the necessary information.\n- **Structured Data Extraction**: Clearly define the format for extracting the data to ensure it is easy to filter and analyze.\n- **Double-Check Availability**: Ensure that the availability on Netflix (US) is checked for each filtered movie.\n- **Summarize and Verify**: Summarize the data at each step to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. Please scroll to the bottom of the IMDb page and provide the list of Daniel Craig's movies, including their titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes in a structured format."}
