Your answer should be a numerical integer value.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request asks about the overlap between the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies and the top 10 highest-grossing domestic movies for the year 2020.\n   - Box Office Mojo is mentioned as the source for the data.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies of 2020 according to Box Office Mojo.\n   - The top 10 highest-grossing domestic (U.S.) movies of 2020 according to Box Office Mojo.\n   - These lists can be found on the Box Office Mojo website under the 2020 box office statistics.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of movies that appear in both the top 10 worldwide and top 10 domestic lists.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on historical trends, it is likely that a significant portion of the top 10 worldwide movies will also be in the top 10 domestic list, but the exact number would need to be verified with the data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** WebSurfer will navigate to the Box Office Mojo website and locate the 2020 Worldwide Box Office list.\n- **Step 2:** WebSurfer will extract the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies from the list.\n- **Step 3:** WebSurfer will navigate to the Box Office Mojo website and locate the 2020 Domestic (U.S.) Box Office list.\n- **Step 4:** WebSurfer will extract the top 10 highest-grossing domestic movies from the list.\n- **Step 5:** Assistant will compare the two lists to determine the number of overlapping movies.\n- **Step 6:** Assistant will provide the final numerical integer value representing the number of overlapping movies."}
