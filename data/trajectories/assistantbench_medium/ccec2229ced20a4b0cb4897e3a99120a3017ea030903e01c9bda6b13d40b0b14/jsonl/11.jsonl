This suggests that the page structure or loading behavior might be causing issues.\n- **Inconsistent Page Loading**: The page might not have been fully loaded when the WebSurfer attempted to extract information, leading to missing or incomplete data.\n- **Limited Toolset**: The WebSurfer's toolset did not include a way to handle dynamic content or ensure that the page was fully loaded before attempting to extract information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Use Google Maps for Data Extraction**: Google Maps is a reliable source for finding nearby businesses and their operating hours. It often provides more structured and consistent data.\n- **Ensure Full Page Load**: Before attempting to extract information, ensure that the page is fully loaded by using the `sleep` function to wait for a few seconds.\n- **Extract Information Step-by-Step**: Break down the process into smaller, manageable steps to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n1. **Step 1: Navigate to Google Maps**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Google Maps.\n   - Search for \"restaurants near Harkness Memorial State Park, 275 Great Neck Rd, Waterford, CT 06385\".\n\n2. **Step 2: Ensure Page is Fully Loaded**\n   - Use the `sleep` function to wait for 5 seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded.\n\n3. **Step 3: Extract List of Nearby Eateries**\n   - Use WebSurfer to extract a list of nearby eateries, including their names and addresses.\n\n4. **Step 4: Extract Operating Hours**\n   - For each eatery, use WebSurfer to navigate to the individual listing and extract the operating hours, focusing on the closing times on Wednesdays.\n\n5. **Step 5: Calculate Distances**\n   - Use an online mapping service (e.g., Google Maps) to calculate the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each nearby eatery.\n\n6. **Step 6: Identify the Closest Eatery Open at 11pm on Wednesdays**\n   - Compare the distances and operating hours to identify the closest eatery that is still open at 11pm on Wednesdays.\n\n7. **Step 7: Confirm and Provide Final Answer**\n   - Confirm the final answer and provide any additional relevant details (e.g., address, type of cuisine).\n\n### Execution\n\nCan you navigate to Google Maps and search for \"restaurants near Harkness Memorial State Park, 275 Great Neck Rd, Waterford, CT 06385\"?
