{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich restaurants (not takeaway only) within 1 blocks of Washington Square Park have vegan mains for under $15?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n   - The type of restaurant is not takeaway only.\n   - The menu must include vegan mains.\n   - The price of vegan mains must be under $15.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Names and locations of restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n   - Menus and pricing of these restaurants, specifically for vegan mains.\n   - Verification that the restaurants are not takeaway only.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n     - Google Maps for restaurant locations.\n     - Restaurant websites or online menus for menu items and prices.\n     - Yelp or Google reviews for confirmation that the restaurants are not takeaway only.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which of the listed restaurants meet all the criteria (location, not takeaway only, vegan mains under $15).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the area around Washington Square Park, there are likely several dining options, including cafes and small restaurants that might offer affordable vegan options.\n   - Some popular chains or local eateries in the area might have vegan-friendly menus, but this would need to be confirmed.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for a list of restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n  - **Action:** Perform a web search using keywords like \"restaurants near Washington Square Park\" and filter results to show only those within 1 block.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Filter out takeaway-only restaurants.\n  - **Action:** Use WebSurfer to visit each restaurant’s website or Google Maps listing to confirm they have dine-in options.\n\n- **Step 3:** Identify restaurants with vegan mains.\n  - **Action:** Use WebSurfer to visit the menu pages of the remaining restaurants and look for vegan mains.\n\n- **Step 4:** Verify the price of vegan mains.\n  - **Action:** Use WebSurfer to check the prices of vegan mains on the menu pages and ensure they are under $15.\n\n- **Step 5:** Compile the final list of restaurants that meet all criteria.\n  - **Action:** Assistant will compile the information gathered by WebSurfer into a concise list of restaurants, including their names, addresses, and the specific vegan mains under $15."}

We loved it then and loved it now. This time around it was for a birthday in their private room. Service was excellent considering we were a group of 20. It still has that old world charm and elegance. This kind of ambiance and vibe has been fading in today's restaurant scene and should be cherished when you can experience it. Food was as good as I remember it. They offer a 3 course or 7 course prix fixe menu. These are some of the highlights: Tuna crudo Watermelon salad Oysters Eggplant Napoleon w burrata Beef Wellington-excellent classic Chicken Cordon Bleu Branzino Chocolate soufflé w crème anglaise Lychee panna cotta We truly enjoyed our evening and appreciated that this gem is still a very special place.\nPeta W.I had a birthday dinner here. I went for the four course prix fixe menu. It was amazing. Each mean was beautifully created, plated and paired. The ambiance was swanky, luxe, but also a rustic vibe. I say next to a window with a garden view. The restaurant was beautifully decorated with a colossal Christmas tree and ribbons along the stairs. The service was tip top, timely and I found our server yo be attentive and courteous. I was pleasantly pleased. And they cherry on top was a daintily decorated dessert platter. Can't wait to go again!\nJennifer A.If you're looking for a place to have a romantic, delicious dinner, this is it! My boyfriend and I dined here on a Friday night and everything was perfect. The restaurant is so cute and intimate with flowers and candles at each table, and the service is just incredible (our waiter checked up on us and even brought us extra ice cream with our dessert). I had the Tuna Crudo, Passionate Love cocktail, Beef Wellington, and Chocolate Soufflé. Everything was so good, but my favorite was the beef wellington. They also brought us complimentary caviar bites at the beginning of our meal, so that was definitely a nice surprise! Overall I'd recommend this spot to celebrate a special occasion and/or have a nice, intimate dinner! :)\nJosephine L.I actually came here late last year, but Yelp put a block on being able to review the place, and then I forgot to review it, and, well...etc. So, remembering as best as I can about our brunch: - Gorgeous setting - Great live jazz - Delicious pastries - Tasty entrees - Okay service (one person was blah, the other person was nicer) For what it's worth, we were seated downstairs in the middle of the main area.\nOne If By Land Two If By SeaExperience impeccable service and delicious, albeit slightly overpriced, cuisine at One If By Land Two If By Sea. This classy establishment offers a romantic ambiance, perfect for special occasions, and boasts a variety of amenities such as private dining, outdoor seating, and a full bar. Located at 17 Barrow St in New York, NY, this restaurant is a must-visit for those seeking a memorable dining experience.\nAddress: 17 Barrow St New York, NY 10014\nHandpicked for You\nNoble Crust8300 4th St N St. Petersburg, FL 33702\nThe Roof Restaurant15 E S Temple Salt Lake City, UT 84150\nGolden Duck1221 S King St Honolulu, HI 96814\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
