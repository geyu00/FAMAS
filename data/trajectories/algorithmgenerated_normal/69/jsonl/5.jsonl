Since we are unable to download the video directly, I suggest extracting the video from another available source, or we can analyze it in a different way, if possible.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a way to access the video directly for viewing, I can guide you through identifying the timestamp manually.\n\nPlease let me know how you would like to proceed!"}
