It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The video in question is located at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM\n   - The task is to determine the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously in this video.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The content of the video itself, specifically scenes where multiple bird species are visible, to count the number of species on screen at any given time.\n   - Information about the bird species featured in the video, if needed for identification, can be found in ornithological databases, birding apps, or wildlife documentaries and guides.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The highest number of bird species visible on camera simultaneously, which requires watching the video and counting the species in each scene.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Based on typical birding videos, it is likely that the number of species visible at once will be relatively low, possibly ranging from 1 to 5 species, but this is a guess and would need verification by watching the video.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Watch the Video**: Use WebSurfer to open the YouTube video and watch it to identify scenes with multiple bird species.\n- **Identify Bird Species**: While watching, use WebSurfer to pause and zoom in on scenes as needed to identify different bird species.\n- **Count Species Simultaneously**: Keep a tally of the number of distinct bird species visible on screen at any given time.\n- **Verify Identification**: If uncertain about the identity of any birds, use WebSurfer to search for images or descriptions of the birds to confirm their species.\n- **Record the Highest Count**: Note down the highest number of bird species seen simultaneously during the video.\n- **Report the Result**: Provide the final count of the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously."}

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The video in question is located at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM\n   - The task is to determine the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously in this video.\n   - The video is titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" and is produced by John Downer Productions.\n   - The video features emperor penguin chicks and Adélie penguins standing up to a giant petrel.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The content of the video itself, specifically scenes where multiple bird species are visible, to count the number of species on screen at any given time.\n   - Information about the bird species featured in the video, if needed for identification, can be found in ornithological databases, birding apps, or wildlife documentaries and guides.\n   - Specific scenes where different bird species are interacting or present together.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The highest number of bird species visible on camera simultaneously, which requires watching the video and counting the species in each scene.\n   - The exact timing and context of scenes where multiple species are visible.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Based on the title and description of the video, it is likely that the primary bird species featured are emperor penguins, Adélie penguins, and giant petrels.\n   - Given the nature of the video, which focuses on a specific interaction between these species, it is reasonable to guess that the highest number of bird species visible on camera simultaneously might be 3 (emperor penguins, Adélie penguins, and giant petrels).\n   - However, there could be other bird species in the background or in less prominent roles, so it's important to watch the entire video to verify this guess.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Guesses:**\n- The video's focus on the interaction between emperor penguins, Adélie penguins, and a giant petrel suggests that these are the main species featured.\n- Wildlife documentaries often highlight key interactions and may not show a large variety of species in a single scene, especially when the focus is on a specific event or behavior.\n- However, to ensure accuracy, it is crucial to watch the entire video and note any other bird species that may appear, even briefly.\n\nPlease proceed to play the video and watch it to identify scenes with multiple bird species. Pay attention to the number of distinct species visible on screen at any given time.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigational Error**: The WebSurfer navigated away from the intended video multiple times, leading to confusion and loss of focus on the task.\n- **Lack of Clear Instructions**: The instructions provided were not specific enough to guide the WebSurfer to stay on the correct video and focus on the task of identifying bird species.\n- **Repetition of Mistakes**: The WebSurfer repeatedly clicked on links that led away from the target video, despite being instructed to return to it.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Clear and Specific Instructions**: Provide very clear and specific instructions to ensure the WebSurfer stays on the correct video.\n- **Regular Checkpoints**: Periodically check to ensure the WebSurfer is still on the correct video and is making progress.\n- **Detailed Task Breakdown**: Break down the task into smaller, manageable steps to avoid overwhelming the WebSurfer.\n\n### New Plan in Bullet Points\n\n- **Step 1: Open the Correct Video**\n  - WebSurfer, please open the YouTube video at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n  - Ensure the video titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" is playing.\n\n- **Step 2: Watch the Video and Identify Scenes**\n  - Play the video and watch it from the beginning to the end.\n  - Pause the video whenever you see multiple bird species on screen.\n  - Take note of the species visible and the timecode of the scene.\n\n- **Step 3: Count the Number of Species**\n  - For each scene where multiple bird species are visible, count the number of distinct species.\n  - Keep a tally of the highest number of species seen simultaneously.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify Species Identification**\n  - If you are unsure about the identity of any birds, pause the video and use WebSurfer to search for images or descriptions of the birds to confirm their species.\n  - Use reliable sources such as ornithological databases, birding apps, or wildlife documentaries.\n\n- **Step 5: Record the Highest Count**\n  - Note down the highest number of bird species seen simultaneously during the video.\n\n- **Step 6: Report the Result**\n  - Provide the final count of the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously.\n\n- **Checkpoints**\n  - After every 5 minutes of video, report the current highest count and any notable scenes.\n  - If you navigate away from the video, immediately return to the correct link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n\n### Additional Hints\n\n- **Stay Focused**: Avoid clicking on any other links or recommended videos while watching the target video.\n- **Use Timecodes**: Note the timecodes of scenes with multiple species to make it easier to review or verify later.\n- **Be Thorough**: Even if the video seems straightforward, take the time to carefully observe each scene to ensure no species are missed.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM, what is the highest number of bird species to be on camera simultaneously?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The video in question is located at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM\n- The task is to determine the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously in this video.\n- The video is titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" and is produced by John Downer Productions.\n- The video features emperor penguin chicks and Adélie penguins standing up to a giant petrel.\n- The video is narrated by David Tennant and is part of the program 'Spy in the Snow' for the BBC.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The content of the video itself, specifically scenes where multiple bird species are visible, to count the number of species on screen at any given time.\n- Information about the bird species featured in the video, if needed for identification, can be found in ornithological databases, birding apps, or wildlife documentaries and guides.\n- Specific scenes where different bird species are interacting or present together.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The highest number of bird species visible on camera simultaneously, which requires watching the video and counting the species in each scene.\n- The exact timing and context of scenes where multiple species are visible.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Based on the title and description of the video, it is likely that the primary bird species featured are emperor penguins, Adélie penguins, and giant petrels.\n- Given the nature of the video, which focuses on a specific interaction between these species, it is reasonable to guess that the highest number of bird species visible on camera simultaneously might be 3 (emperor penguins, Adélie penguins, and giant petrels).\n- However, there could be other bird species in the background or in less prominent roles, so it's important to watch the entire video to verify this guess.\n- **New Educated Guess**: Since the video is set in Antarctica and features a specific interaction, it is unlikely that many other bird species will be prominently featured. However, it is possible that other seabirds such as skuas or snow petrels might appear in the background. Therefore, the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously might still be 3, but it's worth checking for any brief appearances of additional species.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Guesses:**\n- The video's focus on the interaction between emperor penguins, Adélie penguins, and a giant petrel suggests that these are the main species featured.\n- Wildlife documentaries often highlight key interactions and may not show a large variety of species in a single scene, especially when the focus is on a specific event or behavior.\n- However, to ensure accuracy, it is crucial to watch the entire video and note any other bird species that may appear, even briefly.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Step 1: Open the Correct Video**\n   - WebSurfer, please open the YouTube video at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n   - Ensure the video titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" is playing.\n\n2. **Step 2: Watch the Video and Identify Scenes**\n   - Play the video and watch it from the beginning to the end.\n   - Pause the video whenever you see multiple bird species on screen.\n   - Take note of the species visible and the timecode of the scene.\n\n3. **Step 3: Count the Number of Species**\n   - For each scene where multiple bird species are visible, count the number of distinct species.\n   - Keep a tally of the highest number of species seen simultaneously.\n\n4. **Step 4: Verify Species Identification**\n   - If you are unsure about the identity of any birds, pause the video and use WebSurfer to search for images or descriptions of the birds to confirm their species.\n   - Use reliable sources such as ornithological databases, birding apps, or wildlife documentaries.\n\n5. **Step 5: Record the Highest Count**\n   - Note down the highest number of bird species seen simultaneously during the video.\n\n6. **Step 6: Report the Result**\n   - Provide the final count of the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously.\n\n7. **Checkpoints**\n   - After every 5 minutes of video, report the current highest count and any notable scenes.\n   - If you navigate away from the video, immediately return to the correct link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n\n### Additional Hints\n\n- **Stay Focused**: Avoid clicking on any other links or recommended videos while watching the target video.\n- **Use Timecodes**: Note the timecodes of scenes with multiple species to make it easier to review or verify later.\n- **Be Thorough**: Even if the video seems straightforward, take the time to carefully observe each scene to ensure no species are missed.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigational Errors**: The WebSurfer navigated away from the intended video multiple times, leading to confusion and loss of focus on the task.\n- **Lack of Clear Instructions**: The instructions provided were not specific enough to guide the WebSurfer to stay on the correct video and focus on the task of identifying bird species.\n- **Repetition of Mistakes**: The WebSurfer repeatedly clicked on links that led away from the target video, despite being instructed to return to it.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Open the Correct Video**\n  - WebSurfer, please open the YouTube video at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n  - Ensure the video titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" is playing.\n\n- **Step 2: Watch the Video and Identify Scenes**\n  - Play the video from the beginning to the end.\n  - Pause the video whenever you see multiple bird species on screen.\n  - Take note of the species visible and the timecode of the scene.\n\n- **Step 3: Count the Number of Species**\n  - For each scene where multiple bird species are visible, count the number of distinct species.\n  - Keep a tally of the highest number of species seen simultaneously.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify Species Identification**\n  - If you are unsure about the identity of any birds, pause the video and use WebSurfer to search for images or descriptions of the birds to confirm their species.\n  - Use reliable sources such as ornithological databases, birding apps, or wildlife documentaries.\n\n- **Step 5: Record the Highest Count**\n  - Note down the highest number of bird species seen simultaneously during the video.\n\n- **Step 6: Report the Result**\n  - Provide the final count of the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously.\n\n- **Checkpoints**\n  - After every 5 minutes of video, report the current highest count and any notable scenes.\n  - If you navigate away from the video, immediately return to the correct link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n\n### Additional Hints\n\n- **Stay Focused**: Avoid clicking on any other links or recommended videos while watching the target video.\n- **Use Timecodes**: Note the timecodes of scenes with multiple species to make it easier to review or verify later.\n- **Be Thorough**: Even if the video seems straightforward, take the time to carefully observe each scene to ensure no species are missed.\n- **Double-Check Navigation**: Before starting the video, double-check that the correct video is open and playing.\n\n### Concise Plan in Bullet Points\n\n- **Open the Correct Video**\n  - WebSurfer, open the YouTube video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n  - Ensure the video titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" is playing.\n\n- **Watch and Identify Scenes**\n  - Play the video from the beginning to the end.\n  - Pause the video whenever multiple bird species are on screen.\n  - Note the species visible and the timecode of the scene.\n\n- **Count Species**\n  - Count the number of distinct species in each scene.\n  - Keep a tally of the highest number of species seen simultaneously.\n\n- **Verify Species**\n  - If unsure, pause the video and search for bird species using WebSurfer.\n  - Use reliable sources for identification.\n\n- **Record and Report**\n  - Note down the highest number of bird species seen.\n  - Report the final count and any notable scenes.\n\n- **Checkpoints**\n  - Report every 5 minutes with the current highest count.\n  - Return to the correct link if navigated away: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM, what is the highest number of bird species to be on camera simultaneously?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The video in question is located at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM\n- The task is to determine the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously in this video.\n- The video is titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" and is produced by John Downer Productions.\n- The video features emperor penguin chicks and Adélie penguins standing up to a giant petrel.\n- The video is narrated by David Tennant and is part of the program 'Spy in the Snow' for the BBC.\n- The video is 3 minutes and 32 seconds long.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The content of the video itself, specifically scenes where multiple bird species are visible, to count the number of species on screen at any given time.\n- Information about the bird species featured in the video, if needed for identification, can be found in ornithological databases, birding apps, or wildlife documentaries and guides.\n- Specific scenes where different bird species are interacting or present together.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The highest number of bird species visible on camera simultaneously, which requires watching the video and counting the species in each scene.\n- The exact timing and context of scenes where multiple species are visible.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Based on the title and description of the video, it is likely that the primary bird species featured are emperor penguins, Adélie penguins, and giant petrels.\n- Given the nature of the video, which focuses on a specific interaction between these species, it is reasonable to guess that the highest number of bird species visible on camera simultaneously might be 3 (emperor penguins, Adélie penguins, and giant petrels).\n- **Updated Educated Guess**: Since the video is set in Antarctica and features a specific interaction, it is unlikely that many other bird species will be prominently featured. However, it is possible that other seabirds such as skuas or snow petrels might appear in the background. Therefore, the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously might still be 3, but it's worth checking for any brief appearances of additional species.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Guesses:**\n- The video's focus on the interaction between emperor penguins, Adélie penguins, and a giant petrel suggests that these are the main species featured.\n- Wildlife documentaries often highlight key interactions and may not show a large variety of species in a single scene, especially when the focus is on a specific event or behavior.\n- However, to ensure accuracy, it is crucial to watch the entire video and note any other bird species that may appear, even briefly.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Step 1: Open the Correct Video**\n   - WebSurfer, please open the YouTube video at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n   - Ensure the video titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" is playing.\n\n2. **Step 2: Watch the Video and Identify Scenes**\n   - Play the video and watch it from the beginning to the end.\n   - Pause the video whenever you see multiple bird species on screen.\n   - Take note of the species visible and the timecode of the scene.\n\n3. **Step 3: Count the Number of Species**\n   - For each scene where multiple bird species are visible, count the number of distinct species.\n   - Keep a tally of the highest number of species seen simultaneously.\n\n4. **Step 4: Verify Species Identification**\n   - If you are unsure about the identity of any birds, pause the video and use WebSurfer to search for images or descriptions of the birds to confirm their species.\n   - Use reliable sources such as ornithological databases, birding apps, or wildlife documentaries.\n\n5. **Step 5: Record the Highest Count**\n   - Note down the highest number of bird species seen simultaneously during the video.\n\n6. **Step 6: Report the Result**\n   - Provide the final count of the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously.\n\n7. **Checkpoints**\n   - After every 5 minutes of video, report the current highest count and any notable scenes.\n   - If you navigate away from the video, immediately return to the correct link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n\n### Additional Hints\n\n- **Stay Focused**: Avoid clicking on any other links or recommended videos while watching the target video.\n- **Use Timecodes**: Note the timecodes of scenes with multiple species to make it easier to review or verify later.\n- **Be Thorough**: Even if the video seems straightforward, take the time to carefully observe each scene to ensure no species are missed.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigational Errors**: The WebSurfer navigated away from the intended video multiple times, leading to confusion and loss of focus on the task.\n- **Lack of Clear Instructions**: The instructions provided were not specific enough to guide the WebSurfer to stay on the correct video and focus on the task of identifying bird species.\n- **Repetition of Mistakes**: The WebSurfer repeatedly clicked on links that led away from the target video, despite being instructed to return to it.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Open the Correct Video**\n  - WebSurfer, open the YouTube video at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n  - Ensure the video titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" is playing.\n\n- **Step 2: Watch the Video and Identify Scenes**\n  - Play the video from the beginning to the end.\n  - Pause the video whenever you see multiple bird species on screen.\n  - Take note of the species visible and the timecode of the scene.\n\n- **Step 3: Count the Number of Species**\n  - For each scene where multiple bird species are visible, count the number of distinct species.\n  - Keep a tally of the highest number of species seen simultaneously.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify Species Identification**\n  - If you are unsure about the identity of any birds, pause the video and use WebSurfer to search for images or descriptions of the birds to confirm their species.\n  - Use reliable sources such as ornithological databases, birding apps, or wildlife documentaries.\n\n- **Step 5: Record the Highest Count**\n  - Note down the highest number of bird species seen simultaneously during the video.\n\n- **Step 6: Report the Result**\n  - Provide the final count of the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously.\n\n### Checkpoints\n\n- **Stay Focused**: Avoid clicking on any other links or recommended videos while watching the target video.\n- **Use Timecodes**: Note the timecodes of scenes with multiple species to make it easier to review or verify later.\n- **Be Thorough**: Even if the video seems straightforward, take the time to carefully observe each scene to ensure no species are missed.\n- **Double-Check Navigation**: Before starting the video, double-check that the correct video is open and playing.\n- **Report Every 5 Minutes**: After every 5 minutes of video, report the current highest count and any notable scenes.\n- **Immediate Return**: If you navigate away from the video, immediately return to the correct link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n\n### Concise Plan in Bullet Points\n\n- **Open the Correct Video**\n  - WebSurfer, open the YouTube video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n  - Ensure the video titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" is playing.\n\n- **Watch and Identify Scenes**\n  - Play the video from the beginning to the end.\n  - Pause the video whenever multiple bird species are on screen.\n  - Note the species visible and the timecode of the scene.\n\n- **Count Species**\n  - Count the number of distinct species in each scene.\n  - Keep a tally of the highest number of species seen simultaneously.\n\n- **Verify Species**\n  - If unsure, pause the video and search for bird species using WebSurfer.\n  - Use reliable sources for identification.\n\n- **Record and Report**\n  - Note down the highest number of bird species seen.\n  - Report the final count and any notable scenes.\n\n- **Checkpoints**\n  - Report every 5 minutes with the current highest count.\n  - Return to the correct link if navigated away: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n  - Double-check navigation before starting the video.\n  - Stay focused and avoid other links or recommended videos.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM, what is the highest number of bird species to be on camera simultaneously?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The video in question is located at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM\n- The task is to determine the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously in this video.\n- The video is titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" and is produced by John Downer Productions.\n- The video features emperor penguin chicks and Adélie penguins standing up to a giant petrel.\n- The video is narrated by David Tennant and is part of the program 'Spy in the Snow' for the BBC.\n- The video is 3 minutes and 32 seconds long.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The content of the video itself, specifically scenes where multiple bird species are visible, to count the number of species on screen at any given time.\n- Information about the bird species featured in the video, if needed for identification, can be found in ornithological databases, birding apps, or wildlife documentaries and guides.\n- Specific scenes where different bird species are interacting or present together.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The highest number of bird species visible on camera simultaneously, which requires watching the video and counting the species in each scene.\n- The exact timing and context of scenes where multiple species are visible.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Based on the title and description of the video, it is likely that the primary bird species featured are emperor penguins, Adélie penguins, and giant petrels.\n- Given the nature of the video, which focuses on a specific interaction between these species, it is reasonable to guess that the highest number of bird species visible on camera simultaneously might be 3 (emperor penguins, Adélie penguins, and giant petrels).\n- **Updated Educated Guess**: Since the video is set in Antarctica and features a specific interaction, it is unlikely that many other bird species will be prominently featured. However, it is possible that other seabirds such as skuas or snow petrels might appear in the background. Therefore, the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously might still be 3, but it's worth checking for any brief appearances of additional species.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Guesses:**\n- The video's focus on the interaction between emperor penguins, Adélie penguins, and a giant petrel suggests that these are the main species featured.\n- Wildlife documentaries often highlight key interactions and may not show a large variety of species in a single scene, especially when the focus is on a specific event or behavior.\n- However, to ensure accuracy, it is crucial to watch the entire video and note any other bird species that may appear, even briefly.\n- **Additional Consideration**: Given the short duration of the video (3 minutes and 32 seconds), the likelihood of multiple species appearing simultaneously is reduced, but it's still important to verify this by watching the video thoroughly.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Step 1: Open the Correct Video**\n   - WebSurfer, please open the YouTube video at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n   - Ensure the video titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" is playing.\n\n2. **Step 2: Watch the Video and Identify Scenes**\n   - Play the video and watch it from the beginning to the end.\n   - Pause the video whenever you see multiple bird species on screen.\n   - Take note of the species visible and the timecode of the scene.\n\n3. **Step 3: Count the Number of Species**\n   - For each scene where multiple bird species are visible, count the number of distinct species.\n   - Keep a tally of the highest number of species seen simultaneously.\n\n4. **Step 4: Verify Species Identification**\n   - If you are unsure about the identity of any birds, pause the video and use WebSurfer to search for images or descriptions of the birds to confirm their species.\n   - Use reliable sources such as ornithological databases, birding apps, or wildlife documentaries.\n\n5. **Step 5: Record the Highest Count**\n   - Note down the highest number of bird species seen simultaneously during the video.\n\n6. **Step 6: Report the Result**\n   - Provide the final count of the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously.\n\n### Checkpoints\n- **Stay Focused**: Avoid clicking on any other links or recommended videos while watching the target video.\n- **Use Timecodes**: Note the timecodes of scenes with multiple species to make it easier to review or verify later.\n- **Be Thorough**: Even if the video seems straightforward, take the time to carefully observe each scene to ensure no species are missed.\n- **Report Every 5 Minutes**: After every 5 minutes of video, report the current highest count and any notable scenes.\n- **Immediate Return**: If you navigate away from the video, immediately return to the correct link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n\n### Additional Hints\n- **Stay Focused**: Avoid clicking on any other links or recommended videos while watching the target video.\n- **Use Timecodes**: Note the timecodes of scenes with multiple species to make it easier to review or verify later.\n- **Be Thorough**: Even if the video seems straightforward, take the time to carefully observe each scene to ensure no species are missed.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigational Errors**: The WebSurfer repeatedly navigated away from the intended video to other YouTube videos, despite being instructed to return to the correct link.\n- **Lack of Clear Instructions**: The instructions provided were not specific enough to guide the WebSurfer to stay on the correct video and focus on the task of identifying bird species.\n- **Repetition of Mistakes**: The WebSurfer continued to click on links that led away from the target video, even after being reminded to return to the correct link.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Open the Correct Video**\n  - WebSurfer, open the YouTube video at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n  - Ensure the video titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" is playing.\n  - **Hint**: Double-check the URL in the address bar to ensure it is exactly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n\n- **Step 2: Watch the Video and Identify Scenes**\n  - Play the video from the beginning to the end.\n  - Pause the video whenever you see multiple bird species on screen.\n  - Take note of the species visible and the timecode of the scene.\n  - **Hint**: Avoid clicking on any other links or recommended videos. Focus solely on the current video.\n\n- **Step 3: Count the Number of Species**\n  - For each scene where multiple bird species are visible, count the number of distinct species.\n  - Keep a tally of the highest number of species seen simultaneously.\n  - **Hint**: Write down the species and timecodes to keep track of your observations.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify Species Identification**\n  - If you are unsure about the identity of any birds, pause the video and use WebSurfer to search for images or descriptions of the birds to confirm their species.\n  - Use reliable sources such as ornithological databases, birding apps, or wildlife documentaries.\n  - **Hint**: Search for \"Antarctic bird species\" or specific names if you need help with identification.\n\n- **Step 5: Record the Highest Count**\n  - Note down the highest number of bird species seen simultaneously during the video.\n  - **Hint**: Keep a running total of the highest count as you watch the video.\n\n- **Step 6: Report the Result**\n  - Provide the final count of the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously.\n  - **Hint**: Report the result once you have watched the entire video and confirmed your observations.\n\n### Checkpoints\n- **Stay Focused**: Avoid clicking on any other links or recommended videos while watching the target video.\n- **Use Timecodes**: Note the timecodes of scenes with multiple species to make it easier to review or verify later.\n- **Be Thorough**: Even if the video seems straightforward, take the time to carefully observe each scene to ensure no species are missed.\n- **Report Every 5 Minutes**: After every 5 minutes of video, report the current highest count and any notable scenes.\n- **Immediate Return**: If you navigate away from the video, immediately return to the correct link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n- **Double-Check Navigation**: Before starting the video, double-check that the correct video is open and playing.\n\n### Concise Plan in Bullet Points\n\n- **Open the Correct Video**\n  - WebSurfer, open the YouTube video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n  - Ensure the video titled \"Penguin Chicks Stand Up To Giant Petrel...With The Help of a Friend!\" is playing.\n  - Double-check the URL in the address bar.\n\n- **Watch and Identify Scenes**\n  - Play the video from the beginning to the end.\n  - Pause the video whenever multiple bird species are on screen.\n  - Note the species visible and the timecode of the scene.\n  - Avoid clicking on any other links or recommended videos.\n\n- **Count Species**\n  - Count the number of distinct species in each scene.\n  - Keep a tally of the highest number of species seen simultaneously.\n  - Write down the species and timecodes.\n\n- **Verify Species**\n  - If unsure, pause the video and search for bird species using WebSurfer.\n  - Use reliable sources for identification.\n\n- **Record and Report**\n  - Note down the highest number of bird species seen.\n  - Report the final count and any notable scenes.\n\n- **Checkpoints**\n  - Report every 5 minutes with the current highest count.\n  - Return to the correct link if navigated away: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n  - Double-check navigation before starting the video.\n  - Stay focused and avoid other links or recommended videos.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}
