{"agent": "DataAnalysis_Expert", "content": "To tackle the task effectively, we need to begin by reviewing the provided sample dataset to confirm its representativeness regarding the criteria specifiedâ€”namely, the focus on houses sold in Prince Edward Island with at least 2 beds and 2 baths between June 1, 2022, and May 15, 2024.\n\n### Step 1: Review the Sample Dataset\n1. **Check the dataset:** We need to load the dataset and examine its structure, including the column names and data types, to ensure that it contains the necessary fields such as 'square footage', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sale date', and 'location'.\n2. **Filtering criteria:** Ensure that the dataset has houses that meet the minimum requirements (2 beds and 2 baths) and fall within the specified date range.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Function for Finding the Smallest House\n1. **Function Definition:** The function should filter the dataset based on the specified criteria.\n2. **Correctness:** Verify that the function correctly identifies the smallest house by checking its output against a manual calculation or another reliable method.\n\nLet's proceed by executing the necessary Python code to review the sample dataset and verify the function used to identify the smallest house. Please provide the CSV file path to begin."}
