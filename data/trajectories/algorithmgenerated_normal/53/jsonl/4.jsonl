Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nDetermine the number of High Energy Physics - Lattice articles listed in January 2020 on Arxiv that had ps versions available.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Extract the list of High Energy Physics - Lattice articles from Arxiv for January 2020.\n2. Analyze the extracted data to identify which articles have ps versions available.\n3. Count the number of articles with ps versions available.\n\n## Output format\nThe output should be a single integer representing the number of articles with ps versions available.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The data should be accurately extracted from Arxiv for the specified category and time period.\n- The analysis should correctly identify and count the articles with ps versions available.\n\n## Results from last response\n0\n\n## Reason for the results\nNo High Energy Physics - Lattice articles were found for January 2020 on Arxiv, and thus none of these articles had ps versions available."}
