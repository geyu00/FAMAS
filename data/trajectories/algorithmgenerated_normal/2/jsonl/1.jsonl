If there's a tie for a number of athletes, return the first in alphabetical order. Give the IOC country code as your answer. Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify the country with the least number of athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics. If there is a tie, return the first country in alphabetical order. Provide the IOC country code as the answer.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Collect the list of countries and the number of athletes they sent to the 1928 Summer Olympics.\n2. Determine the country with the least number of athletes.\n3.

{"agent": "DataAnalysis_Expert", "content": "To solve the task, I will first need to ingest and analyze a dataset containing the number of athletes from various countries who participated in the 1928 Summer Olympics. \n\nHere’s the plan in detail:\n\n1. **Collect the Dataset**: I'll need to load a CSV file that contains information about countries and their respective athlete counts for the 1928 Olympics.\n2. **Data Manipulation**: Using the pandas library, I'll group the data by country, count the number of athletes, and identify the country with the least number of athletes.\n3. **Handle Ties**: If multiple countries have the same minimum number of athletes, I will sort those countries alphabetically and select the first one.\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, I will extract and return the IOC country code for the selected country.\n\nNow, let's proceed to the first step of loading the dataset. If you can provide me with the dataset or the path to the CSV file, I can create and execute the code to find the required result."}
