I will calculate the total number of wheels for these configurations.\n\nLet’s define the wheel counts for each steam locomotive configuration:\n\n- 0-4-0: 4 wheels\n- 4-4-0: 8 wheels\n- 2-6-0: 8 wheels\n- 2-8-0: 10 wheels\n- 2-6-4: 12 wheels\n- 2-8-4: 14 wheels\n\nNow I will implement the calculation in the next code block.

{"agent": "CSVProcessing_Expert", "content": "It looks like the variable `wheel_configurations` was not defined in the new code block. This is because we need to run the entire context within the same code block, including the loading of the Excel file and the definition of `wheel_configurations`.\n\nI will combine both parts into a single code block that defines `wheel_configurations` and calculates the total wheels accordingly. Here’s the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the Excel file\nfile_path = \"../2023/validation/54612da3-fd56-4941-80f4-5eb82330de25.xlsx\"\ndata = pd.read_excel(file_path)\n\n# Extract the 'Type/Wheel Configuration' column\nwheel_configurations = data['Type/Wheel Configuration'].dropna().unique()\n\n# Define the wheel count for steam locomotive configurations\nwheel_count = {\n    '0-4-0': 4,\n    '4-4-0': 8,\n    '2-6-0': 8,\n    '2-8-0': 10,\n    '2-6-4': 12,\n    '2-8-4': 14\n}\n\n# Calculate the total number of wheels for the steam locomotives\ntotal_wheels = sum(wheel_count[config] for config in wheel_configurations if config in wheel_count)\n\n# Display the total number of wheels\nprint(total_wheels)\n```\n\nI'll now run this code in the Computer_terminal."}
