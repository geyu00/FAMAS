Introduction Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio flashes of millisecond duration (Lorimer et al. 2007; Petroff et al. 2019; Cordes & Chatterjee 2019) located at cosmological distances. Hundreds of these events have now been discovered (CHIME/FRB Collaboration 2021a), and yet their progenitor systems remain unknown.The fast radio burst FRB 20201124A in a star-forming region How many FRB bursts were detected?\nFAST carried out a 55-day observational campaign starting from April 1, 2021, soon after the CHIME alert (CHIME/FRB Collaboration 2021b). More than 1600 FRB bursts were detected in the 1.0-1.5 GHz frequency band. The details of FAST observations will be reported in a separate paper (H. Xu et al. 2021, in preparation).The fast radio burst FRB 20201124A in a star-forming region What is the limit for X-ray bursts in coincidence with FRB?\nThe most constraining limit for X-ray bursts in coincidence with FRB is EX ≲ 1.6 × 10 45 erg for a single burst in FRB 20180916B and EX ≲ 1.1 × 10 44 erg in FRB 20201124A, assuming that all FRBs have an associated X-ray burst.The fast radio burst FRB 20201124A in a star-forming region Are X-ray bursts associated with FRB?\nOverall, the most constraining observations for X-ray bursts in coincidence with FRB is EX ≲ 1.6 × 10 45 erg for a single burst in FRB 20180916B and EX ≲ 1.1 × 10 44 erg in FRB 20201124A, assuming that all FRBs have an associated X-ray burstThe fast radio burst FRB 20201124A in a star-forming region What is the upper limit of X-ray burst energy?\nFor an X-ray burst arriving at the time of an FRB, we obtain an upper limit of 14 counts (at 5 sigma; Kraft et al. 1991), which corresponds to an upper limit of F (2−10keV) = 2.5 × 10 −10 erg cm −2 on the fluence, and of E =  on the X-ray burst energy, assuming the X-ray spectrum described in Appendix B.The fast radio burst FRB 20201124A in a star-forming region\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"SystemEntropyOriginTrialToken\": \"A5is4nwJJVnhaJpUr1URgj4vvAXSiHoK0VBbM9fawMskbDUj9WUREpa3JzGAo6xd1Cp2voQEG1h6NQ71AsMznU8AAABxeyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaW5nLmNvbTo0NDMiLCJmZWF0dXJlIjoiTXNVc2VyQWdlbnRMYXVuY2hOYXZUeXBlIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNzUzNzQ3MjAwLCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZX0=\",\n        \"ConfidenceOriginTrialToken\": \"Aqw360MHzRcmtEVv55zzdIWcTk2BBYHcdBAOysNJZP4qkN8M+5vUq36ITHFVst8LiX36KBZJXB8xvyBgdK2z5Q0AAAB6eyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL2JpbmcuY29tOjQ0MyIsImZlYXR1cmUiOiJQZXJmb3JtYW5jZU5hdmlnYXRpb25UaW1pbmdDb25maWRlbmNlIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNzYwNDAwMDAwLCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZX0=\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Bing \\u7684\\u667a\\u6167\\u578b\\u641c\\u5c0b\\u53ef\\u8b93\\u60a8\\u66f4\\u8f15\\u800c\\u6613\\u8209\\u627e\\u5230\\u60f3\\u627e\\u7684\\u8cc7\\u8a0a\\uff0c\\u540c\\u6642\\u9084\\u56e0\\u6b64\\u7372\\u5f97\\u734e\\u52f5\\u3002\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Bing\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts March 2021 AND Fast radio bursts paper July 2020 - Bing\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.bing.com/search?q=Multiwavelength+observations+of+fast+radio+bursts+March+2021+AND+Fast+radio+bursts+paper+July+2020&FORM=QBLH\",\n        \"fb:app_id\": \"3732605936979161\",\n        \"og:image\": \"http://www.bing.com/sa/simg/facebook_sharing_5.png\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"600\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"315\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks to be the only viable strategy.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - The paper included a diagram of an X-ray time profile.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper by one of the same authors from July 2020.\n   - The user wants to know the difference in seconds between the measured time spans of the two diagrams.\n   - The March 2021 paper (arXiv:2103.07786) has been downloaded and is available as a PDF.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact measured time span of the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact measured time span of the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - Both papers are available on Arxiv, so these details can be found by locating and reviewing the relevant sections of each paper.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans can be derived by subtracting the time span from the July 2020 paper from the time span from the March 2021 paper.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The difference in seconds could be significant if the bursts were observed under different conditions or with different instruments.\n   - The time spans might be in the range of milliseconds to seconds, as fast radio bursts are known for their brief duration.\n   - The X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper is likely to be discussed in the context of multiwavelength observations, which might provide additional context for the time span.\n   - The burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper might be part of a study focusing on the temporal characteristics of fast radio bursts, which could help in identifying the measured time span.\n\n**NEW HUNCHES AND REASONING**\n- **Hunch 1:** The X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper might be mentioned in the methods or results section, as these sections typically detail the specific measurements and observations. This could help in quickly locating the relevant information.\n- **Hunch 2:** The burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper might be part of a broader study on the temporal properties of fast radio bursts. Checking the abstract and introduction of the paper could provide clues about the focus and the type of measurements taken.\n- **Hunch 3:** Since both papers are by the same author(s), there might be consistent terminology or methodologies used across the studies. This could help in cross-referencing and understanding the context of the measurements.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps:\n1. Open the March 2021 paper (arXiv:2103.07786) and search for the X-ray time profile diagram and its measured time span.\n2. Locate the July 2020 paper and search for the burst-1 diagram and its measured time span.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Inefficient Navigation and Information Extraction**: The previous attempts to navigate through the March 2021 paper and extract the X-ray time profile diagram and its measured time span were not systematic. The focus was on scrolling through the webpage without a clear strategy to locate the specific information.\n- **Lack of Direct PDF Interaction**: Although the PDF of the March 2021 paper was downloaded, we did not directly interact with the PDF to search for the required information. Using the PDF format would allow for more precise and efficient searching.\n- **Incomplete Search Strategy**: The search for the July 2020 paper was not completed, and there was no clear plan for how to locate and extract the measured time span from that paper.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Open and Search the March 2021 Paper PDF**:\n   - **FileSurfer**: Open the PDF file `2103.07786v2.pdf` and search for keywords such as \"X-ray time profile\", \"X-ray diagram\", \"time span\", and \"duration\".\n   - **Extract the Measured Time Span**: Identify the section containing the X-ray time profile diagram and extract the measured time span in seconds.\n\n2. **Locate and Download the July 2020 Paper**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the July 2020 paper by one of the same authors on Arxiv.\n   - **Download the PDF**: Once the paper is found, download the PDF.\n\n3. **Open and Search the July 2020 Paper PDF**:\n   - **FileSurfer**: Open the downloaded PDF and search for keywords such as \"burst-1 diagram\", \"time span\", and \"duration\".\n   - **Extract the Measured Time Span**: Identify the section containing the burst-1 diagram and extract the measured time span in seconds.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - **Assistant**: Calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n\n5. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final answer, which is the difference in seconds.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Open and Search the March 2021 Paper PDF**:\n   - **FileSurfer**: Open `2103.07786v2.pdf`.\n   - **FileSurfer**: Search for \"X-ray time profile\" and \"X-ray diagram\".\n   - **FileSurfer**: Extract the measured time span in seconds from the relevant section or diagram.\n\n2. **Locate and Download the July 2020 Paper**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Fast radio bursts paper July 2020\" on Arxiv.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the relevant paper and download the PDF.\n\n3. **Open and Search the July 2020 Paper PDF**:\n   - **FileSurfer**: Open the downloaded PDF.\n   - **FileSurfer**: Search for \"burst-1 diagram\" and \"time span\".\n   - **FileSurfer**: Extract the measured time span in seconds from the relevant section or diagram.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - **Assistant**: Subtract the time span from the July 2020 paper from the time span from the March 2021 paper.\n\n5. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final answer, which is the difference in seconds.\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to efficiently locate and extract the required information from both papers and provide the user with the correct answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - The paper included a diagram of an X-ray time profile.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper by one of the same authors from July 2020.\n   - The user wants to know the difference in seconds between the measured time spans of the two diagrams.\n   - The March 2021 paper (arXiv:2103.07786) has been downloaded and is available as a PDF.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact measured time span of the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact measured time span of the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - Both papers are available on Arxiv, so these details can be found by locating and reviewing the relevant sections of each paper.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans can be derived by subtracting the time span from the July 2020 paper from the time span from the March 2021 paper.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The difference in seconds could be significant if the bursts were observed under different conditions or with different instruments.\n   - The time spans might be in the range of milliseconds to seconds, as fast radio bursts are known for their brief duration.\n   - The X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper is likely to be discussed in the context of multiwavelength observations, which might provide additional context for the time span.\n   - The burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper might be part of a study focusing on the temporal characteristics of fast radio bursts, which could help in identifying the measured time span.\n\n**NEW HUNCHES AND REASONING**\n- **Hunch 1:** The X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper might be mentioned in the methods or results section, as these sections typically detail the specific measurements and observations. This could help in quickly locating the relevant information.\n- **Hunch 2:** The burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper might be part of a broader study on the temporal properties of fast radio bursts. Checking the abstract and introduction of the paper could provide clues about the focus and the type of measurements taken.\n- **Hunch 3:** Since both papers are by the same author(s), there might be consistent terminology or methodologies used across the studies. This could help in cross-referencing and understanding the context of the measurements.\n- **Hunch 4:** The X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper might be associated with a specific event or observation, such as a particular FRB source. Identifying this event could help in narrowing down the relevant section of the paper.\n- **Hunch 5:** The burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper might be part of a series of observations or a case study. Looking for references to specific observations or case studies could help in finding the measured time span.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Open the March 2021 Paper (arXiv:2103.07786) and Search for the X-ray Time Profile Diagram and Its Measured Time Span**\n   - Use the PDF viewer to search for keywords like 'X-ray time profile', 'X-ray diagram', 'time span', and 'duration'.\n   - Focus on the methods and results sections, as these are likely to contain the detailed measurements.\n\n2. **Locate the July 2020 Paper and Search for the Burst-1 Diagram and Its Measured Time Span**\n   - Use the Arxiv website to find the July 2020 paper.\n   - Download the PDF and search for keywords like 'burst-1 diagram', 'time span', and 'duration'.\n   - Check the abstract and introduction for context and focus on the methods and results sections.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds**\n   - Once the measured time spans are identified, calculate the difference by subtracting the time span from the July 2020 paper from the time span from the March 2021 paper.\n\n4. **Provide the Final Answer**\n   - Provide the final answer, which is the difference in seconds.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n### Step 1: Open the March 2021 Paper and Search for the X-ray Time Profile Diagram and Its Measured Time Span\n\nFileSurfer, please open the PDF file `2103.07786v2.pdf` and search for the keywords 'X-ray time profile', 'X-ray diagram', 'time span', and 'duration'. Identify the section containing the X-ray time profile diagram and extract the measured time span in seconds.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Inefficient Keyword Search**: The keyword search in the PDF did not yield the specific information needed. The search might have missed the relevant sections or the keywords might not have been precise enough.\n- **Lack of Contextual Search**: The search did not focus on specific sections of the paper where the X-ray time profile and its measured time span are likely to be mentioned (e.g., methods, results, figures).\n- **Manual Review Overlooked**: The manual review of the PDF did not systematically check each section, leading to potential oversight of the relevant information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Keyword Search**:\n   - Use more specific and context-related keywords to search for the X-ray time profile and its measured time span.\n   - Keywords: \"X-ray time profile\", \"X-ray diagram\", \"time span\", \"duration\", \"measurement\", \"observation\", \"figure\", \"results\", \"methods\".\n\n2. **Systematic Section Review**:\n   - Start with the **Introduction** and **Abstract** to get an overview of the paper.\n   - Focus on the **Methods** and **Results** sections, as these are likely to contain the detailed measurements.\n   - Check the **Figures** and their captions for the X-ray time profile diagram and any associated time span information.\n\n3. **Extract and Verify Information**:\n   - Once the relevant section is identified, extract the measured time span in seconds.\n   - Verify the extracted information by cross-referencing with nearby text and figures.\n\n4. **Locate and Download the July 2020 Paper**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to search for the July 2020 paper by one of the same authors.\n   - Download the PDF and repeat the systematic search process for the burst-1 diagram and its measured time span.\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Subtract the time span from the July 2020 paper from the time span from the March 2021 paper.\n\n6. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Provide the final answer, which is the difference in seconds.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Refine Keyword Search**:\n   - FileSurfer, open the PDF file `2103.07786v2.pdf`.\n   - Search for the keywords \"X-ray time profile\", \"X-ray diagram\", \"time span\", \"duration\", \"measurement\", \"observation\", \"figure\", \"results\", \"methods\".\n\n2. **Systematic Section Review**:\n   - Start with the **Introduction** and **Abstract**.\n   - Move to the **Methods** and **Results** sections.\n   - Check the **Figures** and their captions.\n\n3. **Extract and Verify Information**:\n   - Identify the section containing the X-ray time profile diagram.\n   - Extract the measured time span in seconds.\n   - Verify the extracted information.\n\n4. **Locate and Download the July 2020 Paper**:\n   - WebSurfer, search for \"Fast radio bursts paper July 2020\" on Arxiv.\n   - Click on the relevant paper and download the PDF.\n\n5. **Repeat Systematic Search for the July 2020 Paper**:\n   - FileSurfer, open the downloaded PDF.\n   - Repeat the systematic search process for the burst-1 diagram and its measured time span.\n\n6. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Assistant, calculate the difference in seconds.\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Assistant, provide the final answer.\n\nLet's start with the refined keyword search:\n\n### Step 1: Refine Keyword Search\n\nFileSurfer, please open the PDF file `2103.07786v2.pdf` and search for the keywords \"X-ray time profile\", \"X-ray diagram\", \"time span\", \"duration\", \"measurement\", \"observation\", \"figure\", \"results\", \"methods\".

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - The paper included a diagram of an X-ray time profile.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper by one of the same authors from July 2020.\n   - The user wants to know the difference in seconds between the measured time spans of the two diagrams.\n   - The March 2021 paper (arXiv:2103.07786) has been downloaded and is available as a PDF.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact measured time span of the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact measured time span of the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - Both papers are available on Arxiv, so these details can be found by locating and reviewing the relevant sections of each paper.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans can be derived by subtracting the time span from the July 2020 paper from the time span from the March 2021 paper.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The difference in seconds could be significant if the bursts were observed under different conditions or with different instruments.\n   - The time spans might be in the range of milliseconds to seconds, as fast radio bursts are known for their brief duration.\n   - The X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper is likely to be discussed in the context of multiwavelength observations, which might provide additional context for the time span.\n   - The burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper might be part of a study focusing on the temporal characteristics of fast radio bursts, which could help in identifying the measured time span.\n\n**NEW HUNCHES AND REASONING**\n- **Hunch 1:** The X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper might be mentioned in the methods or results section, as these sections typically detail the specific measurements and observations. This could help in quickly locating the relevant information.\n- **Hunch 2:** The burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper might be part of a broader study on the temporal properties of fast radio bursts. Checking the abstract and introduction of the paper could provide clues about the focus and the type of measurements taken.\n- **Hunch 3:** Since both papers are by the same author(s), there might be consistent terminology or methodologies used across the studies. This could help in cross-referencing and understanding the context of the measurements.\n- **Hunch 4:** The X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper might be associated with a specific event or observation, such as a particular FRB source. Identifying this event could help in narrowing down the relevant section of the paper.\n- **Hunch 5:** The burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper might be part of a series of observations or a case study. Looking for references to specific observations or case studies could help in finding the measured time span.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Open the March 2021 Paper (arXiv:2103.07786) and Search for the X-ray Time Profile Diagram and Its Measured Time Span**\n   - Use the PDF viewer to search for keywords like 'X-ray time profile', 'X-ray diagram', 'time span', and 'duration'.\n   - Focus on the methods and results sections, as these are likely to contain the detailed measurements.\n\n2. **Locate the July 2020 Paper and Search for the Burst-1 Diagram and Its Measured Time Span**\n   - Use the Arxiv website to find the July 2020 paper.\n   - Download the PDF and search for keywords like 'burst-1 diagram', 'time span', and 'duration'.\n   - Check the abstract and introduction for context and focus on the methods and results sections.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds**\n   - Once the measured time spans are identified, calculate the difference by subtracting the time span from the July 2020 paper from the time span from the March 2021 paper.\n\n4. **Provide the Final Answer**\n   - Provide the final answer, which is the difference in seconds.\n\n### Step 1: Open the March 2021 Paper and Search for the X-ray Time Profile Diagram and Its Measured Time Span\n\nFileSurfer, please open the PDF file `2103.07786v2.pdf` and search for the keywords 'X-ray time profile', 'X-ray diagram', 'time span', and 'duration'.
