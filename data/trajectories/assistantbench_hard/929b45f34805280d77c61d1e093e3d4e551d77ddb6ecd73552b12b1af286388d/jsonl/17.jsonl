What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The exact location or database where these files can be accessed.\n   - The update history of the dog genome mapping to identify the most recent version as of May 2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific facts need to be derived from the information provided.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files in May 2020 are likely to be part of a major update or release around that time.\n   - The files are probably hosted on a genomic database such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or Ensembl.\n   - The version number of the dog genome assembly might be something like CanFam3.1 or a similar iteration, given the timeline.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** WebSurfer will search for the most relevant version of the dog genome assembly as of May 2020.\n  - **Action:** Perform a web search using terms like \"dog genome assembly May 2020\" and \"CanFam3.1\" or similar version numbers.\n  - **Goal:** Identify the specific version of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020 and the source database (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl).\n\n- **Step 2:** WebSurfer will navigate to the identified database and locate the download page for the relevant genome files.\n  - **Action:** Open the identified database website and navigate to the section containing the dog genome assembly files.\n  - **Goal:** Find the direct link to the files or the FTP directory where the files can be downloaded.\n\n- **Step 3:** WebSurfer will verify the link and ensure it points to the correct files.\n  - **Action:** Click on the link to ensure it leads to the correct file or directory.\n  - **Goal:** Confirm that the link is functional and points to the most relevant genome files as of May 2020.\n\n- **Step 4:** Assistant will compile the final answer, including the verified link to the genome files.\n  - **Action:** Summarize the findings and provide the verified link.\n  - **Goal:** Present the final answer to the original request."}

By aligning short read data from 58 representative dog breeds to three reference genomes, we demonstrate how the choice of reference genome significantly impacts both read mapping and variant detection.Does a reference genome affect genetic variation in dogs?\nMany canine CNVs were shown to effect protein coding genes, including disease and candidate disease genes, and are thus likely to be functional. In this study, we find How can we drive canine comparative genomics forward?\nTo drive canine comparative genomics forward, we generated a high-quality canine reference assembly using a combination of Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long read sequencing, 10x Genomics Chromium Linked Reads (henceforth called 10x) and HiC proximity ligation.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"SystemEntropyOriginTrialToken\": \"A5is4nwJJVnhaJpUr1URgj4vvAXSiHoK0VBbM9fawMskbDUj9WUREpa3JzGAo6xd1Cp2voQEG1h6NQ71AsMznU8AAABxeyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaW5nLmNvbTo0NDMiLCJmZWF0dXJlIjoiTXNVc2VyQWdlbnRMYXVuY2hOYXZUeXBlIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNzUzNzQ3MjAwLCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZX0=\",\n        \"ConfidenceOriginTrialToken\": \"Aqw360MHzRcmtEVv55zzdIWcTk2BBYHcdBAOysNJZP4qkN8M+5vUq36ITHFVst8LiX36KBZJXB8xvyBgdK2z5Q0AAAB6eyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL2JpbmcuY29tOjQ0MyIsImZlYXR1cmUiOiJQZXJmb3JtYW5jZU5hdmlnYXRpb25UaW1pbmdDb25maWRlbmNlIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNzYwNDAwMDAwLCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZX0=\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Bing \\u7684\\u667a\\u6167\\u578b\\u641c\\u5c0b\\u53ef\\u8b93\\u60a8\\u66f4\\u8f15\\u800c\\u6613\\u8209\\u627e\\u5230\\u60f3\\u627e\\u7684\\u8cc7\\u8a0a\\uff0c\\u540c\\u6642\\u9084\\u56e0\\u6b64\\u7372\\u5f97\\u734e\\u52f5\\u3002\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Bing\",\n        \"og:title\": \"dog genome assembly May 2020 CanFam3.1 - Bing\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.bing.com/search?q=dog+genome+assembly+May+2020+CanFam3.1&form=QBLH&sp=-1&lq=0&pq=&sc=0-0&qs=n&sk=&cvid=4D7D44EEAD884B778D980B6A16C13803\",\n        \"fb:app_id\": \"3732605936979161\",\n        \"og:image\": \"http://www.bing.com/sa/simg/facebook_sharing_5.png\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"600\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"315\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe dog genome was first mapped in 2004 and has been updated several times since. What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The most relevant version of the dog genome assembly as of May 2020 is CanFam3.1.\n   - The CanFam3.1 genome assembly is available on the NCBI and Ensembl databases.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact location or directory on the Ensembl FTP site where the CanFam3.1 dog genome assembly files can be accessed.\n   - The specific types of files available for download (e.g., FASTA, GTF, GFF3).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific facts need to be derived from the information provided.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files in May 2020 are likely to be part of a major update or release around that time.\n   - The files are probably hosted on a genomic database such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or Ensembl.\n   - The version number of the dog genome assembly is CanFam3.1, which was a significant improvement over previous versions.\n   - The Ensembl FTP site likely has a structured directory for different species and genome versions, and the CanFam3.1 files should be located in a subdirectory under `/pub/release-XX/fasta/canis_lupus_familiaris/dna/` or a similar path.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Version Number**: We have confirmed that CanFam3.1 is the most relevant version as of May 2020.\n- **Directory Structure**: Based on the typical structure of genomic databases, the Ensembl FTP site is likely to have a consistent directory structure for different species and genome versions. The CanFam3.1 files are expected to be in a subdirectory dedicated to the dog genome and the specific version.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Navigate to the Ensembl FTP site and locate the directory for CanFam3.1.\n- Provide the direct link to the files for the CanFam3.1 dog genome assembly.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: The previous attempts involved navigating to the Ensembl FTP site but did not correctly identify the specific directory for the CanFam3.1 dog genome assembly.\n- **Lack of Specific Directory Path**: The search and navigation did not focus on the specific directory structure that Ensembl uses for different species and genome versions.\n- **Repetition of Steps**: The same steps were repeated without adjusting the approach to directly access the required files.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Directly Access the Ensembl FTP Site**\n  - **Action**: Navigate directly to the Ensembl FTP site using the URL `https://ftp.ensembl.org`.\n  - **Goal**: Ensure we are on the correct FTP site.\n\n- **Step 2: Locate the CanFam3.1 Directory**\n  - **Action**: Navigate to the directory for the CanFam3.1 dog genome assembly.\n  - **Hint**: Use the path `/pub/release-100/fasta/canis_lupus_familiaris/dna/` to directly access the CanFam3.1 files.\n  - **Goal**: Find the specific directory containing the CanFam3.1 files.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify the Directory Content**\n  - **Action**: List the contents of the directory to confirm the presence of the required files.\n  - **Goal**: Ensure the directory contains the CanFam3.1 files.\n\n- **Step 4: Provide the Direct Link**\n  - **Action**: Copy the direct link to the CanFam3.1 files.\n  - **Goal**: Provide the verified link to the user.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Directly Access the Ensembl FTP Site**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to `https://ftp.ensembl.org`.\n\n2. **Locate the CanFam3.1 Directory**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the directory `/pub/release-100/fasta/canis_lupus_familiaris/dna/`.\n\n3. **Verify the Directory Content**\n   - **WebSurfer**: List the contents of the directory to confirm the presence of the CanFam3.1 files.\n\n4. **Provide the Direct Link**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Copy the direct link to the CanFam3.1 files and provide it to the user.\n\n### Execution\n\nPlease navigate to `https://ftp.ensembl.org` and then to the directory `/pub/release-100/fasta/canis_lupus_familiaris/dna/`. List the contents of the directory to confirm the presence of the CanFam3.1 files and provide the direct link."}
