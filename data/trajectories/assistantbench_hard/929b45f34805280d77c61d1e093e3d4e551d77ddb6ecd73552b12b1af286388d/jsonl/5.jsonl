It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the most relevant files as of May 2020.\n   - The Broad Institute has been the steward of the high-quality dog genome reference assembly, with the latest version being an improved version of the original Sanger 7x build.\n   - The genome reference assembly is available via NCBI, and NCBI provides a wide range of search functions on the assembly sequence itself via an online Blast page.\n   - The genome assembly also provides the backbone for viewing genomic data on the UCSC Genome Browser.\n   - The Broad Institute has generated RNA-Seq data from multiple tissues for the dog, which was used in the improved annotation of the dog reference.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The most recent updates to the dog genome as of May 2020.\n   - The specific files or databases where the most relevant dog genome data can be accessed as of May 2020.\n   - Authoritative sources for the dog genome data, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Ensembl, or the Broad Institute.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which specific files or datasets are considered the most relevant for the dog genome as of May 2020 based on the latest updates and research.\n   - Identifying the exact versions of the genome reference assembly, improved annotation, RNA-Seq, and variation (SNP) data sets that were most relevant in May 2020.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files as of May 2020 are likely to be part of a major release or update from a well-known genomics database, such as CanFam3.1 or a subsequent version.\n   - The NCBI's GenBank or the Ensembl database is a probable source for these files.\n   - Given the Broad Institute's role in maintaining and improving the dog genome reference, the most relevant files as of May 2020 are likely to be the CanFam3.1 reference assembly, the improved annotation data, and the RNA-Seq and SNP data sets provided by the Broad Institute.\n   - The UCSC Genome Browser is likely to host the most up-to-date and comprehensive data sets for the dog genome, including the improved annotation and RNA-Seq data.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The Broad Institute's involvement in maintaining and improving the dog genome reference suggests that their data sets are highly reliable and up-to-date.\n- The CanFam3.1 reference assembly is a widely recognized and used version of the dog genome, making it a strong candidate for the most relevant file as of May 2020.\n- The UCSC Genome Browser is known for hosting comprehensive and well-curated genomic data, making it a likely source for the most relevant files.\n- The improved annotation and RNA-Seq data sets provided by the Broad Institute are crucial for understanding the functional aspects of the dog genome, making them highly relevant for research purposes.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetition of Actions**: We repeatedly navigated to the same sections of the webpage without extracting the necessary links.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: We did not clearly identify and extract the specific links to the genome reference assembly, improved annotation, RNA-Seq, and variation (SNP) data sets.\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: We did not efficiently navigate to the sections containing the required information, leading to repeated scrolling and revisiting of the same content.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the Broad Institute Canine Genomic Resources page.\n- **Step 2**: Scroll to the section containing the genome reference assembly and extract the direct link.\n- **Step 3**: Scroll to the section containing the improved annotation and extract the direct link.\n- **Step 4**: Scroll to the section containing the RNA-Seq data and extract the direct link.\n- **Step 5**: Scroll to the section containing the variation (SNP) data and extract the direct link.\n- **Step 6**: Verify that all extracted links are correct and point to the most relevant data as of May 2020.\n- **Step 7**: Provide the final list of links.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Broad Institute Canine Genomic Resources Page**\n   - Open the URL: [Broad Institute Canine Genomic Resources](https://www.broadinstitute.org/mammals-models/broad-institute-canine-genomic-resources#Assembly)\n\n2. **Extract Genome Reference Assembly Link**\n   - Scroll to the \"Genome Assembly Data\" section.\n   - Identify and extract the link to the CanFam3.1 Reference Assembly.\n   - **Link**: [CanFam3.1 Reference Assembly - FTP](FTP link to CanFam3.1)\n\n3. **Extract Improved Annotation Link**\n   - Scroll to the \"Genome Annotation Data\" section.\n   - Identify and extract the link to the improved annotation data files.\n   - **Link**: [Improved Annotation - Data Files](Data files link for improved annotation)\n\n4. **Extract RNA-Seq Data Link**\n   - Scroll to the \"RNA-Seq Data - Broad Institute\" section.\n   - Identify and extract the link to the RNA-Seq data.\n   - **Link**: [View RNA-Seq Data](RNA-Seq data link)\n\n5. **Extract Variation (SNP) Data Link**\n   - Scroll to the \"Variation Data - Survey SNPs\" section.\n   - Identify and extract the link to the survey SNP data files.\n   - **Link**: [Survey SNPset #1 - Data Files](Data files link for survey SNPset #1)\n   - **Link**: [Survey SNPset #2 - Data Files](Data files link for survey SNPset #2)\n   - **Link**: [Illumina CanineHD Whole-Genome Genotyping Array (170K SNPs)](Illumina CanineHD data link)\n\n6. **Verify Links**\n   - Ensure that all extracted links are correct and point to the most relevant data as of May 2020.\n\n7. **Provide Final List of Links**\n   - Compile and provide the final list of links.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Scroll Efficiently**: Use the search function (Ctrl + F) on the webpage to quickly find the sections containing the required information.\n- **Extract Direct Links**: Make sure to copy the direct links to the data files rather than just the page URLs.\n- **Verify Content**: Double-check that the links lead to the specific data sets mentioned (CanFam3.1, improved annotation, RNA-Seq, and SNP data).\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. Can you please navigate to the Broad Institute Canine Genomic Resources page and start extracting the links as outlined?"}

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Let's update the fact sheet with the new information and refine our approach.\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n- The request is specifically interested in the most relevant files as of May 2020.\n- The Broad Institute has been the steward of the high-quality dog genome reference assembly, with the latest version being an improved version of the original Sanger 7x build.\n- The genome reference assembly is available via NCBI, and NCBI provides a wide range of search functions on the assembly sequence itself via an online Blast page.\n- The genome assembly also provides the backbone for viewing genomic data on the UCSC Genome Browser.\n- The Broad Institute has generated RNA-Seq data from multiple tissues for the dog, which was used in the improved annotation of the dog reference.\n- The Broad Institute Canine Genomic Resources page contains links to various data sets, including the CanFam3.1 Reference Assembly, improved annotation data, RNA-Seq data, and SNP data sets.\n- The CanFam3.1 Reference Assembly is available via an FTP link from the Broad Institute.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The most recent updates to the dog genome as of May 2020.\n- The specific files or databases where the most relevant dog genome data can be accessed as of May 2020.\n- Authoritative sources for the dog genome data, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Ensembl, or the Broad Institute.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Determining which specific files or datasets are considered the most relevant for the dog genome as of May 2020 based on the latest updates and research.\n- Identifying the exact versions of the genome reference assembly, improved annotation, RNA-Seq, and variation (SNP) data sets that were most relevant in May 2020.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Most Relevant Files**: The most relevant files as of May 2020 are likely to be part of a major release or update from a well-known genomics database, such as CanFam3.1 or a subsequent version.\n  - **Reasoning**: CanFam3.1 is a widely recognized and used version of the dog genome, and it is likely that any significant updates or improvements would be based on this version.\n- **Primary Sources**: The NCBI's GenBank or the Ensembl database is a probable source for these files.\n  - **Reasoning**: These databases are authoritative and widely used for genomic data, making them reliable sources for the most up-to-date information.\n- **Broad Institute Data**: Given the Broad Institute's role in maintaining and improving the dog genome reference, the most relevant files as of May 2020 are likely to be the CanFam3.1 reference assembly, the improved annotation data, and the RNA-Seq and SNP data sets provided by the Broad Institute.\n  - **Reasoning**: The Broad Institute is a leading institution in genomics, and their data sets are highly reliable and up-to-date.\n- **UCSC Genome Browser**: The UCSC Genome Browser is likely to host the most up-to-date and comprehensive data sets for the dog genome, including the improved annotation and RNA-Seq data.\n  - **Reasoning**: The UCSC Genome Browser is known for hosting comprehensive and well-curated genomic data, making it a valuable resource for researchers.\n- **Specific Version**: The most relevant version of the dog genome as of May 2020 is likely to be CanFam3.1, as it is the most recent and widely used reference assembly.\n  - **Reasoning**: CanFam3.1 was released in 2011 and has been the standard reference assembly for the dog genome since then, with no major updates reported after May 2020.\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Broad Institute Canine Genomic Resources Page**\n   -

The latest version is an improved version of the original Sanger 7x build, with targeted resequencing for a variety of features in the genome.\n The genome itself is available via NCBI. NCBI also provides a wide range of search functions on the assembly sequence itself via an online Blast page. The genome assembly also provides the backbone for viewing genomic data on the \nUCSC Genome Browser.\nCanFam3.1 Reference AssemblyCanFam3.1 Reference Assembly - FTPNCBI CanFam3.1 Blast UtilityCanFam2.0 (older Sanger 7x)\nGenome Annotation Data In addition to a high-quality reference, annotations are key to understanding and utilizing the dog as a model organism.
