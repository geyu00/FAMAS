{"agent": "Statistics_Expert", "content": "It seems there was an error in executing the search query due to permission issues with the Bing Search API. Since I cannot access external data directly, I will proceed with the information we already have.\n\nGiven the starting percentage of women in computer science is 37%, and the final percentage after a change of 13% is 24%, we now need to determine how many years it took for this change. \n\nFor this, we would typically need to reference historical data or reports from organizations like Girls Who Code regarding the rate of change over the years. However, since we do not have the specific rate, I'll assume a hypothetical scenario for this calculation.\n\nIf we consider a linear decrease over time, we can divide the total percentage change (13%) by a hypothetical annual decrease. Without actual data, I will need to make an assumption about the rate of decrease.\n\nFor example, if it decreased by 1% per year, it would take 13 years for the change to occur. Let me demonstrate this with Python code assuming different hypothetical rates (for example, 1% and 0.5% per year):\n\n```python\n# Assume hypothetical annual decrease rates\nannual_decrease_rates = [1, 0.5]  # percentages per year\nstarting_percentage = 37\nfinal_percentage = 24\npercentage_change = starting_percentage - final_percentage\n\nyears_taken = {rate: percentage_change / rate for rate in annual_decrease_rates}\n\n# Print the hypothetical number of years for each rate\nprint(years_taken)\n```\n\nI'll execute this code to demonstrate the hypothetical calculations."}
