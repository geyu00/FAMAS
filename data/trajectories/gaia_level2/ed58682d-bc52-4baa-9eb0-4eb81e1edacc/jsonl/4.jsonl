It was produced by \nQuincy Jones, who previously worked with Jackson on his album \nOff the Wall (1979). With the ongoing backlash against \ndisco music at the time, he moved in a new musical direction, resulting in a mix of \npop, \npost-disco, \nrock, \nfunk, \nsynth-pop, and \nR&B sounds, and darker themes; Jackson wanted to create an album where \"every song was a killer\". \nPaul McCartney appears as the first credited featured artist on a Jackson album. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at \nWestlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with a budget of $750,000. \nUpon its release, \nThriller was lauded by critics. It was Jackson's first number-one album on the US \nBillboard Top LPs & Tapes chart, where it spent a record 37 non-consecutive weeks at number one, from February 26, 1983, to April 14, 1984. Seven singles were released: \"\nThe Girl Is Mine\", \"\nBillie Jean\", \"\nBeat It\", \"\nWanna Be Startin' Somethin'\", \"\nHuman Nature\", \"\nP.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\", and \"\nThriller\". They all reached the top 10 on the US \nBillboard Hot 100 chart, setting a record for the \nmost top 10 singles from an album, with \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\" reaching number one. Following Jackson's performance of \"Billie Jean\" in the \nMotown 25 television special, where he debuted his signature \nmoonwalk dance, the album began selling one million copies per week. Sales doubled after the release of the \n\"Thriller\" music video on \nMTV in December 1983. \nBy 1984, \nThriller had sold 32 million copies worldwide, making it the \nbest-selling album of all time. It was the best-selling album of 1983 worldwide, and in 1984 became the first to become the \nbest-selling in the United States for two years. It set industry standards, with its songs, music videos, and promotional strategies influencing artists, record labels, producers, marketers and choreographers.
