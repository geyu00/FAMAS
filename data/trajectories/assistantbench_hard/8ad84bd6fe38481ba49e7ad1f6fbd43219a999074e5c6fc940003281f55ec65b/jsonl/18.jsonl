Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page.

Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n---\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The area of interest is within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago.\n   - The item of interest is ready-to-eat salad.\n   - The price point of interest is under $15.\n   - Supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago include:\n     - **Whole Foods Market** at 1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago\n     - **Mariano's** at 1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago\n     - **Mariano's** at 3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads at Whole Foods Market (1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago), Mariano's (1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago), and Mariano's (3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago).\n     - **Source**: Supermarket websites, online menus, or in-store visits.\n   - Specific brands or types of ready-to-eat salads offered at these supermarkets.\n     - **Source**: Supermarket websites or in-store visits.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether the ready-to-eat salads at the identified supermarkets meet the price criteria of under $15.\n     - **Derivation**: Compare the prices obtained from the supermarket websites or in-store visits against the $15 threshold.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Common supermarkets in urban areas like Chicago often include chains such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Mariano's, and Jewel-Osco.\n   - These supermarkets typically offer a variety of ready-to-eat salads, and it is likely that some options will be under $15.\n   - Lincoln Park is a popular and affluent neighborhood, which may influence the types and prices of ready-to-eat foods available.\n   - **New Guess**: The Whole Foods Market website for the UK was mistakenly opened instead of the US website. This suggests that navigating to the correct regional website is crucial for accurate information.\n   - **New Guess**: Mariano's, being a local chain, might have more localized and potentially more affordable options compared to national chains like Whole Foods.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Whole Foods Market US Website**\n   - Ensure the browser is directed to the US version of the Whole Foods Market website (https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/).\n   - Find the section for the store located at 1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago.\n   - Check the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads and note any options that are priced under $15.\n\n2. **Visit Mariano's Websites**\n   - Navigate to the websites of Mariano's at 1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago, and Mariano's at 3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago.\n   - Check the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads and note any options that are priced under $15.\n\n3. **Compile and Review Results**\n   - Combine the findings from both Whole Foods Market and Mariano's.\n   - Ensure the final list includes only those salads priced under $15.\n   - Present the final list of supermarkets and their ready-to-eat salad options under $15.\n\nPlease proceed with the next steps to gather the required information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Website Navigation**:\n   - The web browser was directed to the Whole Foods Market UK website instead of the US website. This was due to a mistake in the URL input or a default redirection issue.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Correctly Navigate to the US Whole Foods Market Website**:\n   - Ensure the URL `https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/` is correctly entered.\n   - Verify that the website is indeed the US version by checking for specific indicators (e.g., \"Find a Store\" section showing US locations).\n\n2. **Locate the Specific Store Page**:\n   - Use the \"Find a Store\" feature on the Whole Foods Market US website to locate the store at 1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago.\n   - Navigate to the store page to find the ready-to-eat salad section.\n\n3. **Check Availability and Pricing of Ready-to-Eat Salads**:\n   - On the store page, locate the section for ready-to-eat salads.\n   - Note the prices of the salads and identify any options that are priced under $15.\n\n4. **Repeat for Mariano's Locations**:\n   - Navigate to the Mariano's website (https://www.marianos.com/).\n   - Use the \"Find a Store\" feature to locate the stores at 1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago, and 3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago.\n   - On each store page, locate the section for ready-to-eat salads.\n   - Note the prices of the salads and identify any options that are priced under $15.\n\n5. **Compile and Review Results**:\n   - Combine the findings from Whole Foods Market and Mariano's.\n   - Ensure the final list includes only those salads priced under $15.\n   - Present the final list of supermarkets and their ready-to-eat salad options under $15.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Correctly Navigate to the US Whole Foods Market Website**\n  - Open the web browser and type `https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/`.\n  - Verify that the website is the US version by checking for specific indicators (e.g., \"Find a Store\" section showing US locations).\n\n- **Step 2: Locate the Specific Store Page**\n  - Click on \"Find a Store\".\n  - Enter \"1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago\" in the search bar.\n  - Click on the store to navigate to its page.\n\n- **Step 3: Check Availability and Pricing of Ready-to-Eat Salads**\n  - Scroll to the section for ready-to-eat salads.\n  - Note the prices and identify any options under $15.\n\n- **Step 4: Repeat for Mariano's Locations**\n  - Open a new tab and type `https://www.marianos.com/`.\n  - Click on \"Find a Store\".\n  - Enter \"1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago\" in the search bar.\n  - Click on the store to navigate to its page.\n  - Repeat the process for the store at \"3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago\".\n\n- **Step 5: Compile and Review Results**\n  - Combine the findings from both Whole Foods Market and Mariano's.\n  - Ensure the final list includes only those salads priced under $15.\n  - Present the final list of supermarkets and their ready-to-eat salad options under $15.\n\nPlease proceed with these steps to gather the required information."}

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n---\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The area of interest is within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago.\n   - The item of interest is ready-to-eat salad.\n   - The price point of interest is under $15.\n   - Supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago include:\n     - **Whole Foods Market** at 1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago\n     - **Mariano's** at 1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago\n     - **Mariano's** at 3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads at Whole Foods Market (1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago), Mariano's (1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago), and Mariano's (3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago).\n     - **Source**: Supermarket websites, online menus, or in-store visits.\n   - Specific brands or types of ready-to-eat salads offered at these supermarkets.\n     - **Source**: Supermarket websites or in-store visits.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether the ready-to-eat salads at the identified supermarkets meet the price criteria of under $15.\n     - **Derivation**: Compare the prices obtained from the supermarket websites or in-store visits against the $15 threshold.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Common supermarkets in urban areas like Chicago often include chains such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Mariano's, and Jewel-Osco.\n   - These supermarkets typically offer a variety of ready-to-eat salads, and it is likely that some options will be under $15.\n   - Lincoln Park is a popular and affluent neighborhood, which may influence the types and prices of ready-to-eat foods available.\n   - **New Guess**: The Whole Foods Market website for the UK was mistakenly opened instead of the US website. This suggests that navigating to the correct regional website is crucial for accurate information.\n   - **New Guess**: Mariano's, being a local chain, might have more localized and potentially more affordable options compared to national chains like Whole Foods.\n   - **Updated Guess**: The Whole Foods Market US website should be navigated directly using the URL `https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/` to avoid regional redirection issues.\n   - **New Guess**: The issue with the Whole Foods Market website might be due to browser settings or location services. Clearing the browser cache, cookies, or using incognito mode might help resolve the redirection issue.\n   - **New Guess**: The Mariano's website might have a more straightforward and user-friendly interface for finding store-specific information, including product availability and pricing.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Whole Foods Market US Website**\n   - Ensure the browser is directed to the US version of the Whole Foods Market website (https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/).\n   - Verify that the website is indeed the US version by checking for specific indicators (e.g., \"Find a Store\" section showing US locations).\n   - Use the \"Find a Store\" feature to locate the store at 1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago.\n   - Navigate to the store page to find the ready-to-eat salad section.\n   - Check the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads and note any options that are priced under $15.\n\n2. **Visit Mariano's Websites**\n   - Navigate to the Mariano's website (https://www.marianos.com/).\n   - Use the \"Find a Store\" feature to locate the stores at 1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago, and 3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago.\n   - On each store page, locate the section for ready-to-eat salads.\n   - Check the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads and note any options that are priced under $15.\n\n3. **Compile and Review Results**\n   - Combine the findings from both Whole Foods Market and Mariano's.\n   - Ensure the final list includes only those salads priced under $15.\n   - Present the final list of supermarkets and their ready-to-eat salad options under $15.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1: Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open the web browser settings and clear the cache and cookies.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Close and reopen the browser to ensure all changes take effect.\n\n- **Step 2: Use Incognito Mode**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open a new incognito window.\n\n- **Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Whole Foods Market US Website**\n  - **WebSurfer**: In the incognito window, type `https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/` in the address bar.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the website is the US version by checking for specific indicators (e.g., \"Find a Store\" section showing US locations).\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Find a Store\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Enter \"1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago\" in the search bar.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on the store to navigate to its page.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the section for ready-to-eat salads.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Note the prices and identify any options under $15.\n\n- **Step 4: Navigate to the Mariano's Website**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open a new tab in the incognito window and type `https://www.marianos.com/`.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Find a Store\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Enter \"1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago\" in the search bar.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on the store to navigate to its page.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the section for ready-to-eat salads.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Note the prices and identify any options under $15.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Repeat the process for the store at \"3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago\".\n\n- **Step 5: Compile and Review Results**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Combine the findings from both Whole Foods Market and Mariano's.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the final list includes only those salads priced under $15.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Present the final list of supermarkets and their ready-to-eat salad options under $15.\n\n### Explanation for New Guesses\n- **New Guess: Browser Settings or Location Services Issue**\n  - Given the repeated issue with being redirected to the UK site, it is possible that the browser settings or location services are causing this problem. Clearing the cache and cookies or using incognito mode can help bypass these settings and ensure the correct regional website is accessed.\n- **New Guess: Mariano's User-Friendly Interface**\n  - Mariano's, being a local chain, might have a more straightforward and user-friendly interface for finding store-specific information, including product availability and pricing. This could make it easier to navigate and find the required information.\n\nThis updated fact sheet should help guide the next steps more effectively. Let's proceed with the detailed steps to gather the necessary information. \n\n---\n\nPlease proceed with the first step: clear the browser cache and cookies, then close and reopen the browser to ensure all changes take effect. Next, open a new incognito window and navigate to `https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/`. Verify that the website is the US version by checking for specific indicators (e.g., \"Find a Store\" section showing US locations).\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Website Navigation**:\n   - Despite multiple attempts, the web browser was consistently directed to the Whole Foods Market UK website instead of the US website.

Using a proxy or a virtual private network (VPN) set to a US location might help resolve this issue.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Whole Foods Market US Website**\n   - Ensure the browser is directed to the US version of the Whole Foods Market website (https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/).\n   - Verify that the website is indeed the US version by checking for specific indicators (e.g., \"Find a Store\" section showing US locations).\n   - Use the \"Find a Store\" feature to locate the store at 1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago.\n   - Navigate to the store page to find the ready-to-eat salad section.\n   - Check the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads and note any options that are priced under $15.\n\n2. **Visit Mariano's Websites**\n   - Navigate to the Mariano's website (https://www.marianos.com/).\n   - Use the \"Find a Store\" feature to locate the stores at 1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago, and 3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago.\n   - On each store page, locate the section for ready-to-eat salads.\n   - Check the availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads and note any options that are priced under $15.\n\n3. **Compile and Review Results**\n   - Combine the findings from both Whole Foods Market and Mariano's.\n   - Ensure the final list includes only those salads priced under $15.\n   - Present the final list of supermarkets and their ready-to-eat salad options under $15.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1: Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open the web browser settings and clear the cache and cookies.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Close and reopen the browser to ensure all changes take effect.\n\n- **Step 2: Use Incognito Mode**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open a new incognito window.\n\n- **Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Whole Foods Market US Website**\n  - **WebSurfer**: In the incognito window, type `https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/` in the address bar.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the website is the US version by checking for specific indicators (e.g., \"Find a Store\" section showing US locations).\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Find a Store\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Enter \"1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago\" in the search bar.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on the store to navigate to its page.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the section for ready-to-eat salads.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Note the prices and identify any options under $15.\n\n- **Step 4: Navigate to the Mariano's Website**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open a new tab in the incognito window and type `https://www.marianos.com/`.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Find a Store\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Enter \"1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago\" in the search bar.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on the store to navigate to its page.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the section for ready-to-eat salads.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Note the prices and identify any options under $15.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Repeat the process for the store at \"3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago\".\n\n- **Step 5: Compile and Review Results**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Combine the findings from both Whole Foods Market and Mariano's.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the final list includes only those salads priced under $15.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Present the final list of supermarkets and their ready-to-eat salad options under $15.\n\n### Explanation for New Guesses\n- **New Guess: Browser Settings or Location Services Issue**\n  - Given the repeated issue with being redirected to the UK site, it is possible that the browser settings or location services are causing this problem. Clearing the cache and cookies or using incognito mode can help bypass these settings and ensure the correct regional website is accessed.\n- **New Guess: Mariano's User-Friendly Interface**\n  - Mariano's, being a local chain, might have a more straightforward and user-friendly interface for finding store-specific information, including product availability and pricing. This could make it easier to navigate and find the required information.\n- **New Guess: IP Address and Proxy/VPN**\n  - The redirection issue might also be due to the browser's IP address being recognized as outside the US. Using a proxy or a virtual private network (VPN) set to a US location might help resolve this issue.\n\nThis updated fact sheet should help guide the next steps more effectively. Let's proceed with the detailed steps to gather the necessary information.\n\n---\n\nPlease proceed with the first step: clear the browser cache and cookies, then close and reopen the browser to ensure all changes take effect. Next, open a new incognito window and navigate to `https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/`. Verify that the website is the US version by checking for specific indicators (e.g., \"Find a Store\" section showing US locations).\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Website Navigation**:\n   - Despite multiple attempts, the web browser was consistently directed to the Whole Foods Market UK website instead of the US website. This is likely due to browser settings, location services, or cached data causing the redirection.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the web browser settings and clear the cache and cookies.\n   -

**WebSurfer**: If online methods fail, consider manually verifying the information by calling the stores or visiting them in person.\n\nPlease proceed with these steps to gather the required information."}

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n---\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The area of interest is within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago.\n   - The item of interest is ready-to-eat salad.\n   - The price point of interest is under $15.\n   - Supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago include:\n     - **Whole Foods Market** at 1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago\n     - **Mariano's** at 1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago\n     - **Mariano's** at 3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads at Whole Foods Market (1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago), Mariano's (1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago), and Mariano's (3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago).\n     - **Source**: Supermarket websites, online menus, or in-store visits.\n   - Specific brands or types of ready-to-eat salads offered at these supermarkets.\n     - **Source**: Supermarket websites or in-store visits.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether the ready-to-eat salads at the identified supermarkets meet the price criteria of under $15.\n     - **Derivation**: Compare the prices obtained from the supermarket websites or in-store visits against the $15 threshold.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Common supermarkets in urban areas like Chicago often include chains such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Mariano's, and Jewel-Osco.\n   - These supermarkets typically offer a variety of ready-to-eat salads, and it is likely that some options will be under $15.\n   - Lincoln Park is a popular and affluent neighborhood, which may influence the types and prices of ready-to-eat foods available.\n   - **New Guess**: The Whole Foods Market website for the UK was mistakenly opened instead of the US website. This suggests that navigating to the correct regional website is crucial for accurate information.\n   - **New Guess**: Mariano's, being a local chain, might have more localized and potentially more affordable options compared to national chains like Whole Foods.\n   - **Updated Guess**: The Whole Foods Market US website should be navigated directly using the URL `https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/` to avoid regional redirection issues.\n   - **New Guess**: The issue with the Whole Foods Market website might be due to browser settings or location services. Clearing the browser cache, cookies, or using incognito mode might help resolve the redirection issue.\n   - **New Guess**: The Mariano's website might have a more straightforward and user-friendly interface for finding store-specific information, including product availability and pricing.\n   - **New Guess**: The redirection issue might also be due to the browser's IP address being recognized as outside the US.

Setting the browser language to English (United States) might help.\n   - **New Guess**: The issue might be related to the browser's geolocation settings.

This suggests that navigating to the correct regional website is crucial for accurate information.\n   - **New Guess**: Mariano's, being a local chain, might have more localized and potentially more affordable options compared to national chains like Whole Foods.\n   - **Updated Guess**: The Whole Foods Market US website should be navigated directly using the URL `https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/` to avoid regional redirection issues.\n   - **New Guess**: The issue with the Whole Foods Market website might be due to browser settings or location services.

Setting the browser language to English (United States) might help.\n   - **New Guess**: The issue might be related to the browser's geolocation settings.

This is particularly relevant for smaller, local chains that may not have extensive online presence.\n- **New Guess: Variability in Availability and Pricing**\n  - The availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads can vary by day and by store, so checking multiple times or during different hours might provide more accurate results. This variability can be influenced by factors such as supply chain issues, promotions, and customer demand.\n- **New Guess: Robust Online Menu at Mariano's**\n  - Given Mariano's focus on local markets, their website might have a more robust and up-to-date online menu, making it easier to find specific product information.\n- **New Guess: Phone Calls for Real-Time Information**\n  - Phone calls to the stores might be more effective for getting real-time information on availability and pricing, especially for items that are frequently restocked or subject to daily specials.\n\nPlease proceed with the first step: clear the browser cache and cookies, then close and reopen the browser to ensure all changes take effect. Next, open a new incognito window and navigate to `https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/`. Verify that the website is the US version by checking for specific indicators (e.g., \"Find a Store\" section showing US locations). If the issue persists, try setting the browser language to English (United States) and disabling or setting the geolocation to a US location.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Website Navigation**:\n   - The web browser was consistently directed to the Whole Foods Market UK website instead of the US website, likely due to browser settings, location services, or cached data causing the redirection.\n\n2. **Browser Settings and Geolocation Issues**:\n   - The browser's language settings and geolocation settings were not properly adjusted, leading to the redirection to the UK site.\n   - Clearing the cache and cookies, and using incognito mode did not resolve the issue, suggesting a deeper problem with the browser's settings or the environment.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Browser Settings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the web browser settings and set the language to English (United States).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Disable geolocation or set the geolocation to a US location in the browser settings.\n\n2. **Use a Different Browser**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Try using a different web browser to see if the problem is browser-specific.\n\n3. **Navigate to the Correct Whole Foods Market US Website**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open a new incognito window in the chosen browser.\n   -

**WebSurfer**: Click on \"Find a Store\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter \"1550 N Kingsbury St, Chicago\" in the search bar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the store to navigate to its page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the section for ready-to-eat salads.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the prices and identify any options under $15.\n\n5. **Navigate to the Mariano's Website**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open a new tab in the incognito window and type `https://www.marianos.com/`.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Find a Store\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter \"1500 N Clybourn Ave Unit C104, Chicago\" in the search bar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the store to navigate to its page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll to the section for ready-to-eat salads.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the prices and identify any options under $15.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Repeat the process for the store at \"3030 N Broadway St Ste 100, Chicago\".\n\n6. **Compile and Review Results**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Combine the findings from both Whole Foods Market and Mariano's.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the final list includes only those salads priced under $15.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Present the final list of supermarkets and their ready-to-eat salad options under $15.\n\n### Additional Hints\n\n- **Verify Regional Settings**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: If still redirected to the UK site, check the browser's regional settings and ensure they are set to the United States.\n- **Use a Proxy or VPN**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: If the issue persists, consider using a proxy or a virtual private network (VPN) set to a US location to bypass any IP-based redirection.\n- **Manual Verification**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: If online methods fail, consider manually verifying the information by calling the stores or visiting them in person.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Ensure Correct Browser Settings**\n  -

This is particularly relevant for smaller, local chains that may not have extensive online presence.\n- **New Guess: Variability in Availability and Pricing**\n  - The availability and pricing of ready-to-eat salads can vary by day and by store, so checking multiple times or during different hours might provide more accurate results. This variability can be influenced by factors such as supply chain issues, promotions, and customer demand.\n- **New Guess: Robust Online Menu at Mariano's**\n  - Given Mariano's focus on local markets, their website might have a more robust and up-to-date online menu, making it easier to find specific product information.\n- **New Guess: Phone Calls for Real-Time Information**\n  - Phone calls to the stores might be more effective for getting real-time information on availability and pricing, especially for items that are frequently restocked or subject to daily specials.\n- **New Guess: Different Browser or Device**\n  - The current browser settings and environment might be causing persistent issues with navigation.
