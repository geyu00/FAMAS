The specific domains within Life Sciences that I will focus on include areas such as Biology, Biochemistry, Genetics, and others, along with the Health Sciences category.\n\nLet's implement the data collection process. I'll start with writing the web scraping script in Python. \n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Set up the headers and the URL\nheaders = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}\nurl = 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/browse/journals/life-sciences'  # Example URL, please update with the accurate one\n\n# Send a request to fetch the content of the page\nresponse = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n\n# Check for a successful response\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n    \n    # Example of scraping logic (this needs to be adapted based on actual HTML structure of the page)\n    # Extract data\n    # Placeholder for scraped data, should be adjusted to reflect actual tags used on the page\n    life_science_data = []\n    health_science_data = []\n    \n    # Insert scraping logic for Life Sciences and Health Sciences here\n    # For example: \n    # for domain in soup.find_all('div', class_='domain-class'):\n    #     life_science_data.append(domain.text)\n    \n    # Here I'm assuming we have gathered the data into two separate lists\n    life_sciences = pd.Series(life_science_data)\n    health_sciences = pd.Series(health_science_data)\n\n    # Combine into a DataFrame for better handling\n    df = pd.DataFrame({\n        'Life Sciences': life_sciences,\n        'Health Sciences': health_sciences\n    })\n\n    print(df)\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to retrieve data from ScienceDirect.\")\n```\n\nI'll execute this code to collect the necessary data.
