Just give the day of the month.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The information is located in the endnote found in the second-to-last paragraph of page 11.\n   - The book has the DOI 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv.\n   - The specific information needed is the day of the month in November when a Wikipedia article was accessed.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The exact day in November when the Wikipedia article was accessed.\n   - This information can be found by accessing the book with the DOI 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv and locating the specified endnote on page 11.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - No facts need to be derived from the given information.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The day of the month is likely to be a single or double-digit number between 1 and 30, as November has 30 days. However, without looking up the specific information, it is impossible to make an accurate guess.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Book**: Use the DOI 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv to locate the book.\n- **Access the Book**: Determine if the book is available online or if a physical copy is required.\n- **Locate the Specific Page and Endnote**: Navigate to page 11 and find the second-to-last paragraph to locate the endnote.\n- **Extract the Date**: Identify the date in November when the Wikipedia article was accessed from the endnote.\n\n### Plan:\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to search for the book using the DOI 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv.\n- **Step 2**: If the book is available online, use WebSurfer to navigate to page 11 and locate the second-to-last paragraph.\n- **Step 3**: Extract the endnote and identify the date in November when the Wikipedia article was accessed.\n- **Step 4**: Provide the day of the month as the final answer."}

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The information is located in the endnote found in the second-to-last paragraph of page 11.\n   - The book has the DOI 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv.\n   - The specific information needed is the day of the month in November when a Wikipedia article was accessed.\n   - JSTOR is currently blocking access with a reCAPTCHA, making it difficult to directly access the book through their platform.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact day in November when the Wikipedia article was accessed.\n   - This information can be found by accessing the book with the DOI 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv and locating the specified endnote on page 11.\n   - Alternative sources or methods to access the book, such as Google Books, Project MUSE, or Open Access platforms.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No facts need to be derived from the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The day of the month is likely to be a single or double-digit number between 1 and 30, as November has 30 days. However, without looking up the specific information, it is impossible to make an accurate guess.\n   - The book might be available on other academic databases or repositories, such as Google Books, Project MUSE, or Open Access platforms, which could provide the necessary access to the required page and endnote.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Alternative Sources**: Given that JSTOR is blocking access, it is reasonable to assume that other academic databases or repositories might have the book available. These platforms often have similar content and can serve as viable alternatives for accessing the required information.\n- **Day of the Month**: The range of possible days (1-30) remains the same, but the need to verify this information through an accessible source is crucial.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **CAPTCHA Block**: The attempt to access the book via JSTOR was blocked by a reCAPTCHA, preventing us from directly accessing the required page and endnote.\n- **Limited Access**: The reCAPTCHA mechanism is designed to prevent automated access, which is a common issue when trying to scrape or programmatically access content from websites like JSTOR.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to search for the book on alternative academic databases or repositories.\n  - **Action**: Perform a web search on Google Books, Project MUSE, or other Open Access platforms.\n  - **Script**:\n    ```sh\n    web_search \"book with DOI 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv site:books.google.com\"\n    ```\n- **Step 2**: If the book is found on an alternative platform, navigate to page 11 and locate the second-to-last paragraph to find the endnote.\n  - **Action**: Once the book is found, open the book and navigate to page 11.\n  - **Script**:\n    ```sh\n    web_open \"URL_of_the_book_on_alternative_platform\"\n    web_scroll_to_element \"page 11\"\n    web_find_text \"second-to-last paragraph\"\n    ```\n- **Step 3**: Extract the date in November when the Wikipedia article was accessed from the endnote.\n  - **Action**: Identify the endnote and extract the specific date.\n  - **Script**:\n    ```sh\n    web_extract_text \"endnote in second-to-last paragraph\"\n    ```\n- **Step 4**: Provide the day of the month as the final answer.\n  - **Action**: Extract the day of the month from the identified date and provide it as the answer.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges:\n- **Avoid CAPTCHA**: By using alternative platforms, we avoid the reCAPTCHA block that prevented access on JSTOR.\n- **Direct Navigation**: Ensure that the web browser is directed to the specific page and paragraph to minimize the risk of missing the required information.\n- **Text Extraction**: Use precise commands to extract the text from the endnote to ensure accuracy in identifying the date.\n\n### Summary of New Plan:\n- **Search for the book on Google Books or other platforms**.\n- **Navigate to page 11 and locate the second-to-last paragraph**.\n- **Extract the endnote and identify the date**.\n- **Provide the day of the month as the final answer**."}

At the same time, the example of the \\\"\\\"costume\\\"\\\" of self-production can be used to ask about moments of cultural negotiation and change.\\r\\nNadja Neuner-Schatz, MA studied European Ethnology in Innsbruck and researches on ethnographic production/folkloristic knowledge in the modern age, phenomena of subalternisation and the Human-Animal-Studies.\\\"\",\n        \"DC.language\": \"German\",\n        \"DC.relation\": \"Bricolage monografien\",\n        \"DC.subject\": \"Volkskunde\",\n        \"DC.title\": \"Wissen Macht Tracht\",\n        \"DCTERMS.alternative\": \"im \\u00d6tztal\",\n        \"DC.type\": \"book\",\n        \"citation_keywords\": \"Volkskunde\",\n        \"citation_publication_date\": \"2018\",\n        \"citation_fulltext_world_readable\": \"\",\n        \"citation_isbn\": \"9783903122987\",\n        \"citation_title\": \"Wissen Macht Tracht : im \\u00d6tztal\",\n        \"citation_publisher\": \"innsbruck university press\",\n        \"citation_author\": \"Neuner-Schatz, Nadja\",\n        \"citation_pages\": \"228\",\n        \"citation_online_date\": \"2020-04-01T12:34:54Z\",\n        \"citation_book_type\": \"monograph\",\n        \"citation_language\": \"German\",\n        \"citation_doi\": \"10.15203/3122-98-7\",\n        \"citation_pdf_url\": \"https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/29651/1/9783903122987.pdf\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Ich danke Dir für\nDeine Geduld und dafür, dass Du zu verstehen versucht hast, warum mir diese\nDinge so wichtig waren.\n\nLieber Christoph, ohne Dich wäre ich diesen Weg niemals gegangen. Du hast\nmich  über  lange  Zeit  meines  Studiums  hinweg  begleitet,  warst  mir  Stütze  und\nAnkerpunkt. Mein Dank gilt Deiner Großherzigkeit.\n\nZu danken ist auch meinem Betreuer Prof. Dr. Timo Heimerdinger, der mich\nimmer wieder ermutigte ins Feld zu gehen, mich methodisch auszuprobieren und\nauch  ungewöhnliche  Fragestellungen  zuzulassen.  Neben  anregenden  Diskussio-\nnen im Kreis meiner Studienkolleg_innen, für die ich dankbar bin, denke ich be-\nsonders gerne an die Gespräche mit Dr. Reinhard Bodner, Dr.in Simone Egger und\nBakk. Phil. Bernadette Mayr. Diesem kollegialen Austausch habe ich so manchen\nkleinen Baustein zu dieser Arbeit zu verdanken. Meine Feldforschung begleiteten\ninsbesondere  Prof.  Dr.  Gilles  Reckinger  und  Dr.in  Diana  Reiners.  Ihnen  danke\nich für die analytischen Gespräche und supervisorischen Settings, die mich dazu\nanleiteten, Implikationen im Feld als aussagekräftige Daten wahrzunehmen. So\nkonnte mein Blick und meine Fragestellung geschärft werden.\n\nAll jenen Menschen – den vielen Gesprächspartner_innen – ohne die diese\nForschung nicht hätte durchgeführt werden können, spreche ich meinen Dank\naus. An dieser Stelle werde ich ihre Namen nicht anführen, um ihre Anonymität\nzu waren, es soll jedoch der maßgebliche Anteil, den sie an dieser Abschlussarbeit\nhaben, hervorgehoben werden.\n\nDie  historische  Distanz  erlaubte  es  mir  nach  und  in  Quellen,  Digitalisaten\nund (Online-)Archiven zu suchen, Spuren nachzugehen und andere zu verwerfen.\nAn dieser Stelle möchte ich darauf hinweisen, dass ich mich im Umgang mit den\nQuellen ihrer Historizität verpflichtet fühle, so habe ich die Schreibweise der je-\nweiligen Zitate übernommen und auf Vermerke zur jetzt gültigen Orthografie ver-\nzichtet. Auslassungen sind mit [...], Anmerkungen mit [Anm.] gekennzeichnet.\n„Tracht“ ist ein zentraler Feldbegriff, der als solcher mit „...“ gekennzeichnet ist.\n\n*  Dieser Text wurde im April 2016 als Masterarbeit an der Leopold-Franzens-Universität Innsbruck\nvorgelegt und nur im Sinne der Anonymisierung beteiligter Personen geringfügig geändert.\n\n7\n\nbricolage monografien\f\fI.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn the endnote found in the second-to-last paragraph of page 11 of the book with the doi 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv, what date in November was the Wikipedia article accessed? Just give the day of the month.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The information is located in the endnote found in the second-to-last paragraph of page 11.\n   - The book has the DOI 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv.\n   - The specific information needed is the day of the month in November when a Wikipedia article was accessed.\n   - JSTOR is currently blocking access with a reCAPTCHA, making it difficult to directly access the book through their platform.\n   - The book is titled \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\" and includes essays by Noam Chomsky and others.\n   - The book is available on OAPEN (Open Access Publishing in European Networks) and can be accessed via the PDF link: https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/29651/1/9783903122987.pdf.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact day in November when the Wikipedia article was accessed.\n   - This information can be found by navigating to page 11 of the PDF and locating the second-to-last paragraph to find the endnote.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No facts need to be derived from the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The day of the month is likely to be a single or double-digit number between 1 and 30, as November has 30 days. However, without looking up the specific information, it is impossible to make an accurate guess.\n   - The book is available on OAPEN, which is an Open Access platform, and should provide the necessary access to the required page and endnote.\n   - The PDF version of the book is likely to be the most reliable source for extracting the specific information needed, as it avoids the reCAPTCHA issue on JSTOR.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Alternative Sources**: Given that JSTOR is blocking access, it is reasonable to assume that other academic databases or repositories might have the book available. OAPEN, being an Open Access platform, is a reliable alternative.\n- **Day of the Month**: The range of possible days (1-30) remains the same, but the need to verify this information through an accessible source is crucial.\n- **PDF Accessibility**: The PDF version of the book is likely to be the most straightforward and reliable way to access the required information, as it avoids the reCAPTCHA issue and provides direct access to the text.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to page 11 of the PDF located at https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/29651/1/9783903122987.pdf.\n- **Step 2**: Locate the second-to-last paragraph and find the endnote that mentions the date in November when the Wikipedia article was accessed.\n- **Step 3**: Extract the day of the month from this date and provide it as the final answer.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges:\n- **Avoid CAPTCHA**: By using the PDF from OAPEN, we avoid the reCAPTCHA block that prevented access on JSTOR.\n- **Direct Navigation**: Ensure that the PDF viewer is directed to the specific page and paragraph to minimize the risk of missing the required information.\n- **Text Extraction**: Use precise commands to extract the text from the endnote to ensure accuracy in identifying the date.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan to find the required information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Incorrect Book**: The PDF we accessed from OAPEN was for a different book titled \"Wissen Macht Tracht\" by Nadja Neuner-Schatz, not the book with the DOI 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv.\n- **Misidentification**: The search results and metadata were not carefully verified to ensure they matched the correct book.\n- **Lack of Verification**: We did not double-check the title and contents of the PDF to confirm it was the correct book before proceeding.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Step 1**: Perform a web search for the book with the DOI 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv on OAPEN or another reliable Open Access platform.\n  - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to search for the book on OAPEN or other platforms.\n  - **Script**:\n    ```sh\n    web_search \"book with DOI 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv site:oapen.org\"\n    ```\n\n- **Step 2**: Verify the correct book is found by checking the title and author.\n  - **Action**: Ensure the search results match the expected book title and author (e.g., \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\" by Noam Chomsky).\n  - **Script**:\n    ```sh\n    web_open \"URL_of_the_correct_book_page\"\n    web_verify_title \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\"\n    web_verify_author \"Noam Chomsky\"\n    ```\n\n- **Step 3**: Download the PDF of the correct book.\n  - **Action**: Download the PDF from the verified page.\n  - **Script**:\n    ```sh\n    web_download_pdf \"URL_of_the_correct_book_pdf\"\n    ```\n\n- **Step 4**: Open the downloaded PDF and navigate to page 11.\n  - **Action**: Use FileSurfer to open the PDF and navigate to page 11.\n  - **Script**:\n    ```sh\n    file_open \"path_to_downloaded_pdf\"\n    file_navigate_to_page 11\n    ```\n\n- **Step 5**: Locate the second-to-last paragraph and find the endnote mentioning the date in November when the Wikipedia article was accessed.\n  - **Action**: Identify the second-to-last paragraph and extract the endnote.\n  - **Script**:\n    ```sh\n    file_locate_second_to_last_paragraph\n    file_extract_endnote\n    ```\n\n- **Step 6**: Extract the day of the month from the identified date and provide it as the final answer.\n  - **Action**: Extract the day of the month from the endnote and provide it.\n  - **Script**:\n    ```sh\n    file_extract_day_of_month\n    ```\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges:\n- **Verification**: Double-check the title and author of the book to ensure it is the correct one before downloading the PDF.\n- **Direct Access**: Use the PDF viewer to navigate directly to page 11 and locate the specific paragraph and endnote.\n- **Text Extraction**: Use precise commands to extract the text from the endnote to ensure accuracy in identifying the date.\n\nBy following this new plan, we can avoid the previous mistake of accessing the incorrect book and ensure we find the required information accurately."}

Privilege, he argues, brings with it the responsibility to tell the truth and expose lies, but our intellectual culture only pays lip-service to this ideal. The essay has been described as ‘the single most influential piece of anti-war literature’ of the Vietnam War period. Since then, Chomsky has continued to equip a growing international audience with the facts and arguments needed to understand – and change – our world. According to The New York Times, Chomsky ‘may be the most widely read American voice on foreign policy on the planet today’. This book revisits ‘The Responsibility of Intellectuals’ half a century on. It includes six new essays written to celebrate Chomsky’s famous intervention and explore its relevance in today’s world. Nicholas Allott, Chris Knight, Milan Rai and Neil Smith have studied and written about Chomsky’s thought for many years, while Craig Murray and Jackie Walker describe the personal price they have paid for speaking out.
