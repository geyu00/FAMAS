{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the Apple stock price.\n   - The threshold in question is $50.\n   - The stock price is not adjusted for stock splits.\n   - The source to check is Google Finance.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year when Apple's stock price first went above $50 (not adjusted for stock splits).\n   - Historical stock prices of Apple on Google Finance.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock price has undergone several splits over the years, so the historical data needs to be carefully examined without adjusting for these splits.\n   - Given that Apple's stock price has been highly volatile and has seen significant growth over the years, it is likely that the stock first went above $50 sometime in the early to mid-2000s. However, this is a guess and needs verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Use Google Finance to find the historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL).\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for the specific year when Apple's stock price first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n- **WebSurfer**: Verify the exact date or the closest date when the stock price crossed $50.\n- **Assistant**: Compile the findings and provide the final answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the Apple stock price.\n   - The threshold in question is $50.\n   - The stock price is not adjusted for stock splits.\n   - The source to check is Google Finance.\n   - We have navigated to the Apple stock page on Google Finance and set the time frame to the maximum historical data available.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year when Apple's stock price first went above $50 (not adjusted for stock splits).\n   - Historical stock prices of Apple on Google Finance, focusing on the period before and around the early to mid-2000s.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock price has undergone several splits over the years, so the historical data needs to be carefully examined without adjusting for these splits.\n   - Given that Apple's stock price has been highly volatile and has seen significant growth over the years, it is likely that the stock first went above $50 sometime in the early to mid-2000s. However, this is a guess and needs verification.\n   - Based on the historical chart and the data available, it appears that Apple's stock price started to show significant growth around the late 1990s to early 2000s, which aligns with the introduction of popular products like the iPod. This suggests that the stock might have crossed $50 around this period.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The historical chart on Google Finance shows that Apple's stock price began to rise significantly around the late 1990s and early 2000s. This period coincides with the introduction of the iPod in 2001, which was a major catalyst for Apple's growth.\n- Given the significant growth and the introduction of key products, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the stock price might have first crossed $50 around this time.\n\nNext steps:\n- Navigate to the historical data section of the Apple stock page on Google Finance and focus on the period from the late 1990s to the early 2000s to find the exact year when the stock price first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigational Confusion**: The repeated clicks on elements like \"MAX\" and \"search\" did not lead to the historical data section, which contains the detailed price history needed to answer the question.\n- **Lack of Specific Actions**: The instructions were not specific enough to guide the WebSurfer to the exact section where historical stock prices are displayed.\n- **Overlooking Key Elements**: The WebSurfer did not identify and click on the \"Historical Data\" or \"Price History\" section, which is crucial for finding the required information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Apple Stock Page on Google Finance**:\n   - Open the Apple stock page on Google Finance: `https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ`.\n\n2. **Locate the Historical Data Section**:\n   - Scroll down the page to find the \"Historical Data\" or \"Price History\" section.\n   - If the section is not immediately visible, use the search function within the page to find it.\n\n3. **Set the Time Frame to Maximum**:\n   - Click on the \"Historical Data\" or \"Price History\" section.\n   - Set the time frame to \"MAX\" to view the entire historical price data.\n\n4. **Identify the First Year Above $50**:\n   - Scroll through the historical data to find the first instance where the stock price went above $50.\n   - Note the specific year and date when this occurred.\n\n5. **Verify the Data**:\n   - Ensure that the data is not adjusted for stock splits by checking the settings or notes on the page.\n\n6. **Compile and Provide the Answer**:\n   - Summarize the findings and provide the exact year when Apple's stock price first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n### Detailed Instructions for WebSurfer\n\n- **Step 1**: Open the Apple stock page on Google Finance: `https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ`.\n- **Step 2**: Scroll down the page to find the \"Historical Data\" or \"Price History\" section.\n- **Step 3**: Click on the \"Historical Data\" or \"Price History\" section.\n- **Step 4**: Set the time frame to \"MAX\" to view the entire historical price data.\n- **Step 5**: Scroll through the historical data to find the first instance where the stock price went above $50.\n- **Step 6**: Note the specific year and date when this occurred.\n- **Step 7**: Verify that the data is not adjusted for stock splits.\n- **Step 8**: Provide the exact year when Apple's stock price first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\nPlease proceed with these steps to find the required information."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the Apple stock price.\n   - The threshold in question is $50.\n   - The stock price is not adjusted for stock splits.\n   - The source to check is Google Finance.\n   - We have navigated to the Apple stock page on Google Finance and set the time frame to the maximum historical data available.\n   - The 'Historical Data' section is located towards the bottom of the page.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year when Apple's stock price first went above $50 (not adjusted for stock splits).\n   - Historical stock prices of Apple on Google Finance, focusing on the period before and around the early to mid-2000s.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock price has undergone several splits over the years, so the historical data needs to be carefully examined without adjusting for these splits.\n   - Given that Apple's stock price has been highly volatile and has seen significant growth over the years, it is likely that the stock first went above $50 sometime in the early to mid-2000s. However, this is a guess and needs verification.\n   - Based on the historical chart and the data available, it appears that Apple's stock price started to show significant growth around the late 1990s to early 2000s, which aligns with the introduction of popular products like the iPod. This suggests that the stock might have crossed $50 around this period.\n   - The 'Historical Data' section on Google Finance provides detailed daily closing prices, which will be useful for pinpointing the exact date and year.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The historical chart on Google Finance shows that Apple's stock price began to rise significantly around the late 1990s and early 2000s. This period coincides with the introduction of the iPod in 2001, which was a major catalyst for Apple's growth.\n- Given the significant growth and the introduction of key products, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the stock price might have first crossed $50 around this time.\n- The 'Historical Data' section will provide the precise daily closing prices, allowing us to identify the exact date and year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\nNext steps:\n- Navigate to the 'Historical Data' section of the Apple stock page on Google Finance.\n- Set the time frame to 'MAX' to view the entire historical price data.\n- Scroll through the historical data to find the first instance where the stock price went above $50.\n- Note the specific year and date when this occurred.\n- Verify that the data is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n### Detailed Instructions for WebSurfer\n\n1. **Navigate to the Apple Stock Page on Google Finance**:\n   - Open the Apple stock page on Google Finance: `https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ`.\n\n2. **Locate the Historical Data Section**:\n   - Scroll down the page to find the 'Historical Data' section.

It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no,minimal-ui\",\n        \"google-site-verification\": \"sxp7zFOFUzk09RdlFhuH2SoCn5nOkXgomiLeLIQ48p0\",\n        \"mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"application-name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-title\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\": \"default\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"msapplication-tap-highlight\": \"no\",\n        \"description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_770x402.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"770\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"402\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary\",\n        \"twitter:site\": \"@google\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_496x496.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and refined educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the Apple stock price.\n   - The threshold in question is $50.\n   - The stock price is not adjusted for stock splits.\n   - The source to check is Google Finance.\n   - We have navigated to the Apple stock page on Google Finance and set the time frame to the maximum historical data available.\n   - The 'Historical Data' section is located towards the bottom of the page.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year when Apple's stock price first went above $50 (not adjusted for stock splits).\n   - Historical stock prices of Apple on Google Finance, focusing on the period before and around the early to mid-2000s.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock price has undergone several splits over the years, so the historical data needs to be carefully examined without adjusting for these splits.\n   - Given that Apple's stock price has been highly volatile and has seen significant growth over the years, it is likely that the stock first went above $50 sometime in the early to mid-2000s. However, this is a guess and needs verification.\n   - Based on the historical chart and the data available, it appears that Apple's stock price started to show significant growth around the late 1990s to early 2000s, which aligns with the introduction of popular products like the iPod. This suggests that the stock might have crossed $50 around this period.\n   - The 'Historical Data' section on Google Finance provides detailed daily closing prices, which will be useful for pinpointing the exact date and year.\n\n**New Educated Guesses:**\n   - **Stock Price Growth Timeline**: Apple's stock price has shown significant growth since the late 1990s, particularly after the introduction of the iPod in 2001. This suggests that the stock price might have first crossed $50 between 2000 and 2003.\n   - **Key Product Launches**: The introduction of the iPod in 2001 and the subsequent launch of the iPhone in 2007 were major catalysts for Apple's stock price growth. Therefore, the stock price crossing $50 is likely to be around these key product launches.\n   - **Historical Data Accuracy**: The 'Historical Data' section on Google Finance should provide accurate and detailed daily closing prices, which will help in identifying the exact date and year when the stock price first went above $50.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Product Launch Impact**: The introduction of the iPod in 2001 and the iPhone in 2007 were significant milestones that boosted Apple's stock price. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the stock price might have first crossed $50 around these periods.\n- **Historical Chart Analysis**: The historical chart on Google Finance shows a steady increase in the stock price starting from the late 1990s, with a notable surge around 2000-2003. This aligns with the introduction of the iPod and other successful products.\n- **Data Precision**: The 'Historical Data' section on Google Finance provides detailed daily closing prices, which will allow us to pinpoint the exact date and year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Apple Stock Page on Google Finance**:\n   - Open the Apple stock page on Google Finance: `https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ`.\n\n2. **Locate the Historical Data Section**:\n   - Scroll down the page to find the 'Historical Data' section. It is located towards the bottom of the page.\n\n3. **Set the Time Frame to Maximum**:\n   - Click on the 'Historical Data' section.\n   - Set the time frame to 'MAX' to view the entire historical price data.\n\n4. **Identify the First Year Above $50**:\n   - Scroll through the historical data to find the first instance where the stock price went above $50.\n   - Note the specific year and date when this occurred.\n\n5. **Verify the Data**:\n   - Ensure that the data is not adjusted for stock splits by checking the settings or notes on the page.\n\n6. **Compile and Provide the Answer**:\n   - Summarize the findings and provide the exact year when Apple's stock price first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\nPlease proceed with these steps to find the required information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigational Confusion**: The WebSurfer did not successfully locate and click on the 'Historical Data' section, which is crucial for finding the detailed price history.\n- **Lack of Specific Actions**: The instructions were not specific enough to guide the WebSurfer to the exact section where historical stock prices are displayed.\n- **Overlooking Key Elements**: The WebSurfer did not identify and click on the 'Historical Data' section, which is necessary for accessing the detailed historical price data.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Apple Stock Page on Google Finance**:\n   - Open the Apple stock page on Google Finance: `https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ`.\n\n2. **Scroll Down to Locate the Historical Data Section**:\n   - Scroll down the page to find the 'Historical Data' section.

It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no,minimal-ui\",\n        \"google-site-verification\": \"sxp7zFOFUzk09RdlFhuH2SoCn5nOkXgomiLeLIQ48p0\",\n        \"mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"application-name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-title\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\": \"default\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"msapplication-tap-highlight\": \"no\",\n        \"description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_770x402.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"770\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"402\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary\",\n        \"twitter:site\": \"@google\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_496x496.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

However, this is a guess and needs verification.\n   - Based on the historical chart and the data available, it appears that Apple's stock price started to show significant growth around the late 1990s to early 2000s, which aligns with the introduction of popular products like the iPod. This suggests that the stock might have crossed $50 around this period.\n   - The 'Historical Data' section on Google Finance provides detailed daily closing prices, which will be useful for pinpointing the exact date and year.\n\n**New Educated Guesses:**\n   - **Stock Price Growth Timeline**: Apple's stock price has shown significant growth since the late 1990s, particularly after the introduction of the iPod in 2001. This suggests that the stock price might have first crossed $50 between 2000 and 2003.\n   - **Key Product Launches**: The introduction of the iPod in 2001 and the subsequent launch of the iPhone in 2007 were major catalysts for Apple's stock price growth. Therefore, the stock price crossing $50 is likely to be around these key product launches.\n   - **Historical Data Accuracy**: The 'Historical Data' section on Google Finance should provide accurate and detailed daily closing prices, which will help in identifying the exact date and year when the stock price first went above $50.\n   - **Market Conditions**: The dot-com boom and subsequent recovery in the early 2000s could have contributed to Apple's stock price reaching $50. This period saw a resurgence in tech stocks, which might have benefited Apple.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Product Launch Impact**: The introduction of the iPod in 2001 and the iPhone in 2007 were significant milestones that boosted Apple's stock price. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the stock price might have first crossed $50 around these periods.\n- **Historical Chart Analysis**: The historical chart on Google Finance shows a steady increase in the stock price starting from the late 1990s, with a notable surge around 2000-2003. This aligns with the introduction of the iPod and other successful products.\n- **Data Precision**: The 'Historical Data' section on Google Finance provides detailed daily closing prices, which will allow us to pinpoint the exact date and year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n- **Market Conditions**: The dot-com boom and subsequent recovery in the early 2000s could have provided a favorable environment for Apple's stock to reach $50.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Apple Stock Page on Google Finance**:\n   - Open the Apple stock page on Google Finance: `https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ`.\n\n2. **Locate the Historical Data Section**:\n   - Scroll down the page to find the 'Historical Data' section.

It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no,minimal-ui\",\n        \"google-site-verification\": \"sxp7zFOFUzk09RdlFhuH2SoCn5nOkXgomiLeLIQ48p0\",\n        \"mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"application-name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-title\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\": \"default\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"msapplication-tap-highlight\": \"no\",\n        \"description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_770x402.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"770\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"402\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary\",\n        \"twitter:site\": \"@google\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_496x496.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
