{"agent": "Accessibility_Expert", "content": "To proceed with the task of identifying the closest wheelchair accessible bar to the Mummers Museum, I'll follow the manager's suggested plan step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Confirm the address of Mummers Museum\nThe exact address of the Mummers Museum is:\n- **Mummers Museum:** 1100 S 2nd Street, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the wheelchair accessibility of the listed bars\nThe bars to verify for wheelchair accessibility are:\n1. Grace and Proper\n2. 2nd Street Brew House\n3. O'Jung's Tavern Bar\n4. Garage Passyunk\n\nI'll check for their accessibility features based on common standards. \n\n### Accessibility Features to Verify\n- Entrance design: Is there a ramp?\n- Path of travel: Is the interior space easy to navigate?\n- Restroom accessibility: Are restrooms designed for wheelchair users?\n- General features: Is there adequate space for maneuvering?\n\nLet me gather data for these bars regarding their wheelchair accessibility. \n\nFor the next step, I can check the accessibility of these locations using a defined method (which typically would involve surveying or referencing accessible features on their websites). However, I would proceed to gather the necessary information systematically. \n\nPlease hold on for a moment while I gather the accessibility information for the listed bars.

{"agent": "BingAPI_Expert", "content": "To gather the accessibility information for the listed bars, I will utilize the Bing Search API to execute precise search queries that should yield relevant results regarding each bar's wheelchair accessibility. Here’s how I plan to execute this task:\n\n1. **Query the Bing Search API** for each of the listed bars and find information specifically about their wheelchair accessibility.\n2. **Extract and analyze** the response data to confirm their accessibility features.\n3. **Calculate distances** from the Mummers Museum to each of these bars to identify the closest one.\n\nI'll start with the search queries for accessibility confirmation. Here is the plan for executing those queries:\n\n### Queries to Execute\n- \"Grace and Proper wheelchair accessibility\"\n- \"2nd Street Brew House wheelchair accessibility\"\n- \"O'Jung's Tavern Bar wheelchair accessibility\"\n- \"Garage Passyunk wheelchair accessibility\"\n\nLet me execute these queries to retrieve the necessary information. I will perform these searches in a systematic manner. \n\n### Python Code to Execute\nNow I will formulate a Python script to handle this task.

{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "It appears that the searches for wheelchair accessibility information returned no results for any of the bars. This could be due to a lack of available data online regarding the accessibility features of these locations.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Since the queries didn't yield results, I will have to gather accessibility information from other reliable sources. This can include checking their official websites or reputable review platforms that mention accessibility features.\n2. While I conduct this research, I will also calculate the distances from the Mummers Museum to each of these bars using an alternative method (e.g., using a mapping service).\n\nLet me proceed by gathering accessibility information from alternate sources for each bar while calculating the distances. \n\n### Plan:\n- Manually check the following bars for wheelchair accessibility:\n   1. Grace and Proper\n   2. 2nd Street Brew House\n   3. O'Jung's Tavern Bar\n   4.
