{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the cheapest option to mail a DVD to Colombia from Hartford, Connecticut using FedEx, DHL, or USPS? (The answer should be a json object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\")\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The item to be mailed is a DVD.\n   - The destination is Colombia.\n   - The sender's location is Hartford, Connecticut.\n   - The shipping options are FedEx, DHL, and USPS.\n   - The required output format is a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\".\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for FedEx, DHL, and USPS for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping to Colombia.\n   - Weight and size requirements for DVDs for each shipping service.\n   - Any special handling or insurance costs for international shipping with each service.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping service, including base shipping rate, any additional fees, and insurance if applicable.\n   - Comparison of the total costs to determine the cheapest option.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - USPS might offer a more affordable option for lightweight items like DVDs due to their standard international mail services.\n   - FedEx and DHL might have higher base rates but could offer faster or more reliable service.\n   - Additional fees for customs or duties in Colombia might be minimal for a DVD, but it's important to verify.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Gather Shipping Rates**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform web searches to find the current shipping rates for FedEx, DHL, and USPS for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check for any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping to Colombia with each service.\n\n- **Step 2: Verify Item Specifications**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Confirm the weight and size requirements for DVDs for each shipping service to ensure the DVD fits within the standard shipping categories.\n\n- **Step 3: Calculate Total Costs**\n  - **Assistant**: Use the gathered information to calculate the total cost for each shipping service, including base shipping rate, any additional fees, and insurance if applicable.\n\n- **Step 4: Determine Cheapest Option**\n  - **Assistant**: Compare the total costs to determine the cheapest option.\n\n- **Step 5: Format and Provide Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Format the answer as a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" and provide it."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the cheapest option to mail a DVD to Colombia from Hartford, Connecticut using FedEx, DHL, or USPS? (The answer should be a json object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\")\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The item to be mailed is a DVD.\n   - The destination is Colombia.\n   - The sender's location is Hartford, Connecticut.\n   - The shipping options are FedEx, DHL, and USPS.\n   - The required output format is a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\".\n   - The USPS international shipping calculator page is currently not accessible, which may require using an alternative method to find USPS rates.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for FedEx and DHL for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping to Colombia with FedEx and DHL.\n   - Weight and size requirements for DVDs for FedEx and DHL.\n   - Any special handling or insurance costs for international shipping with FedEx and DHL.\n   - Alternative methods to find USPS shipping rates, such as contacting USPS customer support or using third-party shipping calculators.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping service, including base shipping rate, any additional fees, and insurance if applicable.\n   - Comparison of the total costs to determine the cheapest option.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **USPS might offer a more affordable option for lightweight items like DVDs due to their standard international mail services.** However, since the USPS calculator is not accessible, we need to verify this through alternative means.\n   - FedEx and DHL might have higher base rates but could offer faster or more reliable service, which might be important if time is a factor.\n   - Additional fees for customs or duties in Colombia might be minimal for a DVD, but it's important to verify. DVDs are generally not subject to high duties, but it's crucial to confirm this to avoid unexpected costs.\n   - **Given the issues with accessing the USPS calculator, we might need to rely on third-party tools or direct inquiries to USPS for accurate rates.** This could involve using services like Shippo or contacting USPS customer support directly.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **FedEx and DHL Rates:**\n   - Use the official FedEx and DHL shipping calculators to find the current shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - Check for any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping to Colombia with each service.\n\n2. **USPS Rates:**\n   - Use third-party shipping calculators like Shippo or contact USPS customer support to find the current shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - Verify any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping to Colombia with USPS.\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - Once all rates are obtained, compare the total costs to determine the cheapest option.\n   - Format the answer as a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" and provide it.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **USPS Calculator Accessibility Issue:**\n   - The USPS international shipping calculator page was not accessible, leading to an inability to gather USPS rates directly.\n   \n2. **DHL Calculator Navigation Issue:**\n   - There was an issue navigating to the DHL shipping calculator, which prevented us from obtaining DHL rates.\n\n3. **FedEx Calculator Form Filling Issue:**\n   - There was an issue with filling out the FedEx shipping calculator form, possibly due to the form not being fully loaded or the specific elements not being identified correctly.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **USPS Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use a third-party shipping calculator like Shippo to find the current USPS shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Alternatively, contact USPS customer support via phone or live chat to obtain the shipping rates and any additional fees.\n\n2. **FedEx Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the FedEx shipping calculator page and ensure the page is fully loaded.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details: Origin - Hartford, Connecticut, Destination - Colombia, Package Type - Small Box, Weight - 0.5 lbs, and any other required fields.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n3. **DHL Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the DHL shipping calculator page and ensure the page is fully loaded.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details: Origin - Hartford, Connecticut, Destination - Colombia, Package Type - Small Box, Weight - 0.5 lbs, and any other required fields.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n4. **Comparison and Final Output:**\n   - **Assistant**: Once all rates are obtained, compare the total costs to determine the cheapest option.\n   - **Assistant**: Format the answer as a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" and provide it.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **USPS Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Shippo's website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the shipping calculator to find the current USPS shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n2. **FedEx Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the FedEx shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the page is fully loaded.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination: Colombia\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and note down the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n3. **DHL Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the DHL shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the page is fully loaded.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination: Colombia\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and note down the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n4. **Comparison and Final Output:**\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the total costs from USPS, FedEx, and DHL.\n   - **Assistant**: Determine the cheapest option.\n   - **Assistant**: Format the answer as a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" and provide it.\n\n### Example JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n  \"price (usd)\": 15.00\n}\n```\n\nThis plan ensures that we address the previous issues by using alternative methods to gather USPS rates and ensuring that the forms for FedEx and DHL are filled out correctly after confirming the pages are fully loaded."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the cheapest option to mail a DVD to Colombia from Hartford, Connecticut using FedEx, DHL, or USPS? (The answer should be a json object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\")\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet, incorporating the new information and insights gained from the attempts to use the FedEx shipping calculator:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The item to be mailed is a DVD.\n   - The destination is Colombia.\n   - The sender's location is Hartford, Connecticut.\n   - The shipping options are FedEx, DHL, and USPS.\n   - The required output format is a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\".\n   - The USPS international shipping calculator page is currently not accessible, which may require using an alternative method to find USPS rates.\n   - The FedEx shipping calculator requires the destination country and a valid postal code for accurate rate calculations.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for FedEx and DHL for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping to Colombia with FedEx and DHL.\n   - Weight and size requirements for DVDs for FedEx and DHL.\n   - Any special handling or insurance costs for international shipping with FedEx and DHL.\n   - A valid postal code for Colombia to complete the FedEx shipping rate calculation.\n   - Alternative methods to find USPS shipping rates, such as contacting USPS customer support or using third-party shipping calculators.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping service, including base shipping rate, any additional fees, and insurance if applicable.\n   - Comparison of the total costs to determine the cheapest option.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **USPS might offer a more affordable option for lightweight items like DVDs due to their standard international mail services.** However, since the USPS calculator is not accessible, we need to verify this through alternative means.\n   - FedEx and DHL might have higher base rates but could offer faster or more reliable service, which might be important if time is a factor.\n   - Additional fees for customs or duties in Colombia might be minimal for a DVD, but it's important to verify. DVDs are generally not subject to high duties, but it's crucial to confirm this to avoid unexpected costs.\n   - **Given the issues with accessing the USPS calculator, we might need to rely on third-party tools or direct inquiries to USPS for accurate rates.** This could involve using services like Shippo or contacting USPS customer support directly.\n   - **A valid postal code for Colombia is needed to complete the FedEx shipping rate calculation.** We can use a common or central postal code for Bogotá, Colombia, as a representative example.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **FedEx Rates:**\n   - Obtain a valid postal code for Colombia (e.g., Bogotá, Colombia: 110211).\n   - Use the official FedEx shipping calculator to find the current shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - Check for any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping to Colombia with FedEx.\n\n2. **DHL Rates:**\n   - Use the official DHL shipping calculator to find the current shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - Check for any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping to Colombia with DHL.\n\n3. **USPS Rates:**\n   - Use third-party shipping calculators like Shippo or contact USPS customer support to find the current shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - Verify any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping to Colombia with USPS.\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - Once all rates are obtained, compare the total costs to determine the cheapest option.\n   - Format the answer as a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" and provide it.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **FedEx Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the FedEx shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination Country/Territory: Colombia\n     - Destination Postal Code: 110211 (Bogotá, Colombia)\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n2. **DHL Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the DHL shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination: Colombia\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n3. **USPS Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Shippo's website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the shipping calculator to find the current USPS shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Alternatively, contact USPS customer support via phone or live chat to obtain the shipping rates and any additional fees.\n\n4. **Comparison and Final Output:**\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the total costs from USPS, FedEx, and DHL.\n   - **Assistant**: Determine the cheapest option.\n   - **Assistant**: Format the answer as a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" and provide it.\n\n### Example JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n  \"price (usd)\": 15.00\n}\n```\n\nThis updated plan ensures that we address the previous issues by using a valid postal code for Colombia and ensuring that the forms for FedEx and DHL are filled out correctly. Additionally, we will use alternative methods to gather USPS rates.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Field Input for FedEx Calculator:**\n   - The \"Destination postal code\" field was incorrectly used to input the weight of the package, which led to the form not being completed correctly.\n   - The correct fields for package type and weight were not filled out, preventing the form from being submitted.\n\n2. **Lack of Valid Postal Code for Colombia:**\n   - A valid postal code for Colombia was not provided, which is required for the FedEx shipping calculator to provide accurate rates.\n\n3. **Repetition of Mistakes:**\n   - The same mistake of inputting the weight into the wrong field was repeated multiple times, leading to no progress in obtaining the FedEx rate.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Obtain a Valid Postal Code for Colombia:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for a valid postal code for Bogotá, Colombia, and note it down.\n\n2. **Correctly Fill Out the FedEx Shipping Calculator:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the FedEx shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination Country/Territory: Colombia\n     - Destination Postal Code: (Use the valid postal code obtained in step 1)\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n3. **Obtain DHL Shipping Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the DHL shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination: Colombia\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n4. **Obtain USPS Shipping Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Shippo's website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the shipping calculator to find the current USPS shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Alternatively, contact USPS customer support via phone or live chat to obtain the shipping rates and any additional fees.\n\n5. **Compare and Determine the Cheapest Option:**\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the total costs from USPS, FedEx, and DHL.\n   - **Assistant**: Determine the cheapest option.\n   - **Assistant**: Format the answer as a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" and provide it.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Obtain a Valid Postal Code for Colombia:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for a valid postal code for Bogotá, Colombia.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the postal code (e.g., 110211).\n\n2. **Correctly Fill Out the FedEx Shipping Calculator:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the FedEx shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination Country/Territory: Colombia\n     - Destination Postal Code: 110211\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n3. **Obtain DHL Shipping Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the DHL shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination: Colombia\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n4. **Obtain USPS Shipping Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Shippo's website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the shipping calculator to find the current USPS shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Alternatively, contact USPS customer support via phone or live chat to obtain the shipping rates and any additional fees.\n\n5. **Compare and Determine the Cheapest Option:**\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the total costs from USPS, FedEx, and DHL.\n   - **Assistant**: Determine the cheapest option.\n   - **Assistant**: Format the answer as a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" and provide it.\n\n### Example JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n  \"price (usd)\": 15.00\n}\n```"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the cheapest option to mail a DVD to Colombia from Hartford, Connecticut using FedEx, DHL, or USPS? (The answer should be a json object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\")\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The item to be mailed is a DVD.\n   - The destination is Colombia.\n   - The sender's location is Hartford, Connecticut.\n   - The shipping options are FedEx, DHL, and USPS.\n   - The required output format is a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\".\n   - The USPS international shipping calculator page is currently not accessible, which may require using an alternative method to find USPS rates.\n   - The FedEx shipping calculator requires the destination country and a valid postal code for accurate rate calculations.\n   - A valid postal code for Bogotá, Colombia is 110111.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for FedEx and DHL for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that might apply for international shipping to Colombia with FedEx and DHL.\n   - Weight and size requirements for DVDs for FedEx and DHL.\n   - Any special handling or insurance costs for international shipping with FedEx and DHL.\n   - Alternative methods to find USPS shipping rates, such as contacting USPS customer support or using third-party shipping calculators.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping service, including base shipping rate, any additional fees, and insurance if applicable.\n   - Comparison of the total costs to determine the cheapest option.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **USPS might offer a more affordable option for lightweight items like DVDs due to their standard international mail services.** However, since the USPS calculator is not accessible, we need to verify this through alternative means.\n   - FedEx and DHL might have higher base rates but could offer faster or more reliable service, which might be important if time is a factor.\n   - Additional fees for customs or duties in Colombia might be minimal for a DVD, but it's important to verify. DVDs are generally not subject to high duties, but it's crucial to confirm this to avoid unexpected costs.\n   - **Given the issues with accessing the USPS calculator, we might need to rely on third-party tools or direct inquiries to USPS for accurate rates.** This could involve using services like Shippo or contacting USPS customer support directly.\n   - **Using a valid postal code for Bogotá, Colombia (110111), should help in completing the FedEx shipping rate calculation accurately.**\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **FedEx Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the FedEx shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination Country/Territory: Colombia\n     - Destination Postal Code: 110111 (Bogotá, Colombia)\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n2. **DHL Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the DHL shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination: Colombia\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n3. **USPS Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Shippo's website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the shipping calculator to find the current USPS shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Alternatively, contact USPS customer support via phone or live chat to obtain the shipping rates and any additional fees.\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the total costs from USPS, FedEx, and DHL.\n   - **Assistant**: Determine the cheapest option.\n   - **Assistant**: Format the answer as a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" and provide it.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **FedEx Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the FedEx shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination Country/Territory: Colombia\n     - Destination Postal Code: 110111 (Bogotá, Colombia)\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n2. **DHL Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the DHL shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination: Colombia\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n3. **USPS Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Shippo's website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the shipping calculator to find the current USPS shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Alternatively, contact USPS customer support via phone or live chat to obtain the shipping rates and any additional fees.\n\n4. **Comparison and Final Output:**\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the total costs from USPS, FedEx, and DHL.\n   - **Assistant**: Determine the cheapest option.\n   - **Assistant**: Format the answer as a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" and provide it.\n\n### Example JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n  \"price (usd)\": 15.00\n}\n```\n\nThis updated plan ensures that we address the previous issues by using a valid postal code for Colombia and ensuring that the forms for FedEx and DHL are filled out correctly. Additionally, we will use alternative methods to gather USPS rates.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation and Form Filling:**\n   - The WebSurfer was repeatedly directed to the FedEx shipping calculator page but did not successfully fill out the form with the required details.\n   - The form submission process was not completed, leading to no shipping rates being obtained.\n\n2. **Lack of Clear Instructions:**\n   - The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were not detailed enough to ensure that the form was filled out correctly and submitted.\n   - There was no explicit step-by-step guidance for navigating the FedEx and DHL websites.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Obtain Valid Postal Code for Colombia:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for a valid postal code for Bogotá, Colombia.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the postal code (e.g., 110111).\n\n2. **Navigate to FedEx Shipping Calculator:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to the FedEx shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination Country/Territory: Colombia\n     - Destination Postal Code: 110111\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n3. **Navigate to DHL Shipping Calculator:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to the DHL shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination: Colombia\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n4. **Obtain USPS Shipping Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Shippo's website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the shipping calculator to find the current USPS shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Alternatively, contact USPS customer support via phone or live chat to obtain the shipping rates and any additional fees.\n\n5. **Compare and Determine the Cheapest Option:**\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the total costs from USPS, FedEx, and DHL.\n   - **Assistant**: Determine the cheapest option.\n   - **Assistant**: Format the answer as a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" and provide it.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Obtain Valid Postal Code for Colombia:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for a valid postal code for Bogotá, Colombia.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the postal code (e.g., 110111).\n\n2. **Navigate to FedEx Shipping Calculator:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to the FedEx shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination Country/Territory: Colombia\n     - Destination Postal Code: 110111\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n3. **Navigate to DHL Shipping Calculator:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Go to the DHL shipping calculator page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Origin: Hartford, Connecticut\n     - Destination: Colombia\n     - Package Type: Small Box\n     - Weight: 0.5 lbs\n   - **WebSurfer**: Submit the form and provide the resulting shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n4. **Obtain USPS Shipping Rates:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Shippo's website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the shipping calculator to find the current USPS shipping rates for sending a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Alternatively, contact USPS customer support via phone or live chat to obtain the shipping rates and any additional fees.\n\n5. **Compare and Determine the Cheapest Option:**\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the total costs from USPS, FedEx, and DHL.\n   - **Assistant**: Determine the cheapest option.\n   - **Assistant**: Format the answer as a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" and provide it.\n\n### Example JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n  \"price (usd)\": 15.00\n}\n```\n\nThis new plan provides clear, step-by-step instructions to ensure that the form is filled out correctly and submitted, avoiding the previous issues."}
