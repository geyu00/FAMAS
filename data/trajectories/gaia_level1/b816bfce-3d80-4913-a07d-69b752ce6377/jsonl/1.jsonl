{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expresses distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The name of the journal (which is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house).\n   - The specific word that was quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - The identities of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n   - The exact context in which the word was used in the article.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house (likely from Norse mythology).\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The journal is likely named after Fafnir, one of Hreidmar's sons who is known for turning into a dragon in Norse mythology.\n   - The word expressing distaste could be something like \"cliché,\" \"tired,\" or \"overdone,\" given the context of criticism towards dragon depictions.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Journal Name**: Use WebSurfer to search for information about Hreidmar's sons in Norse mythology to determine which son guarded his house and the name of the journal.\n- **Locate the Article**: Once the journal name is identified, use WebSurfer to find Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in that journal.\n- **Extract the Quoted Word**: Read the article to find the specific word quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n- **Verify the Authors**: Confirm the identities of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n- **Summarize the Findings**: Compile the information and present the word, the authors, and any relevant context."}

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children’s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children’s literature dragons.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expresses distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - The journal is named \"Fafnir\" (verified from the search results).\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The specific word that was quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - The identities of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n   - The exact context in which the word was used in the article.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house (Fafnir, as confirmed from the search results).\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The word expressing distaste could be something like \"cliché,\" \"tired,\" or \"overdone,\" given the context of criticism towards dragon depictions.\n   - The two authors quoted might be well-known scholars or critics in the field of children's literature or fantasy, as the article focuses on the uncanny nature of dragons in children's literature.\n\n### Explanation of Updates:\n- **Journal Name**: The journal name \"Fafnir\" has been verified from the search results, confirming our earlier educated guess.\n- **Identity of Hreidmar's Son**: The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house is now confirmed to be Fafnir.\n- **Word and Authors**: We still need to locate the specific word and the identities of the two authors within the article. The word is likely to be a term expressing distaste or criticism, and the authors are likely to be respected figures in the field of children's literature or fantasy.\n\nNext steps:\n- **Search the Article**: Use the search function within the article to find the specific word and the identities of the two authors quoted.\n- **Context**: Note the exact context in which the word is used to understand its significance in the article.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Search**: The previous attempts involved general browsing and scrolling through the article without using specific search terms to locate the word and the authors.\n2. **Inefficient Navigation**: The process of navigating through the article was not systematic, leading to missed information.\n3. **Overlooking Search Function**: The article's search function was not utilized, which could have quickly led to the required information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Open the Article**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to open the article \"Dragons are Tricksy\": The Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature by Emily Midkiff, published in Fafnir in June 2014.\n\n2. **Use the Search Function**:\n   - Instruct WebSurfer to use the search function within the article to look for keywords such as \"quoted,\" \"authors,\" \"distaste,\" \"dragon depictions,\" and \"cliché\" (or similar terms that express criticism).\n\n3. **Locate the Specific Word and Authors**:\n   - Identify the specific word that is quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - Note the identities of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n\n4. **Extract Context**:\n   - Extract the exact context in which the word is used to understand its significance in the article.\n\n5. **Compile and Present Findings**:\n   - Summarize the findings, including the word, the authors, and the context.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Open the Article**:\n   - WebSurfer, please open the article \"Dragons are Tricksy\": The Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature by Emily Midkiff, published in Fafnir in June 2014.\n\n2. **Use the Search Function**:\n   - WebSurfer, please use the search function within the article to look for the following keywords: \"quoted,\" \"authors,\" \"distaste,\" \"dragon depictions,\" and \"cliché.\"\n\n3. **Locate the Specific Word and Authors**:\n   - Once you find the relevant sections, identify the specific word that is quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - Note the names of the two authors.\n\n4. **Extract Context**:\n   - Provide the exact context in which the word is used.\n\n5. **Compile and Present Findings**:\n   - Summarize the findings, including the word, the authors, and the context.\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to efficiently locate the required information and avoid the previous issues."}

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children’s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children’s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.\nPublished in \nFafnirISSN\n2342-2009 (Online)\nPublisher\nFinnish Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy Research\nCountry of publisher\nFinland\nLCC subjects\nLanguage and Literature: Literature (General)\nWebsite\nhttps://journal.finfar.orgAbout the journal\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

While this type of\nfriendly dragon has become a well known resident of children’s  books, this  article argues that\nchildren’s literature dragons have been not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for\nuncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many\nmodern children’s literature dragons.\n\nFluffy Dragons\n\nIn comparison to ancient dragon lore, modern dragons for children inspire less terror and more\nlaughter, beginning most noticeably with Kenneth Grahame’s “The Reluctant Dragon” in 1898.\nRuth Stein in 1968 and Margaret Blount in 1974 both comment with distaste on the increasingly\ncuddly,   “fluffy”   nature   of   dragons   in   children’s   literature.   In   a   short   article   for  Elementary\nEducation,   Stein   expresses   hope   that   Tolkien’s   Smaug   would   improve   the   literary   dragon’s\nevolution   and  encourage   properly   scary   dragons.  While   this   has   since   proved  true   in  part,   the\nbemoaned   fluffy   dragons   remain   prevalent   alongside   Tolkien’s   menacing   breed.   Nonetheless\nBlount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they\ncould be less than terrifying and still remain “real dragons” (129). She points out several stories that\nfail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally\nbehave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in\norder to inspire conflict. Jon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a “real” dragon is and\neven praises the proliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame’s dragon, as parodies of the\noutdated cultural codes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223).\n\nHope Shastri’s 1992 dissertation on the picture book dragon gives concrete results to support\nthe observations of scholars like Stein, Blount, and Stott. Shastri performed a content analysis of\n151 picture books produced between 1950 and 1992 in order to ascertain"}

This   disconnect   with   traditional\ndragons   has   been   bemoaned   as   ruining   the   mythic   and   archetypal   power   of\ndragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than\nreadily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore:\nthe eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore,\nfrom which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary\nbeasts,   but   they   also   created   a   distinctly   unsettling   atmosphere   in   their   stories.\nModern   tamed   and   human-like   children’s   literature   dragons   borrow   certain\nuncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not\nalways   life-threatening   characters.   In   specific,   two   traits   borrowed   from   the\noriginal lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’\nintensely   possessive   gaze   and   their   clever,   manipulative   speech.

In a short article for *Elementary Education*, Stein expresses hope that Tolkien’s Smaug would improve the literary dragon’s evolution and encourage properly scary dragons. While this has since proved true in part, the bemoaned fluffy dragons remain prevalent alongside Tolkien’s menacing breed. Nonetheless, Blount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they could be less than terrifying and still remain “real dragons” (129). She points out several stories that fail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally behave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in order to inspire conflict.\n\nBy following this plan, we have efficiently located the required information and avoided the previous issues."}
