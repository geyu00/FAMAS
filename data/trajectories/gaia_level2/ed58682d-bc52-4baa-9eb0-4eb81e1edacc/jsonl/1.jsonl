It was produced by \nQuincy Jones, who previously worked with Jackson on his album \nOff the Wall (1979). With the ongoing backlash against \ndisco music at the time, he moved in a new musical direction, resulting in a mix of \npop, \npost-disco, \nrock, \nfunk, \nsynth-pop, and \nR&B sounds, and darker themes; Jackson wanted to create an album where \"every song was a killer\". \nPaul McCartney appears as the first credited featured artist on a Jackson album. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at \nWestlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with a budget of $750,000. \nUpon its release, \nThriller was lauded by critics. It was Jackson's first number-one album on the US \nBillboard Top LPs & Tapes chart, where it spent a record 37 non-consecutive weeks at number one, from February 26, 1983, to April 14, 1984. Seven singles were released: \"\nThe Girl Is Mine\", \"\nBillie Jean\", \"\nBeat It\", \"\nWanna Be Startin' Somethin'\", \"\nHuman Nature\", \"\nP.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\", and \"\nThriller\". They all reached the top 10 on the US \nBillboard Hot 100 chart, setting a record for the \nmost top 10 singles from an album, with \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\" reaching number one. Following Jackson's performance of \"Billie Jean\" in the \nMotown 25 television special, where he debuted his signature \nmoonwalk dance, the album began selling one million copies per week. Sales doubled after the release of the \n\"Thriller\" music video on \nMTV in December 1983. \nBy 1984, \nThriller had sold 32 million copies worldwide, making it the \nbest-selling album of all time. It was the best-selling album of 1983 worldwide, and in 1984 became the first to become the \nbest-selling in the United States for two years. It set industry standards, with its songs, music videos, and promotional strategies influencing artists, record labels, producers, marketers and choreographers.

It set industry standards, with its songs, music videos, and promotional strategies influencing artists, record labels, producers, marketers and choreographers. The success gave Jackson an unprecedented level of \ncultural significance for a \nblack American, breaking \nracial barriers in popular music, earning him regular airplay on MTV and leading to a meeting with US President \nRonald Reagan at the \nWhite House. \nThriller was among the first albums to use music videos as promotional tools; the videos for \"Billie Jean\", \"Beat It\" and \"Thriller\" are credited for \ntransforming music videos into a serious art form. \nThriller remains the best-selling album of all time, having sold an estimated 70 million copies worldwide. It is the best selling non-compilation album and \nsecond-best-selling album overall in the United States, and was certified \n34× platinum by the \nRecording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2021. \nThriller is frequently included in lists of the greatest albums of all time and continues to be recognized as an important event in \nAmerican culture. It won a \nrecord-breaking eight \nGrammy Awards at the \n1984 Grammy Awards, including \nAlbum of the Year and \nRecord of the Year for \"Beat It\". Jackson also won a \nrecord-breaking eight \nAmerican Music Awards at the \n1984 American Music Awards, including the \nMerit. In 2008, it was inducted into the \nGrammy Hall of Fame and the \nLibrary of Congress added it to the \nNational Recording Registry of \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant recordings\". \nBackgroundJackson's previous album \nOff the Wall (1979) received critical acclaim and was a commercial success, having sold 10 million copies at the time.\n[4][5][6] The years between \nOff the Wall and \nThriller were a transitional period for Jackson, a time of increased independence.\n[7] The period saw him become deeply unhappy; Jackson said, \"Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends ... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home.\"\n[8]When Jackson turned 21 in August 1979, he hired \nJohn Branca as his manager.\n[9] Jackson told Branca that he wanted to be the biggest and wealthiest star in showbusiness. He was upset about what he perceived as the underperformance of \nOff the Wall, feeling it had deserved the \nGrammy Award for Record of the Year.\n[10] He also felt undervalued by the music industry; in 1980, when \nRolling Stone declined to run a cover story on him, Jackson responded: \"I've been told over and over that black people on the cover of magazines doesn't sell copies ... Just wait. Some day those magazines are going to be begging me for an interview. Maybe I'll give them one, and maybe I won't.\"\n[10]\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Just wait. Some day those magazines are going to be begging me for an interview. Maybe I'll give them one, and maybe I won't.\"\n[10]For his next album, Jackson wanted to create an album where \"every song was a killer\". He was frustrated by albums that would have \"one good song, and the rest were like B-sides ... Why can't every one be like a hit song? Why can't every song be so great that people would want to buy it if you could release it as a single? ... That was my purpose for the next album.\"\n[11]Production and compositionRecordingThriller was the second Michael Jackson album produced by \nQuincy Jones.\nJackson reunited with \nOff the Wall producer \nQuincy Jones to record his sixth studio album, his second under the \nEpic label. They worked together on 30 songs, nine of which were included on the album.\n[12] \nThriller was recorded at \nWestlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with a production budget of $750,000 (US$2,443,706.9 in 2024 dollars\n[13]). The recording commenced on April 14, 1982, at noon with Jackson and \nPaul McCartney recording \"\nThe Girl Is Mine\"; it was completed on the final day of mixing, November 8, 1982.\n[14] Several members of the band \nToto were involved in the album's recording and production.\n[12] Jackson wrote four songs for the record: \"\nWanna Be Startin' Somethin'\", \"\nThe Girl Is Mine\", \"\nBeat It\" and \"\nBillie Jean\".\n[15] Unlike many artists, Jackson did not write these songs on paper. Instead, he dictated into a sound recorder; when recording he would sing from memory.\n[16][17]The relationship between Jackson and Jones became strained during the recording. Jackson spent much of his time rehearsing dance steps alone.\n[17] When the album was completed, both Jones and Jackson were unhappy with the result and remixed every song, spending a week on each.\n[17]\"Billie Jean\" was personal to Jackson, who struggled with obsessed fans. Jones wanted to shorten the long introduction, but Jackson insisted that it remain because it made him want to dance.\n[15] The ongoing backlash against \ndisco made it necessary to move in a different musical direction from the disco-heavy \nOff the Wall.\n[18] Jones and Jackson were determined to make a rock song that would appeal to all tastes and spent weeks looking for a suitable guitarist for the song \"Beat It\". Eventually, they found \nSteve Lukather of Toto to play the rhythm guitar parts and \nEddie Van Halen of the rock band \nVan Halen to play the solo.\n[15][17]When Rod Temperton wrote the song \"\nThriller\", he wanted to call it \"Starlight\" or \"Midnight Man\", but settled on \"Thriller\" because he felt the name had merchandising potential.\n[17] Wanting a notable person to recite the closing lyrics, Jones brought in actor \nVincent Price, an acquaintance of Jones' wife; Price completed his part in two takes. Temperton wrote the spoken portion in a taxi on the way to the recording studio. Jones and Temperton said that some recordings were left off the album because they did not have the \"edginess\" of other album tracks.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Temperton wrote the spoken portion in a taxi on the way to the recording studio. Jones and Temperton said that some recordings were left off the album because they did not have the \"edginess\" of other album tracks.\n[15] A cover of \"\nBehind the Mask\", originally by the Japanese band \nYellow Magic Orchestra, was omitted when the parties could not agree on royalties.\n[19]Music and lyricsThriller explores genres including \npost-disco,\n[20][21] \nfunk,\n[21][22] \npop,\n[21] \nsynth-pop,\n[23] \nR&B,\n[24] and \nrock.\n[21] According to Steve Huey of \nAllMusic, it refined the strengths of \nOff the Wall; the dance and rock tracks are more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads are softer and more \nsoulful.\n[25] The album includes the ballads \"\nHuman Nature\", \"The Girl Is Mine\" and \"\nThe Lady in My Life\", the \nfunk tracks \"Billie Jean\" and \"Wanna Be Startin' Something'\", and the \ndisco songs \"\nBaby Be Mine\" and \"\nP.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\".\n[26][22][25][27]\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" climaxes in an African-inspired chant (often misidentified as \nSwahili, but actually syllables based on \nDuala),\n[28] giving the song an international flavor.\n[29] \"The Girl Is Mine\" tells of two friends' fight over a woman, arguing over who loves her more, and concludes with a rap.\n[17][29] The album's songs have a tempo ranging from 80 beats per minute on \"The Girl is Mine\", to 138 on \"Beat It\".\n[30]Thriller foreshadows the contradictory themes of Jackson's later works.\n[31] With \nThriller, Jackson began using a motif of \nparanoia and darker themes including \nsupernatural imagery in the title track.\n[26] This is evident on the songs \"Billie Jean\", \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" and \"Thriller\".\n[22] In \"Billie Jean\", Jackson sings about an obsessive fan who alleges he fathered her child; in \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" he argues against media gossip.\n[26][25] For \"Billie Jean\", Jones had Jackson sing \noverdubs through a six-foot (180 cm) cardboard tube and brought in jazz saxophonist Tom Scott to play the \nlyricon, a wind-controlled synthesizer. Bassist Louis Johnson ran through his part on a Yamaha bass guitar. The song opens with a long bass-and-drums introduction.\n[32] \"Thriller\" includes sound effects such as creaking doors, thunder, footsteps, wind, and howling dogs.\n[17]The anti-gang-violence \"Beat It\" became an homage to \nWest Side Story and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece.\n[25][33] Jackson later said of \"Beat It\", \"the point is no one has to be the tough guy, you can walk away from a fight and still be a man. You don't have to die to prove you're a man\".\n[29] \"Human Nature\", co-written by \nSteve Porcaro of the band \nToto,\n[34] is moody and introspective, as conveyed in lyrics such as, \"Looking out, across the morning, the City's heart begins to beat, reaching out, I touch her shoulder, I'm dreaming of the street\".\n[29]By the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; AllMusic described him as a \"blindingly gifted vocalist\".\n[6]Rolling Stone critic \nStephen Holden likened his vocals to the \"breathless, dreamy stutter\" of \nStevie Wonder, and wrote that \"Jackson's feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful.

(Pretty Young Thing)\", credited to \nJames Ingram and Quincy Jones, and \"The Lady in My Life\" by Rod Temperton, gave the album a stronger \nR&B direction; the latter song was described as \"the closest Jackson has come to crooning a sexy, soulful ballad after his \nMotown years\" by \nJ. Randy Taraborrelli.\n[29] Jackson had already adopted a \"\nvocal hiccup\" (first used in 1973 on \"\nIt's Too Late to Change the Time\"\n[36]), which he continued to implement in \nThriller. The purpose of the hiccup—somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping—is to evoke emotion, be it excitement, sadness, or fear.\n[37]CoverThe cover for \nThriller features Jackson in a white suit that belonged to photographer Dick Zimmerman. The \ngatefold sleeve reveals a \ntiger cub at Jackson's leg, which, according to Zimmerman, Jackson kept away from his face, fearing he would be scratched.\n[38] Another picture from the shoot, with Jackson embracing the cub, was used for the 2001 special edition of \nThriller.\n[39]Release and commercial receptionThriller was released on November 29, 1982, through \nEpic Records[40][41][42] and internationally by \nCBS Records.\n[43][44] It reached number one on the \nBillboard Top LPs & Tapes chart on February 26, 1983.\n[45] \nThriller sold one million copies worldwide per week at its peak.\n[35] \nThriller was the \nbest-selling album in the United States in 1983 and 1984, making it the first album to be the best-selling for two years. It also spent a record 37 weeks at number one on the \nBillboard 200, from February 26, 1983, to April 14, 1984, and has remained on the chart for 626 nonconsecutive weeks (and counting).\n[46][47]Thriller was Jackson's global breakthrough, topping the charts in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Italy, \nJapan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It has gained Diamond certifications in Argentina, Canada, Denmark, France, Mexico and the UK. \nThriller sells an estimated 130,000 copies in the US per year; it reached number two in the \nUS Catalog charts in February 2003 and number 39 in the UK in March 2007.\n[48] It is the \nsixth-best-selling album in the UK.\n[49]On December 16, 2015, \nThriller became the first album to be certified 30× platinum by the \nRecording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of at least 30 million units in the US.\n[50][51] Following the inclusion of \nstreaming and tracks sales into the RIAA album awards in 2017, \nThriller was certified 33× platinum, representing 33 million album-equivalent units.\n[52] As of August 2021, the album has been certified 34× platinum in the US, denoting 34 million album-equivalent units.\n[53] By the end of 1983,\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The first, \"\nThe Girl Is Mine\", was criticized as a poor choice; critics predicted that the album would disappoint and suggested that Jackson was bowing to a white audience.\n[29] \"The Girl Is Mine\" topped the \nBillboard Hot Black Singles chart, reached number 2 on the \nBillboard Hot 100 and reached number 1 on the \nHot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.\n[67]\"\nBillie Jean\" was released on January 2, 1983.\n[68] It reached number one on the \nBillboard Hot 100 chart, where it remained for seven weeks. It also topped the \nBillboard Hot Black Singles chart within three weeks, and it remained at number 1 for nine weeks. \nBillboard ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1983.\n[69] It topped the charts in 9 countries and reached the top 10 in many others. \"Billie Jean\" was one of the best-selling singles of 1983, helping \nThriller become the \nbest-selling album of all time. It also became Jackson's best-selling solo single. \"Billie Jean\" was described as a pioneer of \"sleek, post-soul pop music\" and also the beginning of a more paranoid lyrical style for Jackson, a trademark of his later music.\n[32]The third single, \"\nBeat It\",\n[70] also reached number one on the Black Singles chart.\n[68] \nBillboard ranked it number five for 1983. \"Beat It\" reached number one in Spain and the Netherlands.\n[68] \"\nWanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" was Jackson's fourth consecutive top-ten single from \nThriller on the \nBillboard Hot 100, peaking at number 5.\n[71] \"\nHuman Nature\" reached number 7 on the \nBillboard Hot 100 and number 2 on the \nBillboard Adult Contemporary chart.\n[71] \"\nP.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\" charted at number 10 on the \nBillboard Hot 100.\n[71]\"Thriller\", the final single, was released on November 2, 1983.\n[72] It was not initially planned for release, as Epic saw it as a \nnovelty song;\n[73] according to executive \nWalter Yetnikoff, \"Who wants a single about monsters?\"\n[74] By mid-1983, when sales of \nThriller began to decline, Jackson convinced Epic to release \"Thriller\", backed by a \nnew music video.\n[74][75] It reached number four on the \nBillboard Hot 100 and number three on the \nBillboard Hot Black Singles chart.\n[71]Music videosThe \"Billie Jean\" music video debuted on March 10, 1983, on \nMTV.\n[76] It brought MTV—until then a fairly new and unknown music channel—to mainstream attention. It was one of the first videos by a black artist to be aired regularly by the channel, as the network's executives felt \nblack music was not \"\nrock\" enough.\n[77] Directed by \nSteve Barron, the video shows a photographer who follows Jackson.

It is also notable for its \"mass choreography\" of synchronized dancers, which would become the hallmark of Jackson's music videos.\n[82]The \n\"Thriller\" music video premiered on MTV on December 2, 1983.\n[83] In the video, Jackson and his girlfriend (played by \nOla Ray) are confronted by \nzombies while walking home from a movie theater; Jackson becomes a zombie and performs a dance routine with a horde of the \nundead.\n[74] It was named the greatest video of all time by MTV in 1999,\n[84] by VH1 in 2001,\n[85] and by \nTime in 2011.\n[86] In 2009, it became the first music video to be selected for the \nNational Film Registry by the \nLibrary of Congress.\n[87] The Library described it as \"the most famous music video of all time\".\n[88]Critical receptionProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource\nRating\nAllMusic[22]Blender[89]Christgau's Record GuideA\n[90]Encyclopedia of Popular Music[91]Entertainment WeeklyA\n[92]MusicHound R&B[93]Q[94]Rolling Stone[26]Thriller was widely acclaimed by critics, further strengthening Jackson's position in popular music. In a contemporaneous review for \nRolling Stone, \nChristopher Connelly called \nThriller \"a zesty LP\" with a \"harrowing, dark message\". He compared the songs on the album with the life challenges that the 24-year-old Jackson had faced since \nOff the Wall, while observing that he \"dropped the boyish falsetto\" and was facing his \"challenges head-on\" with \"a feisty determination\" and \"a full, adult voice\". Connelly emphasized Jackson's musical progression from \nOff the Wall, writing, \"Jackson's new attitude gives \nThriller a deeper, if less visceral, emotional urgency than any of his previous work, and marks another watershed in the creative development of this prodigiously talented performer.\"\n[26]John Rockwell wrote in \nThe New York Times that perhaps Jackson was a \"sometimes too practiced ... performer\", that at times Quincy Jones may \"depersonalize his individuality\" with his \"slightly anonymous production\", and that Jackson may be hiding his true emotions behind \"layers of impenetrable, gauzy veils\".\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Rockwell believed it helped breach \"the destructive barriers that spring up regularly between white and black music\", especially as \"white publications and radio stations that normally avoid \nblack music seem willing to pretend he isn't black after all\".\n[96] In \nThe Village Voice, \nRobert Christgau said \"this is virtually a hits-plus-filler job, but at such a high level it's almost classic anyway\".\n[97] He later wrote in \nChristgau's Record Guide: The '80s (1990), \"what we couldn't know is how brilliantly every hit but 'P.Y.T.' would thrive on mass exposure and public pleasure.\"\n[90]A year after the album's release, \nTime summed up the three main singles from the album, saying, \"The pulse of America and much of the rest of the world moves irregularly, beating in time to the tough strut of 'Billie Jean', the asphalt aria of 'Beat It', the supremely cool chills of 'Thriller'.\"\n[35] In 1989, \nToronto Star music critics reflected on the albums they had reviewed in the past ten years in order to create a list judging them on the basis of \"commercial impact to social import, to strictly musical merit.\" \nThriller was placed at number 1 on the list, where it was referred to as his \"master work\" and that \"commercial success has since overshadowed Jackson's artistic accomplishments on \nThriller, and that's a pity. It was a record for the times, brimming with breathless anticipation and a dread fear of the adult world, a brilliant fantasy that pumped with sexual heat, yet made room for serious reflection\".\n[98]AwardsThriller topped \nThe Village Voice's \nPazz & Jop poll of 1983.\n[99] Jackson was nominated for a record 12 \nGrammy Awards at the \n26th Grammy Awards.\n[100] The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. Jackson won seven of the Grammy Awards for the album, while the eighth Grammy Award went to \nBruce Swedien.\n[101][102][103] Richard Harrington of \nThe Washington Post described the ceremony as 'The Michael Jackson Show', writing \"it was exactly the kind of one-man show that everyone had anticipated\".\n[104] In winning the Album of the Year award, Jackson became the third-youngest to win the award after Barbra Streisand at 22 and Stevie Wonder at 23.\n[104] That same year, Jackson won eight \nAmerican Music Awards, including the \nAmerican Music Award of Merit, and three \nMTV Video Music Awards.\n[48] \nThriller was recognized as the best-selling album of all time on February 7, 1984, when it was inducted into the \nGuinness Book of World Records.\n[105]RankingsIn 1992, \nThriller was awarded the \nSpecial Billboard Award to commemorate its 10th anniversary.\n[106] In 2000, it was voted number 64 in\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
