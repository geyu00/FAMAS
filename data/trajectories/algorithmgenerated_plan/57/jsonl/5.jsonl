{"agent": "TextExtraction_Expert", "content": "It appears that the execution of the script to extract the text from the PDF file failed because it tried to import a module named 'functions', which does not exist in our environment.\n\nTo proceed, I will create a new function to extract text directly from the PDF file without relying on any external modules.

First, I need to ensure that the required library is installed, and then I'll write the extraction code.\n\nHere's the updated code for extracting text from the PDF:\n\n```python\n# filename: extract_pdf_text.py\nimport PyPDF2\n\npdf_path = '../2023/validation/Job Listing.pdf'\n\n# Function to extract text from a PDF file\ndef extract_pdf_text(pdf_path):\n    text = \"\"\n    with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as file:\n        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)\n        for page in reader.pages:\n            text += page.extract_text()\n    return text\n\nextracted_text = extract_pdf_text(pdf_path)\n\nprint(extracted_text)\n```\n\nNow, let's also ensure that `PyPDF2` is installed. I will provide the command to install it before executing the text extraction. \n\nHere's the command to install `PyPDF2` and the text extraction script:\n\n```sh\n# filename: install_and_extract_pdf.py\npip install PyPDF2\n\nimport PyPDF2\n\npdf_path = '../2023/validation/Job Listing.pdf'\n\n# Function to extract text from a PDF file\ndef extract_pdf_text(pdf_path):\n    text = \"\"\n    with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as file:\n        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)\n        for page in reader.pages:\n            text += page.extract_text()\n    return text\n\nextracted_text = extract_pdf_text(pdf_path)\n\nprint(extracted_text)\n```\n\nNow I will execute this complete code to install the library and extract the text from the PDF."}
