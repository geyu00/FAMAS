{"agent": "BiblicalScholar_Expert", "content": "To identify the first place mentioned by name in the Book of Esther (NIV), I will begin by analyzing the text. \n\nIn Esther 1:1, it states: \n\n> \"This is what happened during the time of Xerxes, the Xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush.\"\n\nThe first specific geographical location mentioned here is \"Xerxes,\" but the provinces are not specifically named. \n\nThe first city mentioned by name is actually \"Susa\" (or Shushan), which is referenced multiple times in the Book of Esther. The first occurrence is in Esther 1:2:\n\n> \"At that time King Xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of Susa.\"\n\nThus, the first place mentioned by name in the Book of Esther (NIV) is **Susa**.\n\nNow, to move forward, I need to determine who was the Prime Minister of Susa (the capital of the Persian Empire) in April 1977. Given that Susa is located in modern-day Iran, I will now look into the political situation of Iran during that time period to identify the Prime Minister. \n\nI'll start with verifying who the Prime Minister of Iran was around that date. A brief historical overview indicates that in April 1977, Iran was under the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and the Prime Minister at that time was Amir-Abbas Hoveyda. \n\nTherefore, my findings so far are:\n\n1. The first place mentioned by name in the Book of Esther (NIV) is **Susa**.\n2. The Prime Minister of Iran (where Susa is located) in April 1977 was **Amir-Abbas Hoveyda**.\n\nNow, I will verify this information to ensure its accuracy. \n\nIn summary:\n- First place: Susa\n- Prime Minister in April 1977: Amir-Abbas Hoveyda"}
