{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the worst rated series (according to Rotten Tomatoes) with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series must be rated on Rotten Tomatoes.\n   - We are looking for the worst-rated series according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of all series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Number of seasons for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Specific sources: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Amazon Prime Video (US) catalog.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Filter the list of series to include only those with more than 1 season.\n   - Identify which of these series are available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Determine the Rotten Tomatoes rating for each of these series.\n   - Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating among those that meet all criteria.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Ted Danson has starred in several series, including \"Cheers,\" \"The Good Place,\" \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" and \"Becker.\"\n   - Some of these series are likely to be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - \"Becker\" might be a candidate, as it has mixed reviews and multiple seasons.\n   - However, the actual worst-rated series will need to be confirmed through the lookup process.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify Series Starring Ted Danson**: Use WebSurfer to search for a comprehensive list of TV series starring Ted Danson.\n- **Filter Series by Season Count**: Use WebSurfer to verify which of these series have more than 1 season.\n- **Check Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**: Use WebSurfer to check if the filtered series are available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **Find Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**: Use WebSurfer to find the Rotten Tomatoes ratings for the series that meet the above criteria.\n- **Determine the Worst-Rated Series**: Compare the Rotten Tomatoes ratings to identify the series with the lowest score.\n- **Verify and Report**: Double-check the information and report the worst-rated series that meets all the criteria."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the worst rated series (according to Rotten Tomatoes) with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series must be rated on Rotten Tomatoes.\n   - We are looking for the worst-rated series according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of all series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Number of seasons for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Specific sources: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Amazon Prime Video (US) catalog.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Filter the list of series to include only those with more than 1 season.\n   - Identify which of these series are available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Determine the Rotten Tomatoes rating for each of these series.\n   - Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating among those that meet all criteria.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Ted Danson has starred in several series, including \"Cheers,\" \"The Good Place,\" \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Becker,\" \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,\" \"Damages,\" \"Bored to Death,\" \"Ink,\" \"Help Me Help You,\" and \"Gulliver's Travels.\"\n   - \"Becker\" has 9 seasons and has mixed reviews, making it a potential candidate.\n   - \"Ink\" and \"Help Me Help You\" both had short runs (one and one season, respectively), so they do not meet the criteria of having more than 1 season.\n   - \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" has many seasons and is generally well-received, so it is less likely to be the worst-rated series.\n   - \"Damages\" has 5 seasons and mixed reviews, making it another potential candidate.\n   - \"Bored to Death\" has 3 seasons and is generally well-received, so it is less likely to be the worst-rated series.\n   - \"Gulliver's Travels\" is a miniseries, so it does not meet the criteria of having more than 1 season.\n   - \"Cheers\" has 11 seasons and is highly rated, so it is unlikely to be the worst-rated series.\n   - \"The Good Place\" has 4 seasons and is highly rated, so it is unlikely to be the worst-rated series.\n   - \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" has multiple seasons and is highly rated, so it is unlikely to be the worst-rated series.\n   - Given the above, \"Becker\" and \"Damages\" are the most likely candidates for the worst-rated series with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n5. **NEXT STEPS**\n   - Verify the availability of \"Becker\" and \"Damages\" on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Check the Rotten Tomatoes ratings for \"Becker\" and \"Damages.\"\n   - Confirm the number of seasons for \"Becker\" and \"Damages\" to ensure they meet the criteria.\n   - Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating among those that meet all criteria.\n\nLet's proceed with verifying the availability and ratings of \"Becker\" and \"Damages\" on Amazon Prime Video (US) and Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incomplete Data Extraction**: The previous attempts to extract the list of TV series starring Ted Danson and their number of seasons from the Ranker page were incomplete. The page did not provide the number of seasons directly, and scrolling did not reveal the necessary information.\n2. **Lack of Verification**: We did not verify the availability of the series on Amazon Prime Video (US) or their Rotten Tomatoes ratings, which are crucial for determining the worst-rated series.\n3. **Inefficient Navigation**: Scrolling through the page manually did not yield the required information efficiently, and we did not use more targeted searches or specific queries to find the needed details.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use a More Reliable Source**:\n   - **Step**: Use IMDb to get a comprehensive list of TV series starring Ted Danson, including the number of seasons for each series.\n   - **Hint**: Search for \"Ted Danson TV series\" on IMDb and extract the relevant information.\n\n2. **Verify Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**:\n   - **Step**: For each series identified, check its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **Hint**: Use the Amazon Prime Video search function to verify if the series is available.\n\n3. **Check Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**:\n   - **Step**: For each series that meets the criteria, check its Rotten Tomatoes rating.\n   - **Hint**: Use the Rotten Tomatoes website to find the ratings.\n\n4. **Filter and Identify the Worst-Rated Series**:\n   - **Step**: Filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season and available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **Step**: Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating among the filtered list.\n\n5. **Summarize and Report**:\n   - **Step**: Summarize the findings and report the worst-rated series that meets all the criteria.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Extract List from IMDb**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Ted Danson TV series\" on IMDb.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of TV series starring Ted Danson, including the number of seasons for each series.\n\n2. **Verify Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each series, search for it on Amazon Prime Video (US) to verify availability.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note which series are available.\n\n3. **Check Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each series that is available on Amazon Prime Video (US), search for its Rotten Tomatoes rating.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the Rotten Tomatoes rating for each series.\n\n4. **Filter and Identify the Worst-Rated Series**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season and available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating.\n\n5. **Summarize and Report**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and report the worst-rated series that meets all the criteria.\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **Extract List from IMDb**:\n   - Can you search for \"Ted Danson TV series\" on IMDb and extract the list of TV series starring Ted Danson, including the number of seasons for each series?\n\n2. **Verify Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**:\n   - Once we have the list, can you check the availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US)?\n\n3. **Check Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**:\n   - For each series that is available on Amazon Prime Video (US), can you check its Rotten Tomatoes rating?\n\n4. **Filter and Identify the Worst-Rated Series**:\n   - Can you filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season and available on Amazon Prime Video (US), and identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating?\n\n5. **Summarize and Report**:\n   - Can you summarize the findings and report the worst-rated series that meets all the criteria?"}

He faces a constant barrage of life's little annoyances, which in David's sometimes well-meaning but terminally fumbling hands don't tend to stay small for very long. Episodes frequently center on his ignorance of or disregard for well-established social conventions and expectations, as well as his insistence that others adhere to rules of which only he seems to be aware. Developed from a 1999 one-hour special on HBO that was envisioned as a one-time project, the series premiered in October 2000. \nWatch on Fandango at Home\n Buy Now \nWhat to Watch\nIn Theaters\nAt Home\nTV Shows\nNew TV Tonight\n View All \nNew TV TonightIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n94%\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"TVSeries\",\n        \"actor\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Cheryl Hines\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/cheryl_hines\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/Uj9njoehluyxA1eb8hA7KJtlzNA=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/193837_v9_bb.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Jeff Garlin\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/jeff_garlin\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/ijzSmpLpPA7UoNCWJ1odJAuOM2U=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/193836_v9_bb.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Susie Essman\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/susie_essman\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/j-zHYqJtypktcurWMyf-ae7cdls=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/68734_v9_bc.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"J.B.

Reggie: Terry Farrell. John: Ted Danson. (Passage continues with 'Looking to watch Becker?')Who is Dr John Becker?\nSynopsis Dr. John Becker is easily annoyed -- by noisy neighbors, a ridiculous comment, a flickering streetlight, the antics of his misfit staff members. He's a talented and dedicated doctor and goes the extra mile for those in need, but he doesn't waste a chance to give anyone a piece of his mind.When was the first part of 'Becker vs Becker' released?\nThe first part premiered at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival on 19 February 2023. The film was released in two parts on Apple TV+ from April 7, 2023. Narrated by Gibney, the first part of the documentary details the precocious rise of Becker the tennis player from teenage Wimbledon champion to becoming world number one.What are some good TV shows to watch with John Becker?\nJohn Becker, the dedicated doctor with a heart of gold and an opinion on everything, is featured in several TV shows. In 'Take These Pills and Shove 'Em', he is irked by a diabetic patient (Peter Siragusa) who refuses to monitor his condition. In 'Sex in the Inner City', conversations and circumstances make Becker painfully aware of his lack of a sex life.
