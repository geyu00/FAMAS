Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nDetermine the first year the Apple stock went above $50 according to Google Finance, without adjusting for stock split.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Download the actual historical stock data of Apple from Google Finance.\n2. Save the downloaded data as a CSV file.\n3. Update the `csv_file_path` in the code with the correct path to the downloaded CSV file.\n4. Load the data into a pandas DataFrame.\n5. Find the first date where the closing price went above $50.\n6. Extract the year from that date.\n\n## Output format\nThe first year Apple stock went above $50.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The data should be taken from Google Finance.\n- The stock price should not be adjusted for stock split.\n\n## Results from last response\nThe task could not be completed as the file `apple_stock_data.csv` was not found in the specified directory and the correct file path was not provided.\n\n## Reason for the results\nDespite assuming the file was named `apple_stock_data.csv` and present in the current working directory, the file was not found. This caused a `FileNotFoundError` when trying to read the CSV file using pandas.\n\n## Errors or issues in the conversation\n1. The need to manually download the CSV file and provide its path was not resolved. Continuous iterations mentioning the absence of the file without action hindered progress.\n2. Lack of clear instructions or coordination on ensuring the CSV file path and name was correctly provided and confirmed before attempting to execute the Python code.\n\n### Need to double-check?\nYes\n\n## Additional information (file path, code blocks, url, etc.)\n- URL to download data manually: [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/)\n- Python code provided:\n  ```python\n  import pandas as pd\n\n  # Assuming the file 'apple_stock_data.csv' is in the current directory\n  csv_file_path = 'apple_stock_data.csv'\n\n  # Load the data into a pandas DataFrame\n  df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)\n\n  # Convert the date column to datetime\n  df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])\n\n  # Filter the rows where the closing price is greater than $50\n  df_filtered = df[df['Close'] > 50]\n\n  # Find the first date where the closing price went above $50\n  first_date_above_50 = df_filtered['Date'].min()\n\n  # Extract the year from that date\n  first_year_above_50 = first_date_above_50.year\n\n  # Output the result\n  print(f\"The first year Apple stock went above $50 was: {first_year_above_50}\")\n  ```"}
