{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time for the martial arts classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific martial arts studios or gyms within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - Class schedules for these studios or gyms to confirm if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - Authoritative sources: Google Maps for locations, studio websites or local directories for class schedules.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange to potential martial arts studios (to ensure it is within five minutes).\n   - Availability of classes during the specified time frame (7-9 pm) based on the schedules obtained.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely several fitness and martial arts studios in the Financial District area due to the high density of office buildings and professionals.\n   - Popular martial arts styles such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, and Karate might be offered in the area.\n   - Studios in the Financial District are likely to cater to working professionals, so evening classes are probably available.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify Potential Martial Arts Studios**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"martial arts studios near New York Stock Exchange.\"\n  - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to find studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n- **Step 2: Verify Class Schedules**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the websites of the identified studios to check their class schedules.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Confirm if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n\n- **Step 3: Compile and Present Information**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the list of studios, their addresses, and class schedules.\n  - **Assistant**: Provide a summary of the findings, including any relevant contact information or links to the studios' websites."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time for the martial arts classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n   - **New Fact**: Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is located at 22 New St, New York, and is open until 9 pm.\n   - **New Fact**: Systema New York City is located at South St SE, New York, and opens at 6 pm.\n   - **New Fact**: Academy of Integrated Martial Systems is located at 30 Broad St Floor 6, New York, and opens at 5 pm.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific class schedules for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, Systema New York City, and Academy of Integrated Martial Systems to confirm if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - Authoritative sources: Studio websites or local directories for class schedules.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange to Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, Systema New York City, and Academy of Integrated Martial Systems (to ensure it is within five minutes).\n   - Availability of classes during the specified time frame (7-9 pm) based on the schedules obtained.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely several fitness and martial arts studios in the Financial District area due to the high density of office buildings and professionals.\n   - Popular martial arts styles such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, and Karate might be offered in the area.\n   - Studios in the Financial District are likely to cater to working professionals, so evening classes are probably available.\n   - **New Guess**: Given that Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is open until 9 pm, it is highly likely that they offer evening classes suitable for working professionals.\n   - **New Guess**: Systema New York City opens at 6 pm, which suggests they may have classes starting around 7 pm to cater to the after-work crowd.\n   - **New Guess**: Academy of Integrated Martial Systems opens at 5 pm, indicating they might have evening classes as well, though this needs verification.\n\n**Reasoning for New Guesses**:\n- The opening and closing times of the studios provide strong indicators of their target audience. Since they are open during typical after-work hours, it is reasonable to assume they offer classes during this time.\n- The proximity of these studios to the New York Stock Exchange and the financial district suggests they cater to the professional demographic, who often look for convenient evening activities.\n\nNext steps:\n- Visit the websites of Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, Systema New York City, and Academy of Integrated Martial Systems to verify their class schedules.\n- Confirm the walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to these studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Repetition of Actions**: The WebSurfer repeatedly clicked on the same links and did not move forward to check the class schedules on the specific studio websites.\n2. **Lack of Clear Instructions**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were not specific enough to guide it through the process of visiting the studio websites and checking the class schedules.\n3. **Inefficient Use of Resources**: The team did not effectively utilize the WebSurfer to navigate and extract the necessary information from the studio websites.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Identify Specific Studios**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"martial arts studios near New York Stock Exchange\" and use Google Maps to find studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and addresses of the identified studios.\n\n2. **Visit Studio Websites**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified studio, click on the website link to open the studio's official website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the \"Classes\" or \"Schedule\" section on each website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check if the studio offers classes between 7-9 pm.\n\n3. **Compile and Present Information**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of studios, their addresses, and class schedules.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide a summary of the findings, including any relevant contact information or links to the studios' websites.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Identify Specific Studios**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"martial arts studios near New York Stock Exchange\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to find studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and addresses of the identified studios.\n\n2. **Visit Studio Websites**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the website link for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street\" (22 New St, New York).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the \"Classes\" or \"Schedule\" section on the website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check if the studio offers classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Repeat the above steps for \"Systema New York City\" (South St SE, New York) and \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\" (30 Broad St Floor 6, New York).\n\n3. **Compile and Present Information**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of studios, their addresses, and class schedules.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide a summary of the findings, including any relevant contact information or links to the studios' websites.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Specificity in Instructions**: Clearly specify the actions to be taken on each website, such as navigating to the \"Classes\" or \"Schedule\" section.\n- **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure that each step is clearly defined and that the WebSurfer does not repeat the same actions unnecessarily.\n- **Use of Summaries**: If the WebSurfer encounters a page that requires scrolling or has multiple sections, ask it to summarize the relevant information rather than just navigating through it.\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to efficiently gather the required information and avoid the previous issues."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time for the martial arts classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n   - **New Fact**: Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is located at 22 New St, New York, and is open until 9 pm.\n   - **New Fact**: Systema New York City is located at South St SE, New York, and opens at 6 pm.\n   - **New Fact**: Academy of Integrated Martial Systems is located at 30 Broad St Floor 6, New York, and opens at 5 pm.\n   - **New Fact**: Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street's contact information: Tel: (212) 217-6380.\n   - **New Fact**: Systema New York City's contact information: Tel: (212) 807-9202.\n   - **New Fact**: Academy of Integrated Martial Systems' contact information: Tel: (212) 482-1212 (based on Yelp).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific class schedules for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, Systema New York City, and Academy of Integrated Martial Systems to confirm if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - Authoritative sources: Studio websites or local directories for class schedules.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange to Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, Systema New York City, and Academy of Integrated Martial Systems (to ensure it is within five minutes).\n   - Availability of classes during the specified time frame (7-9 pm) based on the schedules obtained.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely several fitness and martial arts studios in the Financial District area due to the high density of office buildings and professionals.\n   - Popular martial arts styles such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, and Karate might be offered in the area.\n   - Studios in the Financial District are likely to cater to working professionals, so evening classes are probably available.\n   - **New Guess**: Given that Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is open until 9 pm, it is highly likely that they offer evening classes suitable for working professionals.\n   - **New Guess**: Systema New York City opens at 6 pm, which suggests they may have classes starting around 7 pm to cater to the after-work crowd.\n   - **New Guess**: Academy of Integrated Martial Systems opens at 5 pm, indicating they might have evening classes as well, though this needs verification.\n   - **Updated Guess**: Based on the contact information provided, it is likely that calling these studios will yield more accurate and up-to-date class schedules.\n\n**Reasoning for New Guesses**:\n- The opening and closing times of the studios provide strong indicators of their target audience. Since they are open during typical after-work hours, it is reasonable to assume they offer classes during this time.\n- The proximity of these studios to the New York Stock Exchange and the financial district suggests they cater to the professional demographic, who often look for convenient evening activities.\n- Contacting the studios directly is a reliable method to get the most current and accurate information about their class schedules.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Verify Class Schedules**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the 'Schedule' section of the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website (https://www.renzograciewst.com/) and extract the class times, specifically checking if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the 'Schedule' section of the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems website (https://aimsmartialarts.com/schedule) and extract the class times, specifically checking if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the 'Schedule' section of the Systema New York City website (https://www.systemanewyorkcity.com/schedule.html) and extract the class times, specifically checking if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n\n2. **Confirm Walking Distances**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to confirm the walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, Systema New York City, and Academy of Integrated Martial Systems to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\n3. **Compile and Present Information**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of studios, their addresses, class schedules, and walking distances.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide a summary of the findings, including any relevant contact information or links to the studios' websites.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to efficiently gather the required information and provide a comprehensive answer to the user's query.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues**: The WebSurfer was unable to navigate to the correct sections of the websites to find the class schedules. This could be due to the website structure or the specific instructions given.\n2. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were not detailed enough to guide it through the exact steps needed to find the class schedules.\n3. **Repetition of Actions**: The WebSurfer repeated the same actions without progressing to the next step, possibly due to a lack of clear guidance on what to do next.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Identify Specific Studios**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"martial arts studios near New York Stock Exchange\" and use Google Maps to find studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and addresses of the identified studios.\n\n2. **Visit Studio Websites**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified studio, click on the website link to open the studio's official website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the \"Classes\" or \"Schedule\" section on each website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check if the studio offers classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the class schedule is not immediately visible, use the search function on the website or look for a downloadable schedule.\n\n3. **Compile and Present Information**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of studios, their addresses, and class schedules.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide a summary of the findings, including any relevant contact information or links to the studios' websites.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Identify Specific Studios**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"martial arts studios near New York Stock Exchange\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to find studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and addresses of the identified studios.\n\n2. **Visit Studio Websites**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the website link for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street\" (22 New St, New York).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the \"Classes\" or \"Schedule\" section on the website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check if the studio offers classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the class schedule is not immediately visible, use the search function on the website or look for a downloadable schedule.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Repeat the above steps for \"Systema New York City\" (South St SE, New York) and \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\" (30 Broad St Floor 6, New York).\n\n3. **Compile and Present Information**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of studios, their addresses, and class schedules.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide a summary of the findings, including any relevant contact information or links to the studios' websites.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Specificity in Instructions**: Clearly specify the actions to be taken on each website, such as navigating to the \"Classes\" or \"Schedule\" section.\n- **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure that each step is clearly defined and that the WebSurfer does not repeat the same actions unnecessarily.\n- **Use of Summaries**: If the WebSurfer encounters a page that requires scrolling or has multiple sections, ask it to summarize the relevant information rather than just navigating through it.\n- **Fallback to Contact Information**: If the class schedules are not easily found on the website, note the contact information (phone number, email) to suggest reaching out directly for more details."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time for the martial arts classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n   - **Verified Fact**: Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is located at 22 New St, New York, and is open until 9 pm.\n   - **Verified Fact**: Systema New York City is located at South St SE, New York, and opens at 6 pm.\n   - **Verified Fact**: Academy of Integrated Martial Systems is located at 30 Broad St Floor 6, New York, and opens at 5 pm.\n   - **Verified Fact**: Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street's contact information: Tel: (212) 217-6380.\n   - **Verified Fact**: Systema New York City's contact information: Tel: (212) 807-9202.\n   - **Verified Fact**: Academy of Integrated Martial Systems' contact information: Tel: (212) 482-1212 (based on Yelp).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific class schedules for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, Systema New York City, and Academy of Integrated Martial Systems to confirm if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - Authoritative sources: Studio websites or local directories for class schedules.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange to Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, Systema New York City, and Academy of Integrated Martial Systems (to ensure it is within five minutes).\n   - Availability of classes during the specified time frame (7-9 pm) based on the schedules obtained.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely several fitness and martial arts studios in the Financial District area due to the high density of office buildings and professionals.\n   - Popular martial arts styles such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, and Karate might be offered in the area.\n   - Studios in the Financial District are likely to cater to working professionals, so evening classes are probably available.\n   - **Updated Guess**: Given that Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is open until 9 pm, it is highly likely that they offer evening classes suitable for working professionals.\n   - **Updated Guess**: Systema New York City opens at 6 pm, which suggests they may have classes starting around 7 pm to cater to the after-work crowd.\n   - **Updated Guess**: Academy of Integrated Martial Systems opens at 5 pm, indicating they might have evening classes as well, though this needs verification.\n   - **New Guess**: The 'DOWNLOAD FULL SCHEDULE' link on the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website may lead to a downloadable PDF or a more detailed online schedule that includes evening classes. This should be checked to confirm class times.\n\n**Reasoning for New Guesses**:\n- The opening and closing times of the studios provide strong indicators of their target audience. Since they are open during typical after-work hours, it is reasonable to assume they offer classes during this time.\n- The proximity of these studios to the New York Stock Exchange and the financial district suggests they cater to the professional demographic, who often look for convenient evening activities.\n- Contacting the studios directly is a reliable method to get the most current and accurate information about their class schedules.\n- The 'DOWNLOAD FULL SCHEDULE' link is a common feature on many studio websites and often provides a more detailed and comprehensive view of class times, which may include the desired evening classes.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Verify Class Schedules**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the 'Schedule' section of the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website (https://www.renzograciewst.com/) and extract the class times, specifically checking if they offer classes between 7-9 pm. If the schedule is not immediately visible, click on the 'DOWNLOAD FULL SCHEDULE' link.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the 'Schedule' section of the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems website (https://aimsmartialarts.com/schedule) and extract the class times, specifically checking if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the 'Schedule' section of the Systema New York City website (https://www.systemanewyorkcity.com/schedule.html) and extract the class times, specifically checking if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n\n2. **Confirm Walking Distances**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to confirm the walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, Systema New York City, and Academy of Integrated Martial Systems to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\n3. **Compile and Present Information**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of studios, their addresses, class schedules, and walking distances.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide a summary of the findings, including any relevant contact information or links to the studios' websites.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to efficiently gather the required information and provide a comprehensive answer to the user's query.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues**: The WebSurfer was unable to navigate to the correct sections of the websites to find the class schedules. This could be due to the website structure or the specific instructions given.\n2. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were not detailed enough to guide it through the exact steps needed to find the class schedules.\n3. **Repetition of Actions**: The WebSurfer repeated the same actions without progressing to the next step, possibly due to a lack of clear guidance on what to do next.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Identify Specific Studios**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"martial arts studios near New York Stock Exchange\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to find studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and addresses of the identified studios.\n\n2. **Visit Studio Websites**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the website link for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street\" (22 New St, New York).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the \"Classes\" or \"Schedule\" section on the website.\n     - **Hint**: If the schedule is not immediately visible, click on the 'DOWNLOAD FULL SCHEDULE' link.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check if the studio offers classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Repeat the above steps for \"Systema New York City\" (South St SE, New York) and \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\" (30 Broad St Floor 6, New York).\n\n3. **Confirm Walking Distances**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to confirm the walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to each identified studio to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\n4. **Compile and Present Information**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of studios, their addresses, and class schedules.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide a summary of the findings, including any relevant contact information or links to the studios' websites.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Identify Specific Studios**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"martial arts studios near New York Stock Exchange\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to find studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and addresses of the identified studios.\n\n2. **Visit Studio Websites**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the website link for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street\" (22 New St, New York).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the 'Schedule' section or click on the 'Schedule' link in the navigation menu.\n     - **Hint**: If the schedule is not immediately visible, click on the 'DOWNLOAD FULL SCHEDULE' link and extract the class times.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check if the studio offers classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Repeat the above steps for \"Systema New York City\" (South St SE, New York) and \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\" (30 Broad St Floor 6, New York).\n\n3. **Confirm Walking Distances**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to confirm the walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to each identified studio to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\n4. **Compile and Present Information**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the list of studios, their addresses, class schedules, and walking distances.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide a summary of the findings, including any relevant contact information or links to the studios' websites."}
