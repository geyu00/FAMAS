Verify if they have classes scheduled between 7-9 pm.\n\nLet's execute this search now. \n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Define the location of the NYSE\nlocation = \"11 Wall Street, New York, NY 10005\"\nradius = 0.25  # in miles\n\n# Function to search for martial arts schools using Google Places API\ndef find_martial_arts_schools(location, radius):\n    # Replace with your actual Google API key\n    api_key = \"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\"\n    url = f\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?location={location}&radius={radius * 1609.34}&type=martial_art&key={api_key}\"\n    \n    response = requests.get(url)\n    return response.json()\n\n# Execute the function to find martial arts schools\nmartial_arts_schools = find_martial_arts_schools(location, radius)\nmartial_arts_schools\n```\n\n**Note:** You will need to replace \"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\" with an actual Google Places API key to retrieve this information.
