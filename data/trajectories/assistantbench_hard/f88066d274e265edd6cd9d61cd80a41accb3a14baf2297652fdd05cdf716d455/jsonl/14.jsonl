It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park.\n   - Trails must have more than 1,000 reviews on TripAdvisor.\n   - Trails must be recommended as fully accessible to wheelchairs by at least three different people.\n   - Trails must have an average rating of 4.5/5 or higher on TripAdvisor.\n   - Some popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park include Yosemite Falls Trail, Mist Trail, Bridalveil Fall Trail, and Wawona Point Trail.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Number of reviews for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n   - Average ratings for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n   - Recommendations regarding wheelchair accessibility for each trail, specifically from at least three different sources.\n   - Additional popular trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park that might meet the criteria.\n   - These details can be found on TripAdvisor, the official Yosemite National Park website, and possibly other travel and accessibility guides.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which trails meet all the criteria (more than 1,000 reviews, 4.5/5 or higher rating, and at least three recommendations for wheelchair accessibility).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Lower Yosemite Fall Trail is likely to meet the criteria due to its popularity and known accessibility features. It is often mentioned as being accessible to wheelchairs, particularly the lower portion.\n   - The Bridalveil Fall Trail is another strong candidate due to its short and easy nature, which makes it more likely to be accessible to wheelchairs.\n   - The Mist Trail, despite its popularity, is unlikely to meet the wheelchair accessibility criteria due to its steep and rocky terrain.\n   - The Wawona Point Trail, while less crowded, might not have enough reviews or accessibility recommendations to meet the criteria.\n   - Other trails, such as the Valley Loop Trail, might also be worth investigating for their accessibility and popularity.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: This trail is well-known for its accessibility, particularly the lower section, which is paved and flat. It is often recommended for families and individuals with mobility challenges.\n- **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: This trail is short and relatively flat, making it a good candidate for wheelchair accessibility. It is also very popular, likely to have a high number of reviews and positive ratings.\n- **Mist Trail**: While a famous and scenic trail, it is known for its steep and uneven terrain, which makes it less likely to be recommended for wheelchair users.\n- **Wawona Point Trail**: Although it offers unique views, it is less frequented and might not have the necessary reviews or accessibility recommendations.\n- **Valley Loop Trail**: This trail is part of the Yosemite Valley and is known for its accessibility, making it a potential candidate that should be investigated further.\n\nLet's proceed by focusing on the Lower Yosemite Fall Trail and the Bridalveil Fall Trail first, as they seem the most promising based on our current knowledge. We will verify the number of reviews, average ratings, and wheelchair accessibility recommendations for these trails.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\nThe primary issue encountered was that the WebSurfer was unable to locate the search input field on the TripAdvisor homepage, leading to repeated errors. This could be due to several reasons:\n- The search input field ID or class name might have changed.\n- The page might not have fully loaded before the WebSurfer attempted to interact with it.\n- There might be dynamic content or JavaScript that needs to be executed before the search input field becomes available.\n\n### New Plan\n\nTo avoid repeating the same mistakes and ensure we successfully gather the required information, here is a revised plan:\n\n1. **Verify Page Load and Element Availability**\n   - **Step 1**: Navigate to the TripAdvisor homepage.\n   - **Step 2**: Wait for the page to fully load before attempting to interact with it.\n   - **Step 3**: Inspect the page to identify the correct ID or class name of the search input field.\n\n2. **Search for Trails**\n   - **Step 4**: Enter the search terms for each trail (Yosemite Falls Trail, Mist Trail, Bridalveil Fall Trail, and Wawona Point Trail) one by one.\n   - **Step 5**: Click the search button or press Enter to initiate the search.\n\n3. **Collect Information**\n   - **Step 6**: For each trail, collect the number of reviews, average rating, and any mentions of wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **Step 7**: Look for at least three different recommendations or reviews that mention full wheelchair accessibility.\n\n4. **Summarize and Compile Results**\n   - **Step 8**: Compile a list of trails that meet all the criteria (more than 1,000 reviews, 4.5/5 or higher rating, and at least three recommendations for wheelchair accessibility).\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to TripAdvisor Homepage**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the TripAdvisor homepage (`https://www.tripadvisor.com`).\n\n2. **Wait for Page to Fully Load**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Sleep for 5 seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded.\n     ```sh\n     sleep 5\n     ```\n\n3. **Inspect and Identify Search Input Field**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Inspect the page to find the correct ID or class name of the search input field.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Report the ID or class name of the search input field.\n\n4. **Enter Search Terms and Initiate Search**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill the search input field with the trail name (e.g., \"Yosemite Falls Trail\").\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click the search button or press Enter to initiate the search.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Sleep for 5 seconds to ensure the search results page is fully loaded.\n     ```sh\n     sleep 5\n     ```\n\n5. **Collect Information for Each Trail**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the number of reviews, average rating, and any mentions of wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for at least three different recommendations or reviews that mention full wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Report the collected information for each trail.\n\n6. **Compile and Present Final List**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compile a list of trails that meet all the criteria.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Provide the names of the trails, their average ratings, number of reviews, and any relevant comments or links to the recommendations for wheelchair accessibility.\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to successfully gather the required information and avoid the previous issues."}

Here is the updated fact sheet, incorporating the new insights and refining our approach:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park.\n   - Trails must have more than 1,000 reviews on TripAdvisor.\n   - Trails must be recommended as fully accessible to wheelchairs by at least three different people.\n   - Trails must have an average rating of 4.5/5 or higher on TripAdvisor.\n   - Some popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park include Yosemite Falls Trail, Mist Trail, Bridalveil Fall Trail, and Wawona Point Trail.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Number of reviews for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n   - Average ratings for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n   - Recommendations regarding wheelchair accessibility for each trail, specifically from at least three different sources.\n   - Additional popular trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park that might meet the criteria.\n   - These details can be found on TripAdvisor, the official Yosemite National Park website, and possibly other travel and accessibility guides.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which trails meet all the criteria (more than 1,000 reviews, 4.5/5 or higher rating, and at least three recommendations for wheelchair accessibility).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: This trail is likely to meet the criteria due to its popularity and known accessibility features. It is often mentioned as being accessible to wheelchairs, particularly the lower portion.\n   - **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: This trail is another strong candidate due to its short and easy nature, which makes it more likely to be accessible to wheelchairs. It is also very popular, likely to have a high number of reviews and positive ratings.\n   - **Mist Trail**: Despite its popularity, it is unlikely to meet the wheelchair accessibility criteria due to its steep and rocky terrain.\n   - **Wawona Point Trail**: While it offers unique views, it is less frequented and might not have enough reviews or accessibility recommendations to meet the criteria.\n   - **Valley Loop Trail**: This trail is part of the Yosemite Valley and is known for its accessibility, making it a potential candidate that should be investigated further.\n   - **Other Trails**: Trails such as the Vernal Fall Footbridge and the Nevada Fall Trail might also be worth investigating for their accessibility and popularity.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: This trail is well-known for its accessibility, particularly the lower section, which is paved and flat. It is often recommended for families and individuals with mobility challenges.\n- **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: This trail is short and relatively flat, making it a good candidate for wheelchair accessibility. It is also very popular, likely to have a high number of reviews and positive ratings.\n- **Mist Trail**: While a famous and scenic trail, it is known for its steep and uneven terrain, which makes it less likely to be recommended for wheelchair users.\n- **Wawona Point Trail**: Although it offers unique views, it is less frequented and might not have the necessary reviews or accessibility recommendations.\n- **Valley Loop Trail**: This trail is part of the Yosemite Valley and is known for its accessibility, making it a potential candidate that should be investigated further.\n- **Vernal Fall Footbridge and Nevada Fall Trail**: These trails are shorter and less strenuous compared to the Mist Trail, and might have better accessibility features. They are also popular and could have the necessary reviews and ratings.\n\n### New Plan\n\nTo avoid the previous issues and ensure we successfully gather the required information, here is a revised plan:\n\n1. **Navigate to TripAdvisor Homepage**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the TripAdvisor homepage (`https://www.tripadvisor.com`).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Sleep for 5 seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded.\n     ```sh\n     sleep 5\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify Search Input Field**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Inspect the page to find the correct ID or class name of the search input field.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Report the ID or class name of the search input field.\n\n3. **Search for Trails**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter the search terms for each trail (Yosemite Falls Trail, Mist Trail, Bridalveil Fall Trail, Wawona Point Trail, Valley Loop Trail, Vernal Fall Footbridge, and Nevada Fall Trail) one by one.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click the search button or press Enter to initiate the search.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Sleep for 5 seconds to ensure the search results page is fully loaded.\n     ```sh\n     sleep 5\n     ```\n\n4. **Collect Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each trail, collect the number of reviews, average rating, and any mentions of wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for at least three different recommendations or reviews that mention full wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Report the collected information for each trail.\n\n5. **Summarize and Compile Results**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compile a list of trails that meet all the criteria (more than 1,000 reviews, 4.5/5 or higher rating, and at least three recommendations for wheelchair accessibility).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Provide the names of the trails, their average ratings, number of reviews, and any relevant comments or links to the recommendations for wheelchair accessibility.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to TripAdvisor Homepage**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the TripAdvisor homepage (`https://www.tripadvisor.com`).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Sleep for 5 seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded.\n     ```sh\n     sleep 5\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify Search Input Field**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Inspect the page to find the correct ID or class name of the search input field.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Report the ID or class name of the search input field.\n\n3. **Enter Search Terms and Initiate Search**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill the search input field with the trail name (e.g., \"Yosemite Falls Trail\").\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click the search button or press Enter to initiate the search.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Sleep for 5 seconds to ensure the search results page is fully loaded.\n     ```sh\n     sleep 5\n     ```\n\n4. **Collect Information for Each Trail**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the number of reviews, average rating, and any mentions of wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for at least three different recommendations or reviews that mention full wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Report the collected information for each trail.\n\n5. **Compile and Present Final List**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compile a list of trails that meet all the criteria.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Provide the names of the trails, their average ratings, number of reviews, and any relevant comments or links to the recommendations for wheelchair accessibility.\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to successfully gather the required information and avoid the previous issues.

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park.\n- Trails must have more than 1,000 reviews on TripAdvisor.\n- Trails must be recommended as fully accessible to wheelchairs by at least three different people.\n- Trails must have an average rating of 4.5/5 or higher on TripAdvisor.\n- Some popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park include Yosemite Falls Trail, Mist Trail, Bridalveil Fall Trail, and Wawona Point Trail.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Number of reviews for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n- Average ratings for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n- Recommendations regarding wheelchair accessibility for each trail, specifically from at least three different sources.\n- Additional popular trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park that might meet the criteria.\n- These details can be found on TripAdvisor, the official Yosemite National Park website, and possibly other travel and accessibility guides.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Which trails meet all the criteria (more than 1,000 reviews, 4.5/5 or higher rating, and at least three recommendations for wheelchair accessibility).\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: This trail is likely to meet the criteria due to its popularity and known accessibility features. It is often mentioned as being accessible to wheelchairs, particularly the lower portion.\n- **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: This trail is another strong candidate due to its short and easy nature, which makes it more likely to be accessible to wheelchairs. It is also very popular, likely to have a high number of reviews and positive ratings.\n- **Mist Trail**: Despite its popularity, it is unlikely to meet the wheelchair accessibility criteria due to its steep and rocky terrain.\n- **Wawona Point Trail**: While it offers unique views, it is less frequented and might not have enough reviews or accessibility recommendations to meet the criteria.\n- **Valley Loop Trail**: This trail is part of the Yosemite Valley and is known for its accessibility, making it a potential candidate that should be investigated further.\n- **Vernal Fall Footbridge and Nevada Fall Trail**: These trails are shorter and less strenuous compared to the Mist Trail, and might have better accessibility features. They are also popular and could have the necessary reviews and ratings.\n\n**New Educated Guesses:**\n- **Cook's Meadow Loop**: This trail is a short and flat loop in Yosemite Valley, often recommended for its accessibility. It is likely to have a high number of reviews and positive ratings, making it a strong candidate.\n- **Sentinel Dome Trail**: While not directly leading to a waterfall, it is a popular and accessible trail.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park (more than 1,000 reviews on TripAdvisor) have been recommended to be fully accessible to wheelchairs by at least three different people and are highly rated (4.5/5 or more on average)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park.\n- Trails must have more than 1,000 reviews on TripAdvisor.\n- Trails must be recommended as fully accessible to wheelchairs by at least three different people.\n- Trails must have an average rating of 4.5/5 or higher on TripAdvisor.\n- Some popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park include Yosemite Falls Trail, Mist Trail, Bridalveil Fall Trail, and Wawona Point Trail.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Number of reviews for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n- Average ratings for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n- Recommendations regarding wheelchair accessibility for each trail, specifically from at least three different sources.\n- Additional popular trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park that might meet the criteria.\n- These details can be found on TripAdvisor, the official Yosemite National Park website, and possibly other travel and accessibility guides.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Which trails meet all the criteria (more than 1,000 reviews, 4.5/5 or higher rating, and at least three recommendations for wheelchair accessibility).\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: This trail is likely to meet the criteria due to its popularity and known accessibility features. It is often mentioned as being accessible to wheelchairs, particularly the lower portion.\n- **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: This trail is another strong candidate due to its short and easy nature, which makes it more likely to be accessible to wheelchairs. It is also very popular, likely to have a high number of reviews and positive ratings.\n- **Mist Trail**: Despite its popularity, it is unlikely to meet the wheelchair accessibility criteria due to its steep and rocky terrain.\n- **Wawona Point Trail**: While it offers unique views, it is less frequented and might not have enough reviews or accessibility recommendations to meet the criteria.\n- **Valley Loop Trail**: This trail is part of the Yosemite Valley and is known for its accessibility, making it a potential candidate that should be investigated further.\n- **Vernal Fall Footbridge and Nevada Fall Trail**: These trails are shorter and less strenuous compared to the Mist Trail, and might have better accessibility features. They are also popular and could have the necessary reviews and ratings.\n- **Cook's Meadow Loop**: This trail is a short and flat loop in Yosemite Valley, often recommended for its accessibility. It is likely to have a high number of reviews and positive ratings, making it a strong candidate.\n- **Sentinel Dome Trail**: While not directly leading to a waterfall, it is a popular and accessible trail. It might be worth checking if it meets the criteria, especially if there are any indirect connections to waterfalls.\n\n**New Educated Guesses:**\n- **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: This trail is well-known for its accessibility, particularly the lower section, which is paved and flat. It is often recommended for families and individuals with mobility challenges.\n- **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: This trail is short and relatively flat, making it a good candidate for wheelchair accessibility. It is also very popular, likely to have a high number of reviews and positive ratings.\n- **Mist Trail**: While a famous and scenic trail, it is known for its steep and uneven terrain, which makes it less likely to be recommended for wheelchair users.\n- **Wawona Point Trail**: Although it offers unique views, it is less frequented and might not have the necessary reviews or accessibility recommendations.\n- **Valley Loop Trail**: This trail is part of the Yosemite Valley and is known for its accessibility, making it a potential candidate that should be investigated further.\n- **Vernal Fall Footbridge and Nevada Fall Trail**: These trails are shorter and less strenuous compared to the Mist Trail, and might have better accessibility features. They are also popular and could have the necessary reviews and ratings.\n- **Cook's Meadow Loop**: This trail is short and flat, often recommended for its accessibility. It is likely to have a high number of reviews and positive ratings, making it a strong candidate.\n- **Sentinel Dome Trail**: While not directly leading to a waterfall, it is a popular and accessible trail. It might be worth checking if it meets the criteria, especially if there are any indirect connections to waterfalls.\n\n**Additional Educated Guesses:**\n- **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: Given its popularity and known accessibility, it is highly likely to have more than 1,000 reviews and a 4.5/5 rating or higher.\n- **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: Similarly, due to its ease and popularity, it is likely to have a high number of reviews and a high rating.\n- **Cook's Meadow Loop**: This trail is frequently recommended for its accessibility and is likely to have a significant number of reviews and a high rating.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: This trail is well-documented as being accessible, with a paved path and minimal elevation changes. It is a popular destination, which increases the likelihood of meeting the review and rating criteria.\n- **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: The trail is short and flat, making it accessible to a wide range of visitors, including those with mobility challenges. Its popularity ensures a high number of reviews and a good rating.\n- **Cook's Meadow Loop**: This trail is known for its flat and easy nature, making it accessible to wheelchairs. It is a popular spot for photography and leisurely walks, which suggests a high number of reviews and positive ratings.\n\n### New Plan\n\nTo avoid the previous issues and ensure we successfully gather the required information, here is a revised plan:\n\n1. **Navigate to TripAdvisor Homepage**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the TripAdvisor homepage (`https://www.tripadvisor.com`).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Sleep for 10 seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded.\n     ```sh\n     sleep 10\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify Search Input Field**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually inspect the page to find the correct ID or class name of the search input field.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Report the ID or class name of the search input field.\n\n3. **Search for Trails**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Enter the search terms for each trail (Yosemite Falls Trail, Mist Trail, Bridalveil Fall Trail, Wawona Point Trail, Valley Loop Trail, Vernal Fall Footbridge, Nevada Fall Trail, Cook's Meadow Loop, Sentinel Dome Trail) one by one.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click the search button or press Enter to initiate the search.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Sleep for 10 seconds to ensure the search results page is fully loaded.\n     ```sh\n     sleep 10\n     ```\n\n4. **Collect Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each trail, collect the number of reviews, average rating, and any mentions of wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for at least three different recommendations or reviews that mention full wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Report the collected information for each trail.\n\n5. **Summarize and Compile Results**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compile a list of trails that meet all the criteria (more than 1,000 reviews, 4.5/5 or higher rating, and at least three recommendations for wheelchair accessibility).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Provide the names of the trails, their average ratings, number of reviews, and any relevant comments or links to the recommendations for wheelchair accessibility.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to TripAdvisor Homepage**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the TripAdvisor homepage (`https://www.tripadvisor.com`).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Sleep for 10 seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded.\n     ```sh\n     sleep 10\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify Search Input Field**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually inspect the page to find the correct ID or class name of the search input field.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Report the ID or class name of the search input field.\n\n3. **Enter Search Terms and Initiate Search**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Fill the search input field with the trail name (e.g., \"Yosemite Falls Trail\").\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click the search button or press Enter to initiate the search.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Sleep for 10 seconds to ensure the search results page is fully loaded.\n     ```sh\n     sleep 10\n     ```\n\n4. **Collect Information for Each Trail**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the number of reviews, average rating, and any mentions of wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for at least three different recommendations or reviews that mention full wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Report the collected information for each trail.\n\n5. **Compile and Present Final List**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compile a list of trails that meet all the criteria.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Provide the names of the trails, their average ratings, number of reviews, and any relevant comments or links to the recommendations for wheelchair accessibility.\n\nLet's start by navigating to the TripAdvisor homepage and identifying the search input field.\n\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\nThe primary issue encountered was that the WebSurfer was unable to locate the search input field on the TripAdvisor homepage.
