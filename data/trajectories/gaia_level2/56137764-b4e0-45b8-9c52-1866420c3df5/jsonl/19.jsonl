{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a contributor to a version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n   - The contributors to that specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - The exact spelling of the names of these contributors and former heads of government in the Latin alphabet.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Matching the names of the contributors to the specific version of OpenCV with the names of former Chinese heads of government based on their Latin alphabet transliterations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - One possible former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor's name is \"Deng Xiaoping,\" but this needs verification.\n   - Another possible name could be \"Zhou Enlai,\" but again, this needs verification.\n   - The name \"Jiang Zemin\" is another possibility, but it also requires verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Specific Version of OpenCV with Mask-RCNN Support**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find the specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n  \n- **List Contributors to the Identified Version of OpenCV**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the OpenCV GitHub repository and find the contributors to the identified version.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names of the contributors.\n\n- **List Former Chinese Heads of Government and Their Transliterated Names**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find a list of former Chinese heads of government.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Transliterate the names of these heads of government into the Latin alphabet.\n\n- **Match Contributor Names with Former Chinese Heads of Government**\n  - **Assistant**: Compare the list of contributor names with the list of former Chinese heads of government to find any matches.\n\n- **Verify the Match**\n  - **WebSurfer**: If a potential match is found, verify the match by cross-referencing additional sources if necessary.\n\n- **Report the Findings**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the findings and provide the name of the contributor who matches a former Chinese head of government."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a contributor to a version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Mask-RCNN support was added in OpenCV 4.0.0.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The contributors to OpenCV 4.0.0.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - The exact spelling of the names of these contributors and former heads of government in the Latin alphabet.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Matching the names of the contributors to OpenCV 4.0.0 with the names of former Chinese heads of government based on their Latin alphabet transliterations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - One possible former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor's name is \"Deng Xiaoping,\" but this needs verification.\n   - Another possible name could be \"Zhou Enlai,\" but again, this needs verification.\n   - The name \"Jiang Zemin\" is another possibility, but it also requires verification.\n   - Given that the contributors to OpenCV 4.0.0 are numerous, it is likely that the matching name will be a common one among Chinese names. Therefore, names like \"Li\" or \"Wang\" could also be considered, as they are very common in China.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Common Names:** Since the list of contributors is extensive, it is reasonable to consider common Chinese surnames like \"Li\" or \"Wang.\" These names are frequently used and could potentially match a contributor's name.\n- **Verification Needed:** Each of these names still needs to be verified against the actual list of contributors to ensure accuracy.\n\nNext Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the specific release page for OpenCV 4.0.0 and find the list of contributors to this version.**\n2. **Perform a web search to find a list of former Chinese heads of government and their transliterated names.**\n3. **Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government to find any matches.**\n\nLet's proceed with the next step to find the list of contributors to OpenCV 4.0.0.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Repetitive Navigation**: The repeated attempts to navigate to the specific release page for OpenCV 4.0.0 and find the list of contributors did not yield the desired information. This suggests that the approach to navigating the GitHub release page might need refinement.\n2. **Lack of Specific Action**: The instructions to the WebSurfer were not specific enough to ensure that the correct information (list of contributors) was extracted from the release page.\n3. **Overlooking Direct Links**: We might have overlooked the possibility of directly accessing the contributors list for a specific release through a more direct link or API.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Directly Access the Contributors List**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the specific release page for OpenCV 4.0.0 using the direct link: `https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0`.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the \"Contributors\" section or find a link to the contributors list for this release.\n\n2. **Extract the List of Contributors**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names of the contributors from the page. If the contributors list is not directly available, navigate to the \"Commits\" tab for the 4.0.0 release and extract the names from there.\n\n3. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find a list of former Chinese heads of government and their transliterated names in the Latin alphabet.\n\n4. **Match Names**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the list of contributors to the list of former Chinese heads of government to find any matches.\n\n5. **Verify the Match**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If a potential match is found, verify the match by cross-referencing additional sources if necessary.\n\n6. **Report the Findings**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the findings and provide the name of the contributor who matches a former Chinese head of government.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Specific Release Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the URL `https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0`.\n\n2. **Extract the List of Contributors**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the \"Contributors\" section or find a link to the contributors list for this release. If not available, navigate to the \"Commits\" tab and extract the names of contributors from the commit history.\n\n3. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"former Chinese heads of government Latin alphabet names\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and transliterations.\n\n4. **Match Names**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the extracted list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n5. **Verify the Match**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If a potential match is found, search for additional sources to verify the match.\n\n6. **Report the Findings**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the name of the contributor who matches a former Chinese head of government.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Specific Instructions**: Ensure that the instructions to the WebSurfer are specific and detailed, especially regarding the sections to look for and the actions to take.\n- **Direct Links**: Use direct links to specific pages whenever possible to avoid repetitive navigation.\n- **Cross-Verification**: Always verify potential matches with additional sources to ensure accuracy."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a contributor to a version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Mask-RCNN support was added in OpenCV 4.0.0.\n   - The specific release page for OpenCV 4.0.0 is located at: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The contributors to OpenCV 4.0.0.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - The exact spelling of the names of these contributors and former heads of government in the Latin alphabet.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Matching the names of the contributors to OpenCV 4.0.0 with the names of former Chinese heads of government based on their Latin alphabet transliterations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - One possible former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor's name is \"Deng Xiaoping,\" but this needs verification.\n   - Another possible name could be \"Zhou Enlai,\" but again, this needs verification.\n   - The name \"Jiang Zemin\" is another possibility, but it also requires verification.\n   - Given that the contributors to OpenCV 4.0.0 are numerous, it is likely that the matching name will be a common one among Chinese names. Therefore, names like \"Li\" or \"Wang\" could also be considered, as they are very common in China.\n   - **New Guess**: The name \"Li Keqiang\" is a former Chinese head of government and is a common Chinese name. This name should be checked against the contributors list.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Common Names:** Since the list of contributors is extensive, it is reasonable to consider common Chinese surnames like \"Li\" or \"Wang.\" These names are frequently used and could potentially match a contributor's name.\n- **Verification Needed:** Each of these names still needs to be verified against the actual list of contributors to ensure accuracy.\n- **New Guess**: \"Li Keqiang\" is a well-known former Chinese head of government and a common name, which increases the likelihood of a match.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the specific release page for OpenCV 4.0.0 and find the list of contributors to this version.**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Commits' tab for the OpenCV 4.0.0 release and extract the names of contributors from the commit history.\n\n2. **Perform a web search to find a list of former Chinese heads of government and their transliterated names.**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"former Chinese heads of government Latin alphabet names\" and extract the names and transliterations.\n\n3. **Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government to find any matches.**\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the extracted list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n4. **Verify the Match**\n   - **WebSurfer**: If a potential match is found, search for additional sources to verify the match.\n\n### Detailed Instructions\n1. **Navigate to the Commits Tab**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the URL https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Commits' tab to view the commit history for the 4.0.0 release.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names of the contributors from the commit history.\n\n2. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"former Chinese heads of government Latin alphabet names\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and transliterations.\n\n3. **Match Names**\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n4. **Verify the Match**\n   - **WebSurfer**: If a potential match is found, verify the match by cross-referencing additional sources.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n- **Specific Instructions**: Ensure that the instructions to the WebSurfer are specific and detailed, especially regarding the sections to look for and the actions to take.\n- **Direct Links**: Use direct links to specific pages whenever possible to avoid repetitive navigation.\n- **Cross-Verification**: Always verify potential matches with additional sources to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step to find the list of contributors to OpenCV 4.0.0.\n\n### Action\n**WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Commits' tab for the OpenCV 4.0.0 release and extract the names of contributors from the commit history.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The WebSurfer navigated to the 'Actions' tab instead of the 'Commits' tab, which led to the incorrect page being viewed.\n2. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were not specific enough to ensure that the correct tab was selected and the necessary information was extracted.\n3. **Overlooking Direct Links**: We did not use a direct link to the commit history for the specific release, which could have avoided the need for manual navigation.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the URL https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Commits' tab to view the commit history for the 4.0.0 release.\n\n2. **Extract the List of Contributors**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the commit history and extract the names of the contributors. If the list is long, scroll down to ensure all contributors are captured.\n\n3. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"former Chinese heads of government Latin alphabet names\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and transliterations.\n\n4. **Match Names**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n5. **Verify the Match**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If a potential match is found, search for additional sources to verify the match.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the URL https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Commits' tab to view the commit history for the 4.0.0 release.\n\n2. **Extract the List of Contributors**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the commit history and extract the names of the contributors. If the list is long, scroll down to ensure all contributors are captured.\n\n3. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"former Chinese heads of government Latin alphabet names\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and transliterations.\n\n4. **Match Names**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n5. **Verify the Match**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If a potential match is found, search for additional sources to verify the match.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Specific Instructions**: Ensure that the instructions to the WebSurfer are specific and detailed, especially regarding the sections to look for and the actions to take.\n- **Direct Links**: Use direct links to specific pages whenever possible to avoid repetitive navigation.\n- **Cross-Verification**: Always verify potential matches with additional sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Action\n**WebSurfer**: Open the URL https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0 and click on the 'Commits' tab to view the commit history for the 4.0.0 release. Scroll through the commit history and extract the names of the contributors. If the list is long, scroll down to ensure all contributors are captured."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a contributor to a version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Mask-RCNN support was added in OpenCV 4.0.0.\n   - The specific release page for OpenCV 4.0.0 is located at: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0.\n   - The contributors to OpenCV 4.0.0 can be found in the commit history on the 'Commits' tab of the release page.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - The exact spelling of the names of these contributors and former heads of government in the Latin alphabet.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Matching the names of the contributors to OpenCV 4.0.0 with the names of former Chinese heads of government based on their Latin alphabet transliterations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - One possible former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor's name is \"Deng Xiaoping,\" but this needs verification.\n   - Another possible name could be \"Zhou Enlai,\" but again, this needs verification.\n   - The name \"Jiang Zemin\" is another possibility, but it also requires verification.\n   - Given that the contributors to OpenCV 4.0.0 are numerous, it is likely that the matching name will be a common one among Chinese names. Therefore, names like \"Li\" or \"Wang\" could also be considered, as they are very common in China.\n   - **New Guess**: The name \"Li Keqiang\" is a former Chinese head of government and is a common Chinese name. This name should be checked against the contributors list.\n   - **New Guess**: The name \"Hu Jintao\" is another former Chinese head of government and a common name. This name should also be checked against the contributors list.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Common Names:** Since the list of contributors is extensive, it is reasonable to consider common Chinese surnames like \"Li\" or \"Wang.\" These names are frequently used and could potentially match a contributor's name.\n- **Verification Needed:** Each of these names still needs to be verified against the actual list of contributors to ensure accuracy.\n- **New Guess**: \"Li Keqiang\" and \"Hu Jintao\" are well-known former Chinese heads of government and are common names, which increases the likelihood of a match.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Extract the List of Contributors**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Commits' tab for the OpenCV 4.0.0 release and extract the names of contributors from the commit history.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the commit history to ensure all contributors are captured.\n\n2. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"former Chinese heads of government Latin alphabet names\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and transliterations.\n\n3. **Compare the Lists**\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the extracted list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n4. **Verify the Match**\n   - **WebSurfer**: If a potential match is found, search for additional sources to verify the match.\n\n### Detailed Instructions\n1. **Extract the List of Contributors**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the URL https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Commits' tab to view the commit history for the 4.0.0 release.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the commit history and extract the names of the contributors. If the list is long, scroll down to ensure all contributors are captured.\n\n2. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"former Chinese heads of government Latin alphabet names\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and transliterations.\n\n3. **Compare the Lists**\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n4. **Verify the Match**\n   - **WebSurfer**: If a potential match is found, verify the match by cross-referencing additional sources.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n- **Specific Instructions**: Ensure that the instructions to the WebSurfer are specific and detailed, especially regarding the sections to look for and the actions to take.\n- **Direct Links**: Use direct links to specific pages whenever possible to avoid repetitive navigation.\n- **Cross-Verification**: Always verify potential matches with additional sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Action\n**WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Commits' tab for the OpenCV 4.0.0 release and extract the names of contributors from the commit history. Scroll through the commit history to ensure all contributors are captured.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Excessive Context Length**:\n   - The error message indicates that the model's maximum context length is 32768 tokens, but the request exceeded this limit with 34311 tokens.\n   - This suggests that the conversation history or the data being processed is too long, causing the model to fail.\n\n2. **Repetitive Navigation**:\n   - There was a repeated attempt to navigate to the same page and extract the same information, which did not resolve the issue and only increased the context length.\n\n3. **Lack of Efficient Data Extraction**:\n   - The process of extracting contributor names from the commit history was not optimized, leading to a large amount of data being processed.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Optimize Data Extraction**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Commits' tab for the OpenCV 4.0.0 release and extract the names of contributors from the commit history.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Instead of loading the entire commit history, load and extract names in smaller batches to avoid exceeding the token limit.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the commit history in smaller increments (e.g., 100 commits at a time) and extract the names of contributors.\n\n2. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"former Chinese heads of government Latin alphabet names\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and transliterations.\n\n3. **Compare the Lists**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the extracted list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n   - **Assistant**: Focus on common Chinese names like \"Li,\" \"Wang,\" \"Deng,\" \"Zhou,\" \"Jiang,\" \"Hu,\" and \"Li Keqiang.\"\n\n4. **Verify the Match**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If a potential match is found, search for additional sources to verify the match.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Extract the List of Contributors**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the URL https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Commits' tab to view the commit history for the 4.0.0 release.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the commit history in smaller increments (e.g., 100 commits at a time) and extract the names of the contributors.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure all contributors are captured by continuing to scroll and extract names until the end of the commit history is reached.\n\n2. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"former Chinese heads of government Latin alphabet names\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and transliterations.\n\n3. **Compare the Lists**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n   - **Assistant**: Focus on common Chinese names like \"Li,\" \"Wang,\" \"Deng,\" \"Zhou,\" \"Jiang,\" \"Hu,\" and \"Li Keqiang.\"\n\n4. **Verify the Match**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If a potential match is found, search for additional sources to verify the match.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Batch Processing**: Process the commit history in smaller batches to avoid exceeding the token limit.\n- **Efficient Scrolling**: Scroll through the commit history in smaller increments to ensure all contributors are captured without overloading the context.\n- **Focus on Common Names**: Prioritize common Chinese names to increase the likelihood of finding a match.\n- **Cross-Verification**: Always verify potential matches with additional sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Action\n**WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Commits' tab for the OpenCV 4.0.0 release and extract the names of contributors from the commit history in smaller increments (e.g., 100 commits at a time). Ensure all contributors are captured."}
