Born Edward Bridge Danson III on December 29, 1947 in San Diego, California, he was raised near Flagstaff, Arizona and attended Stanford University, where he developed an interest in drama during his second year. Danson transferred to Carnegie-Mellon and earned his bachelor's degree in fine arts in 1972; initial fame as a contract player on daytime soap prompted a move to Los Angeles in 1978, where he trained at the Actor's Studio while finding steady work as a guest actor on episodic television. He received early positive notices as an ill-fated police officer in the Joseph Wambaugh-penned crime drama \"The Onion Field\" (1979), but the film's success did little for his career, and Danson soon returned to guest work, as well as a series of widely-seen television commercials for Aramis cologne. But perseverance, as well as a well-received turn as William Hurt's lawyer pal in Lawrence Kasdan's \"Body Heat\" (1981), eventually led to his breakout showcase as ex-baseball pitcher turned bar owner Sam Malone on \"Cheers.\" Though the lowest-rated program on television in its debut season, \"Cheers\" slowly built an audience over successive seasons and became one of NBC's biggest hits of the 1980s; Danson's talent for light comedy and romance - especially in concert with co-star Shelley Long's Diane Chambers - helped to make the comedy appointment television, and earned Danson 11 consecutive Emmy nominations and nine Golden Globe nods, of which he won two apiece. The success of \"Cheers\" naturally led to other acting opportunities for Danson in features, though few of these could generate similar responses from audiences save for \"3 Men and a Baby\" (1987), a charming comedy with Danson, Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg as bachelors pressed into raising an infant. However, he scored a personal triumph in a challenging role - a father convicted of incest - in the TV-movie \"Something About Amelia\" (ABC, 1984), which earned him a third Golden Globe - and remained one of television's most popular actors as \"Cheers\" drew to a close in 1993. But Danson nearly derailed his standing with a widely publicized affair with actor/comedian Whoopi Goldberg; the news of Danson leaving his second wife, Cassandra \"Casey\" Coates, who had suffered a stroke during the birth of their second child, as well as his disastrously-received appearance in blackface at a Friars Club tribute to Goldberg undid some of the goodwill generated by his work on \"Cheers.\" Though Danson remained busy in the wake of the incident, the work was largely unremarkable, save for a brief appearance in Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), though Peter Medak's \"Pontiac Moon\" (1994) would introduce him to actress Mary Steenburgen, who would become his third wife in 1995. He eventually returned to television, first in \"Ink\" (CBS, 1996-97) with Steenburgen, and later in the more successful \"Becker\" (CBS, 1998-2004), with Danson as a cantankerous doctor, and recurring appearances as a more exasperated version of himself on \"Curb Your Enthusiam\" (HBO, 2000-) But in 2007, Danson underwent something of a career renaissance when he was cast as a scandal-shrouded billionaire in the first season of \"Damages.\" His performance - equal parts charm and malevolent - wowed critics and audiences alike, and earned Danson two Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe nod. More importantly, it opened up a new venue of characters to the actor, who stepped nimbly into character roles that were far afield from Sam Malone: the prickly forensic botanist D.B. Russell, who stepped into William Petersen's shoes on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"; the giddy, pot-smoking editor friend of Jonathan Ames (Jason Schwartzman) on the cult favorite \"Bored to Death\" (HBO, 2009-2011); a phlegmatic Midwestern sheriff on Season 2 of \"Fargo\" (FX, 2014- ); and a demon with a moral crisis on \"The Good Place,\" which earned him two additional Emmy awards. In 2019, Danson was announced as the lead of a new series by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock (\"30 Rock\", NBC, 2006-2013) about a businessman who runs for mayor of Los Angeles for entirely wrong reasons. \n Show More \nHighest-Rated Movies\nSaving Private Ryan\nHearts Beat Loud\n News & Interviews for\nTed Danson 10 Shows To Watch If You Love \nOnly Murders in the Building Quentin Tarantino’s \nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood Leads Critics Choice Awards with Four Wins, including Best Picture \n 12 TV Shows You Should Binge-Watch This September \n View All\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Person\",\n        \"url\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ted_danson\",\n        \"name\": \"Ted Danson\",\n        \"birthDate\": \"1947-12-29\",\n        \"birthPlace\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Place\",\n            \"name\": \"San Diego, California, USA\"\n        },\n        \"description\": \"Explore the complete filmography of Ted Danson on Rotten Tomatoes!

Born Edward Bridge Danson III on December 29, 1947 in San Diego, California, he was raised near Flagstaff, Arizona and attended Stanford University, where he developed an interest in drama during his second year. Danson transferred to Carnegie-Mellon and earned his bachelor's degree in fine arts in 1972; initial fame as a contract player on daytime soap prompted a move to Los Angeles in 1978, where he trained at the Actor's Studio while finding steady work as a guest actor on episodic television. He received early positive notices as an ill-fated police officer in the Joseph Wambaugh-penned crime drama \"The Onion Field\" (1979), but the film's success did little for his career, and Danson soon returned to guest work, as well as a series of widely-seen television commercials for Aramis cologne. But perseverance, as well as a well-received turn as William Hurt's lawyer pal in Lawrence Kasdan's \"Body Heat\" (1981), eventually led to his breakout showcase as ex-baseball pitcher turned bar owner Sam Malone on \"Cheers.\" Though the lowest-rated program on television in its debut season, \"Cheers\" slowly built an audience over successive seasons and became one of NBC's biggest hits of the 1980s; Danson's talent for light comedy and romance - especially in concert with co-star Shelley Long's Diane Chambers - helped to make the comedy appointment television, and earned Danson 11 consecutive Emmy nominations and nine Golden Globe nods, of which he won two apiece. The success of \"Cheers\" naturally led to other acting opportunities for Danson in features, though few of these could generate similar responses from audiences save for \"3 Men and a Baby\" (1987), a charming comedy with Danson, Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg as bachelors pressed into raising an infant. However, he scored a personal triumph in a challenging role - a father convicted of incest - in the TV-movie \"Something About Amelia\" (ABC, 1984), which earned him a third Golden Globe - and remained one of television's most popular actors as \"Cheers\" drew to a close in 1993. But Danson nearly derailed his standing with a widely publicized affair with actor/comedian Whoopi Goldberg; the news of Danson leaving his second wife, Cassandra \"Casey\" Coates, who had suffered a stroke during the birth of their second child, as well as his disastrously-received appearance in blackface at a Friars Club tribute to Goldberg undid some of the goodwill generated by his work on \"Cheers.\" Though Danson remained busy in the wake of the incident, the work was largely unremarkable, save for a brief appearance in Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), though Peter Medak's \"Pontiac Moon\" (1994) would introduce him to actress Mary Steenburgen, who would become his third wife in 1995. He eventually returned to television, first in \"Ink\" (CBS, 1996-97) with Steenburgen, and later in the more successful \"Becker\" (CBS, 1998-2004), with Danson as a cantankerous doctor, and recurring appearances as a more exasperated version of himself on \"Curb Your Enthusiam\" (HBO, 2000-) But in 2007, Danson underwent something of a career renaissance when he was cast as a scandal-shrouded billionaire in the first season of \"Damages.\" His performance - equal parts charm and malevolent - wowed critics and audiences alike, and earned Danson two Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe nod. More importantly, it opened up a new venue of characters to the actor, who stepped nimbly into character roles that were far afield from Sam Malone: the prickly forensic botanist D.B. Russell, who stepped into William Petersen's shoes on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"; the giddy, pot-smoking editor friend of Jonathan Ames (Jason Schwartzman) on the cult favorite \"Bored to Death\" (HBO, 2009-2011); a phlegmatic Midwestern sheriff on Season 2 of \"Fargo\" (FX, 2014- ); and a demon with a moral crisis on \"The Good Place,\" which earned him two additional Emmy awards. In 2019, Danson was announced as the lead of a new series by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock (\"30 Rock\", NBC, 2006-2013) about a businessman who runs for mayor of Los Angeles for entirely wrong reasons. \n 96%\n 81%\nBody Heat\n 94%\n 95%\nSaving Private Ryan\n 92%\n 74%\nHearts Beat Loud\n 87%\n 65%\nThe Onion Field\n 85%\n 94%\nBest Summer Ever\n 83%\n 76%\nThe One I Love\n 78%\n 82%\nThe End of the Line\nPhotos\n View All \n Ted Danson \nFilmography\n Movies \n TV Shows \nSort By: Newest \nCelebrating Betty White: America's Golden Girl\n- -\n- -\n2022\nSelf\nThe Sleepless\n- -\n- -\n2020\nExecutive Producer\n 12 TV Shows You Should Binge-Watch This September \n View All\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the worst rated series (according to Rotten Tomatoes) with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series must be rated according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of all series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Number of seasons for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify which series among those starring Ted Danson have more than 1 season.\n   - Determine the Rotten Tomatoes rating for each eligible series.\n   - Filter out series that are not available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Compare the Rotten Tomatoes ratings of the remaining series to find the one with the lowest rating.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Ted Danson has starred in several well-known series, including \"Cheers,\" \"The Good Place,\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" but these are likely not the worst-rated.\n   - Some of his less popular or critically acclaimed series might be candidates, such as \"Bored to Death\" or \"Damages.\"\n   - \"Becker\" is another series that Ted Danson starred in, and it ran for multiple seasons. It might be worth checking its Rotten Tomatoes rating and availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" is a long-running series where Ted Danson appeared for several seasons. While it is generally well-received, specific seasons or his involvement might have different ratings.\n   - \"Damages\" is a series that Ted Danson starred in for multiple seasons. It has a mixed reception, which makes it a potential candidate for the worst-rated series.\n   - The availability of series on Amazon Prime Video (US) can change, so this information should be verified from the most recent sources.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- We need to ensure that we gather the number of seasons and Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series Ted Danson has starred in.\n- After compiling this information, we will filter out series with only one season and those not available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- Finally, we will compare the Rotten Tomatoes ratings of the remaining series to identify the worst-rated one.\n\nPlease proceed to compile the list of all TV series starring Ted Danson, verify the number of seasons, check the Rotten Tomatoes ratings, and note the availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incomplete Data Collection**: The previous attempts focused on scrolling through the page but did not systematically collect and verify the required information (number of seasons, Rotten Tomatoes ratings, and availability on Amazon Prime Video).\n2. **Lack of Structured Approach**: There was no clear step-by-step plan to ensure all necessary data points were collected and verified.\n3. **Manual Scrolling Inefficiency**: Manually scrolling through the page and trying to capture information piecemeal led to incomplete and fragmented data.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **WebSurfer: Initial Search and Compilation**\n   - Perform a web search to find a comprehensive list of all TV series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Navigate to the Rotten Tomatoes page for Ted Danson's filmography.\n   - Scroll through the page to compile a list of all TV series starring Ted Danson, including the number of seasons and Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n\n2. **WebSurfer: Verification of Series Details**\n   - For each series identified, verify the number of seasons and Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n   - Note any series that have more than 1 season and their respective ratings.\n\n3. **WebSurfer: Availability Check on Amazon Prime Video (US)**\n   - Search for each series on Amazon Prime Video (US) to verify availability.\n   - Note which series are available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n4. **Assistant: Data Compilation and Analysis**\n   - Compile the data gathered by WebSurfer into a structured list.\n   - Filter out series that do not meet the criteria (more than 1 season, starring Ted Danson, available on Amazon Prime Video, and with Rotten Tomatoes ratings).\n   - Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating from the filtered list.\n\n5. **Assistant: Final Answer**\n   - Present the final answer, including the name of the series, its Rotten Tomatoes rating, and a confirmation of its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **WebSurfer: Initial Search and Compilation**\n   - Perform a web search for \"TV series starring Ted Danson number of seasons Rotten Tomatoes ratings\".\n   - Navigate to the Rotten Tomatoes page for Ted Danson's filmography.\n   - Scroll through the page and compile a list of all TV series starring Ted Danson, including:\n     - Series Name\n     - Number of Seasons\n     - Rotten Tomatoes Rating\n\n2. **WebSurfer: Verification of Series Details**\n   - For each series identified, verify the number of seasons and Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n   - Note any series that have more than 1 season and their respective ratings.\n\n3. **WebSurfer: Availability Check on Amazon Prime Video (US)**\n   - Search for each series on Amazon Prime Video (US) to verify availability.\n   - Note which series are available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n4. **Assistant: Data Compilation and Analysis**\n   - Compile the data gathered by WebSurfer into a structured list.\n   - Filter out series that do not meet the criteria (more than 1 season, starring Ted Danson, available on Amazon Prime Video, and with Rotten Tomatoes ratings).\n   - Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating from the filtered list.\n\n5. **Assistant: Final Answer**\n   - Present the final answer, including the name of the series, its Rotten Tomatoes rating, and a confirmation of its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Systematic Data Collection**: Ensure that each piece of information (series name, number of seasons, Rotten Tomatoes rating, and availability on Amazon Prime Video) is collected and verified for every series.\n- **Structured Approach**: Follow a clear step-by-step plan to avoid missing any crucial data points.\n- **Efficient Navigation**: Use efficient navigation techniques (e.g., scrolling, searching) to gather data quickly and accurately.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

Born Edward Bridge Danson III on December 29, 1947 in San Diego, California, he was raised near Flagstaff, Arizona and attended Stanford University, where he developed an interest in drama during his second year. Danson transferred to Carnegie-Mellon and earned his bachelor's degree in fine arts in 1972; initial fame as a contract player on daytime soap prompted a move to Los Angeles in 1978, where he trained at the Actor's Studio while finding steady work as a guest actor on episodic television. He received early positive notices as an ill-fated police officer in the Joseph Wambaugh-penned crime drama \"The Onion Field\" (1979), but the film's success did little for his career, and Danson soon returned to guest work, as well as a series of widely-seen television commercials for Aramis cologne. But perseverance, as well as a well-received turn as William Hurt's lawyer pal in Lawrence Kasdan's \"Body Heat\" (1981), eventually led to his breakout showcase as ex-baseball pitcher turned bar owner Sam Malone on \"Cheers.\" Though the lowest-rated program on television in its debut season, \"Cheers\" slowly built an audience over successive seasons and became one of NBC's biggest hits of the 1980s; Danson's talent for light comedy and romance - especially in concert with co-star Shelley Long's Diane Chambers - helped to make the comedy appointment television, and earned Danson 11 consecutive Emmy nominations and nine Golden Globe nods, of which he won two apiece. The success of \"Cheers\" naturally led to other acting opportunities for Danson in features, though few of these could generate similar responses from audiences save for \"3 Men and a Baby\" (1987), a charming comedy with Danson, Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg as bachelors pressed into raising an infant. However, he scored a personal triumph in a challenging role - a father convicted of incest - in the TV-movie \"Something About Amelia\" (ABC, 1984), which earned him a third Golden Globe - and remained one of television's most popular actors as \"Cheers\" drew to a close in 1993. But Danson nearly derailed his standing with a widely publicized affair with actor/comedian Whoopi Goldberg; the news of Danson leaving his second wife, Cassandra \"Casey\" Coates, who had suffered a stroke during the birth of their second child, as well as his disastrously-received appearance in blackface at a Friars Club tribute to Goldberg undid some of the goodwill generated by his work on \"Cheers.\" Though Danson remained busy in the wake of the incident, the work was largely unremarkable, save for a brief appearance in Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), though Peter Medak's \"Pontiac Moon\" (1994) would introduce him to actress Mary Steenburgen, who would become his third wife in 1995. He eventually returned to television, first in \"Ink\" (CBS, 1996-97) with Steenburgen, and later in the more successful \"Becker\" (CBS, 1998-2004), with Danson as a cantankerous doctor, and recurring appearances as a more exasperated version of himself on \"Curb Your Enthusiam\" (HBO, 2000-) But in 2007, Danson underwent something of a career renaissance when he was cast as a scandal-shrouded billionaire in the first season of \"Damages.\" His performance - equal parts charm and malevolent - wowed critics and audiences alike, and earned Danson two Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe nod. More importantly, it opened up a new venue of characters to the actor, who stepped nimbly into character roles that were far afield from Sam Malone: the prickly forensic botanist D.B. Russell, who stepped into William Petersen's shoes on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"; the giddy, pot-smoking editor friend of Jonathan Ames (Jason Schwartzman) on the cult favorite \"Bored to Death\" (HBO, 2009-2011); a phlegmatic Midwestern sheriff on Season 2 of \"Fargo\" (FX, 2014- ); and a demon with a moral crisis on \"The Good Place,\" which earned him two additional Emmy awards.

Danson transferred to Carnegie-Mellon and earned his bachelor's degree in fine arts in 1972; initial fame as a contract player on daytime soap prompted a move to Los Angeles in 1978, where he trained at the Actor's Studio while finding steady work as a guest actor on episodic television. He received early positive notices as an ill-fated police officer in the Joseph Wambaugh-penned crime drama \"The Onion Field\" (1979), but the film's success did little for his career, and Danson soon returned to guest work, as well as a series of widely-seen television commercials for Aramis cologne. But perseverance, as well as a well-received turn as William Hurt's lawyer pal in Lawrence Kasdan's \"Body Heat\" (1981), eventually led to his breakout showcase as ex-baseball pitcher turned bar owner Sam Malone on \"Cheers.\" Though the lowest-rated program on television in its debut season, \"Cheers\" slowly built an audience over successive seasons and became one of NBC's biggest hits of the 1980s; Danson's talent for light comedy and romance - especially in concert with co-star Shelley Long's Diane Chambers - helped to make the comedy appointment television, and earned Danson 11 consecutive Emmy nominations and nine Golden Globe nods, of which he won two apiece. The success of \"Cheers\" naturally led to other acting opportunities for Danson in features, though few of these could generate similar responses from audiences save for \"3 Men and a Baby\" (1987), a charming comedy with Danson, Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg as bachelors pressed into raising an infant. However, he scored a personal triumph in a challenging role - a father convicted of incest - in the TV-movie \"Something About Amelia\" (ABC, 1984), which earned him a third Golden Globe - and remained one of television's most popular actors as \"Cheers\" drew to a close in 1993. But Danson nearly derailed his standing with a widely publicized affair with actor/comedian Whoopi Goldberg; the news of Danson leaving his second wife, Cassandra \"Casey\" Coates, who had suffered a stroke during the birth of their second child, as well as his disastrously-received appearance in blackface at a Friars Club tribute to Goldberg undid some of the goodwill generated by his work on \"Cheers.\" Though Danson remained busy in the wake of the incident, the work was largely unremarkable, save for a brief appearance in Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), though Peter Medak's \"Pontiac Moon\" (1994) would introduce him to actress Mary Steenburgen, who would become his third wife in 1995. He eventually returned to television, first in \"Ink\" (CBS, 1996-97) with Steenburgen, and later in the more successful \"Becker\" (CBS, 1998-2004), with Danson as a cantankerous doctor, and recurring appearances as a more exasperated version of himself on \"Curb Your Enthusiam\" (HBO, 2000-) But in 2007, Danson underwent something of a career renaissance when he was cast as a scandal-shrouded billionaire in the first season of \"Damages.\" His performance - equal parts charm and malevolent - wowed critics and audiences alike, and earned Danson two Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe nod. More importantly, it opened up a new venue of characters to the actor, who stepped nimbly into character roles that were far afield from Sam Malone: the prickly forensic botanist D.B. Russell, who stepped into William Petersen's shoes on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"; the giddy, pot-smoking editor friend of Jonathan Ames (Jason Schwartzman) on the cult favorite \"Bored to Death\" (HBO, 2009-2011); a phlegmatic Midwestern sheriff on Season 2 of \"Fargo\" (FX, 2014- ); and a demon with a moral crisis on \"The Good Place,\" which earned him two additional Emmy awards. In 2019, Danson was announced as the lead of a new series by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock (\"30 Rock\", NBC, 2006-2013) about a businessman who runs for mayor of Los Angeles for entirely wrong reasons. \n 96%\n 81%\nBody Heat\n 94%\n 95%\nSaving Private Ryan\n 92%\n 74%\nHearts Beat Loud\n 87%\n 65%\nThe Onion Field\n 85%\n 94%\nBest Summer Ever\n 83%\n 76%\nThe One I Love\n 78%\n 82%\nThe End of the Line\nPhotos\n View All \n Ted Danson \nFilmography\n Movies \n TV Shows \nSort By: Newest \nCelebrating Betty White: America's Golden Girl\n- -\n- -\n2022\nSelf\nThe Sleepless\n- -\n- -\n2020\nExecutive Producer\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series must be rated according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of all series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Number of seasons for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify which series among those starring Ted Danson have more than 1 season.\n   - Determine the Rotten Tomatoes rating for each eligible series.\n   - Filter out series that are not available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Compare the Rotten Tomatoes ratings of the remaining series to find the one with the lowest rating.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **\"Cheers\"** (1982-1993): This is one of Ted Danson's most famous series, running for 11 seasons. It is highly rated and likely available on multiple platforms, including Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **\"The Good Place\"** (2016-2020): This series ran for 4 seasons and is generally well-received. It is available on various streaming platforms, including Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\"** (2000-present): Ted Danson has appeared in multiple episodes, but it is primarily an HBO series. It is available on HBO Max and possibly on Amazon Prime Video (US) through add-ons.\n   - **\"Becker\"** (1998-2004): This series ran for 7 seasons and has a mixed reception. It is a strong candidate for being the worst-rated series with more than 1 season. Verify its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"** (2000-2015): Ted Danson appeared in multiple seasons. While the series is generally well-received, specific seasons or his involvement might have different ratings. Verify its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **\"Damages\"** (2007-2012): This series ran for 5 seasons and has a mixed reception. It is a potential candidate for the worst-rated series. Verify its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **\"Bored to Death\"** (2009-2011): This series ran for 3 seasons and has a mixed reception. It is another potential candidate. Verify its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- **\"Cheers\"** and **\"The Good Place\"** are highly rated and likely not the worst-rated series.\n- **\"Becker\"**, **\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"**, **\"Damages\"**, and **\"Bored to Death\"** are less critically acclaimed and have more variability in their ratings, making them stronger candidates for the worst-rated series.\n- The availability of series on Amazon Prime Video (US) can change, so this information should be verified from the most recent sources.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **WebSurfer: Initial Search and Compilation**\n   -

Born Edward Bridge Danson III on December 29, 1947 in San Diego, California, he was raised near Flagstaff, Arizona and attended Stanford University, where he developed an interest in drama during his second year. Danson transferred to Carnegie-Mellon and earned his bachelor's degree in fine arts in 1972; initial fame as a contract player on daytime soap prompted a move to Los Angeles in 1978, where he trained at the Actor's Studio while finding steady work as a guest actor on episodic television. He received early positive notices as an ill-fated police officer in the Joseph Wambaugh-penned crime drama \"The Onion Field\" (1979), but the film's success did little for his career, and Danson soon returned to guest work, as well as a series of widely-seen television commercials for Aramis cologne. But perseverance, as well as a well-received turn as William Hurt's lawyer pal in Lawrence Kasdan's \"Body Heat\" (1981), eventually led to his breakout showcase as ex-baseball pitcher turned bar owner Sam Malone on \"Cheers.\" Though the lowest-rated program on television in its debut season, \"Cheers\" slowly built an audience over successive seasons and became one of NBC's biggest hits of the 1980s; Danson's talent for light comedy and romance - especially in concert with co-star Shelley Long's Diane Chambers - helped to make the comedy appointment television, and earned Danson 11 consecutive Emmy nominations and nine Golden Globe nods, of which he won two apiece. The success of \"Cheers\" naturally led to other acting opportunities for Danson in features, though few of these could generate similar responses from audiences save for \"3 Men and a Baby\" (1987), a charming comedy with Danson, Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg as bachelors pressed into raising an infant. However, he scored a personal triumph in a challenging role - a father convicted of incest - in the TV-movie \"Something About Amelia\" (ABC, 1984), which earned him a third Golden Globe - and remained one of television's most popular actors as \"Cheers\" drew to a close in 1993. But Danson nearly derailed his standing with a widely publicized affair with actor/comedian Whoopi Goldberg; the news of Danson leaving his second wife, Cassandra \"Casey\" Coates, who had suffered a stroke during the birth of their second child, as well as his disastrously-received appearance in blackface at a Friars Club tribute to Goldberg undid some of the goodwill generated by his work on \"Cheers.\" Though Danson remained busy in the wake of the incident, the work was largely unremarkable, save for a brief appearance in Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), though Peter Medak's \"Pontiac Moon\" (1994) would introduce him to actress Mary Steenburgen, who would become his third wife in 1995. He eventually returned to television, first in \"Ink\" (CBS, 1996-97) with Steenburgen, and later in the more successful \"Becker\" (CBS, 1998-2004), with Danson as a cantankerous doctor, and recurring appearances as a more exasperated version of himself on \"Curb Your Enthusiam\" (HBO, 2000-) But in 2007, Danson underwent something of a career renaissance when he was cast as a scandal-shrouded billionaire in the first season of \"Damages.\" His performance - equal parts charm and malevolent - wowed critics and audiences alike, and earned Danson two Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe nod. More importantly, it opened up a new venue of characters to the actor, who stepped nimbly into character roles that were far afield from Sam Malone: the prickly forensic botanist D.B. Russell, who stepped into William Petersen's shoes on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"; the giddy, pot-smoking editor friend of Jonathan Ames (Jason Schwartzman) on the cult favorite \"Bored to Death\" (HBO, 2009-2011); a phlegmatic Midwestern sheriff on Season 2 of \"Fargo\" (FX, 2014- ); and a demon with a moral crisis on \"The Good Place,\" which earned him two additional Emmy awards. In 2019, Danson was announced as the lead of a new series by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock (\"30 Rock\", NBC, 2006-2013) about a businessman who runs for mayor of Los Angeles for entirely wrong reasons. \n Show More \nHighest-Rated Movies\nSaving Private Ryan\nHearts Beat Loud\n News & Interviews for\nTed Danson 10 Shows To Watch If You Love \nOnly Murders in the Building Quentin Tarantino’s \nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood Leads Critics Choice Awards with Four Wins, including Best Picture \n 12 TV Shows You Should Binge-Watch This September \n View All\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Person\",\n        \"url\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ted_danson\",\n        \"name\": \"Ted Danson\",\n        \"birthDate\": \"1947-12-29\",\n        \"birthPlace\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Place\",\n            \"name\": \"San Diego, California, USA\"\n        },\n        \"description\": \"Explore the complete filmography of Ted Danson on Rotten Tomatoes!

Born Edward Bridge Danson III on December 29, 1947 in San Diego, California, he was raised near Flagstaff, Arizona and attended Stanford University, where he developed an interest in drama during his second year. Danson transferred to Carnegie-Mellon and earned his bachelor's degree in fine arts in 1972; initial fame as a contract player on daytime soap prompted a move to Los Angeles in 1978, where he trained at the Actor's Studio while finding steady work as a guest actor on episodic television. He received early positive notices as an ill-fated police officer in the Joseph Wambaugh-penned crime drama \"The Onion Field\" (1979), but the film's success did little for his career, and Danson soon returned to guest work, as well as a series of widely-seen television commercials for Aramis cologne. But perseverance, as well as a well-received turn as William Hurt's lawyer pal in Lawrence Kasdan's \"Body Heat\" (1981), eventually led to his breakout showcase as ex-baseball pitcher turned bar owner Sam Malone on \"Cheers.\" Though the lowest-rated program on television in its debut season, \"Cheers\" slowly built an audience over successive seasons and became one of NBC's biggest hits of the 1980s; Danson's talent for light comedy and romance - especially in concert with co-star Shelley Long's Diane Chambers - helped to make the comedy appointment television, and earned Danson 11 consecutive Emmy nominations and nine Golden Globe nods, of which he won two apiece. The success of \"Cheers\" naturally led to other acting opportunities for Danson in features, though few of these could generate similar responses from audiences save for \"3 Men and a Baby\" (1987), a charming comedy with Danson, Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg as bachelors pressed into raising an infant. However, he scored a personal triumph in a challenging role - a father convicted of incest - in the TV-movie \"Something About Amelia\" (ABC, 1984), which earned him a third Golden Globe - and remained one of television's most popular actors as \"Cheers\" drew to a close in 1993. But Danson nearly derailed his standing with a widely publicized affair with actor/comedian Whoopi Goldberg; the news of Danson leaving his second wife, Cassandra \"Casey\" Coates, who had suffered a stroke during the birth of their second child, as well as his disastrously-received appearance in blackface at a Friars Club tribute to Goldberg undid some of the goodwill generated by his work on \"Cheers.\" Though Danson remained busy in the wake of the incident, the work was largely unremarkable, save for a brief appearance in Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), though Peter Medak's \"Pontiac Moon\" (1994) would introduce him to actress Mary Steenburgen, who would become his third wife in 1995. He eventually returned to television, first in \"Ink\" (CBS, 1996-97) with Steenburgen, and later in the more successful \"Becker\" (CBS, 1998-2004), with Danson as a cantankerous doctor, and recurring appearances as a more exasperated version of himself on \"Curb Your Enthusiam\" (HBO, 2000-) But in 2007, Danson underwent something of a career renaissance when he was cast as a scandal-shrouded billionaire in the first season of \"Damages.\" His performance - equal parts charm and malevolent - wowed critics and audiences alike, and earned Danson two Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe nod. More importantly, it opened up a new venue of characters to the actor, who stepped nimbly into character roles that were far afield from Sam Malone: the prickly forensic botanist D.B. Russell, who stepped into William Petersen's shoes on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"; the giddy, pot-smoking editor friend of Jonathan Ames (Jason Schwartzman) on the cult favorite \"Bored to Death\" (HBO, 2009-2011); a phlegmatic Midwestern sheriff on Season 2 of \"Fargo\" (FX, 2014- ); and a demon with a moral crisis on \"The Good Place,\" which earned him two additional Emmy awards. In 2019, Danson was announced as the lead of a new series by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock (\"30 Rock\", NBC, 2006-2013) about a businessman who runs for mayor of Los Angeles for entirely wrong reasons. \n 96%\n 81%\nBody Heat\n 94%\n 95%\nSaving Private Ryan\n 92%\n 74%\nHearts Beat Loud\n 87%\n 65%\nThe Onion Field\n 85%\n 94%\nBest Summer Ever\n 83%\n 76%\nThe One I Love\n 78%\n 82%\nThe End of the Line\nPhotos\n View All \n Ted Danson \nFilmography\n Movies \n TV Shows \nSort By: Newest \nCelebrating Betty White: America's Golden Girl\n- -\n- -\n2022\nSelf\nThe Sleepless\n- -\n- -\n2020\nExecutive Producer\n 12 TV Shows You Should Binge-Watch This September \n View All\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the worst rated series (according to Rotten Tomatoes) with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The series must have more than 1 season.\n- Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n- The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- The series must be rated according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- List of all series starring Ted Danson.\n- Number of seasons for each series starring Ted Danson.\n- Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series starring Ted Danson.\n- Availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Identify which series among those starring Ted Danson have more than 1 season.\n- Determine the Rotten Tomatoes rating for each eligible series.\n- Filter out series that are not available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- Compare the Rotten Tomatoes ratings of the remaining series to find the one with the lowest rating.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **\"Cheers\"** (1982-1993): This is one of Ted Danson's most famous series, running for 11 seasons. It is highly rated and likely available on multiple platforms, including Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **\"The Good Place\"** (2016-2020): This series ran for 4 seasons and is generally well-received. It is available on various streaming platforms, including Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\"** (2000-present): Ted Danson has appeared in multiple episodes, but it is primarily an HBO series. It is available on HBO Max and possibly on Amazon Prime Video (US) through add-ons.\n- **\"Becker\"** (1998-2004): This series ran for 7 seasons and has a mixed reception. It is a strong candidate for being the worst-rated series with more than 1 season. Verify its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"** (2000-2015): Ted Danson appeared in multiple seasons. While the series is generally well-received, specific seasons or his involvement might have different ratings. Verify its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **\"Damages\"** (2007-2012): This series ran for 5 seasons and has a mixed reception. It is a potential candidate for the worst-rated series. Verify its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **\"Bored to Death\"** (2009-2011): This series ran for 3 seasons and has a mixed reception. It is another potential candidate. Verify its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- **\"Cheers\"** and **\"The Good Place\"** are highly rated and likely not the worst-rated series.\n- **\"Becker\"**, **\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"**, **\"Damages\"**, and **\"Bored to Death\"** are less critically acclaimed and have more variability in their ratings, making them stronger candidates for the worst-rated series.\n- The availability of series on Amazon Prime Video (US) can change, so this information should be verified from the most recent sources.\n\n### New Educated Guesses\n- **\"Becker\"** (1998-2004): Given its mixed reception and the fact that it ran for 7 seasons, it is a strong candidate for the worst-rated series with more than 1 season. Its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US) should be confirmed.\n- **\"Damages\"** (2007-2012): Despite some positive reviews, the series has a mixed reception, particularly in later seasons. It is another strong candidate. Verify its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **\"Bored to Death\"** (2009-2011): While generally well-received, it has some mixed reviews and ran for 3 seasons. It is a potential candidate. Confirm its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **WebSurfer: Initial Search and Compilation**\n   - Perform a web search for \"TV series starring Ted Danson number of seasons Rotten Tomatoes ratings\".\n   -
