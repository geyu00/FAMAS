{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - There was a diagram of an X-ray time profile in this paper.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts in July 2020.\n   - The user is looking for the difference in seconds in the measured time span between these two diagrams.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact measured time span in seconds for the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact measured time span in seconds for the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - These details can be found in the respective papers on Arxiv.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans once the values are obtained from the papers.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The difference in seconds is likely to be a small number, as both papers are dealing with fast radio bursts, which typically have very short durations.\n   - The specific authors involved in both papers could provide additional context if their research focuses on similar time scales.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** WebSurfer will search for the March 2021 paper on Arxiv and locate the X-ray time profile diagram.\n- **Step 2:** WebSurfer will search for the July 2020 paper on Arxiv and locate the burst-1 diagram.\n- **Step 3:** WebSurfer will extract the measured time spans in seconds for both diagrams from the respective papers.\n- **Step 4:** Assistant will calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n- **Step 5:** Assistant will provide the final answer."}

Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks to be the only viable strategy. Additionally, small/medium size radiotelescopes co-pointing higher energies telescopes look a very interesting and cheap complementary observational strategy. \nComments:\n44 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication on Universe\nSubjects:\nHigh Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)Cite as:\narXiv:2103.07786 [astro-ph.HE] \n(or \narXiv:2103.07786v2 [astro-ph.HE] for this version) \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2103.07786\nFocus to learn more\nJournal reference:\nUniverse 2021, 7, 76\nRelated DOI: \nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/universe7030076\nFocus to learn more\nSubmission history\n From: Luciano Nicastro Dr. [\nview email] \n[v1] Sat, 13 Mar 2021 20:39:49 UTC (14,577 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 25 Mar 2021 10:44:14 UTC (1,195 KB)\nAccess Paper:\nView PDFTeX SourceOther Formatsview license Current browse context: \nastro-ph.HE\n< prev  |  \nnext >new \n | recent \n | 2021-03 Change to browse by: \nastro-phReferences & Citations\nINSPIRE HEPNASA ADSGoogle ScholarSemantic Scholarexport BibTeX citation\nBookmark\n Bibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer \nCode, Data, Media\nDemos\nRelated Papers\n About arXivLabs\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"msapplication-TileColor\": \"#da532c\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"description\": \"Abstract page for arXiv paper 2103.07786: Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"arXiv.org\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786v2\",\n        \"og:image\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:secure_url\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"1200\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"700\",\n        \"og:image:alt\": \"arXiv logo\",\n        \"og:description\": \"The origin and phenomenology of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) remains unknown despite more than a decade of efforts.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - There was a diagram of an X-ray time profile in this paper.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts in July 2020.\n   - The user is looking for the difference in seconds in the measured time span between these two diagrams.\n   - The March 2021 paper is titled \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\" and can be found at [arXiv:2103.07786](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact measured time span in seconds for the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact measured time span in seconds for the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - These details can be found in the respective papers on Arxiv.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans once the values are obtained from the papers.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The difference in seconds is likely to be a small number, as both papers are dealing with fast radio bursts, which typically have very short durations.\n   - The specific authors involved in both papers could provide additional context if their research focuses on similar time scales.\n   - The March 2021 paper likely contains detailed descriptions of the X-ray time profile, including the measured time span, which can be found by searching the PDF for relevant keywords such as \"X-ray time profile\" or \"time span\".\n   - The July 2020 paper might be part of a series of studies by the same authors, and thus, the burst-1 diagram and its time span should be similarly documented. Searching for the author names and the term \"burst-1\" in the July 2020 paper should help locate the required information.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n1. **Step 1:** Navigate back to the March 2021 paper on Arxiv and use the search function within the PDF to find 'X-ray time profile'. Once you find the diagram, note the measured time span in seconds.\n2. **Step 2:** Search for the July 2020 paper on Arxiv using the author names and the term \"burst-1\". Once you find the paper, locate the burst-1 diagram and note the measured time span in seconds.\n3. **Step 3:** Calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n4. **Step 4:** Provide the final answer.\n\nLet's proceed with Step 1. Navigate back to the March 2021 paper on Arxiv and use the search function within the PDF to find 'X-ray time profile'. Once you find the diagram, note the measured time span in seconds.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: Instead of navigating back to the March 2021 paper, the search function was used on the Arxiv homepage, which led to a list of search results rather than the specific paper.\n2. **Lack of Specificity**: The search terms used were too broad, leading to irrelevant results.\n3. **Inefficient Use of Resources**: The plan did not specify clear actions for each step, leading to confusion and missteps.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Navigate Back to the March 2021 Paper**:\n   - WebSurfer: Navigate back to the March 2021 paper on Arxiv ([arXiv:2103.07786](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786)).\n   - WebSurfer: Click on the \"PDF\" link to open the PDF version of the paper.\n   - WebSurfer: Use the search function within the PDF to find 'X-ray time profile'.\n   - WebSurfer: Locate the X-ray time profile diagram and note the measured time span in seconds.\n\n2. **Search for the July 2020 Paper**:\n   - WebSurfer: Perform a web search for the July 2020 paper using the author names and the term \"burst-1\".\n   - WebSurfer: Open the relevant paper on Arxiv.\n   - WebSurfer: Click on the \"PDF\" link to open the PDF version of the paper.\n   - WebSurfer: Use the search function within the PDF to find 'burst-1'.\n   - WebSurfer: Locate the burst-1 diagram and note the measured time span in seconds.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Assistant: Calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n   - Assistant: Provide the final answer.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n- **Step 1: Navigate Back to the March 2021 Paper**\n  - WebSurfer: Go to [arXiv:2103.07786](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786).\n  - WebSurfer: Click on the \"PDF\" link to open the PDF.\n  - WebSurfer: Use the search function within the PDF to find 'X-ray time profile'.\n  - WebSurfer: Locate the X-ray time profile diagram and note the measured time span in seconds.\n\n- **Step 2: Search for the July 2020 Paper**\n  - WebSurfer: Perform a web search for \"Cristiano Guidorzi burst-1 July 2020\".\n  - WebSurfer: Open the relevant paper on Arxiv.\n  - WebSurfer: Click on the \"PDF\" link to open the PDF.\n  - WebSurfer: Use the search function within the PDF to find 'burst-1'.\n  - WebSurfer: Locate the burst-1 diagram and note the measured time span in seconds.\n\n- **Step 3: Calculate the Difference**\n  - Assistant: Subtract the measured time span of the burst-1 diagram from the measured time span of the X-ray time profile.\n  - Assistant: Provide the final answer.\n\nLet's start with Step 1. Navigate back to the March 2021 paper on Arxiv and use the search function within the PDF to find 'X-ray time profile'. Once you find the diagram, note the measured time span in seconds."}

Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - There was a diagram of an X-ray time profile in this paper.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts in July 2020.\n   - The user is looking for the difference in seconds in the measured time span between these two diagrams.\n   - The March 2021 paper is titled \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\" and can be found at [arXiv:2103.07786](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact measured time span in seconds for the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact measured time span in seconds for the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - These details can be found in the respective papers on Arxiv.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans once the values are obtained from the papers.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The difference in seconds is likely to be a small number, as both papers are dealing with fast radio bursts, which typically have very short durations.\n   - The specific authors involved in both papers could provide additional context if their research focuses on similar time scales.\n   - The March 2021 paper likely contains detailed descriptions of the X-ray time profile, including the measured time span, which can be found by searching the PDF for relevant keywords such as \"X-ray time profile\" or \"time span\".\n   - The July 2020 paper might be part of a series of studies by the same authors, and thus, the burst-1 diagram and its time span should be similarly documented. Searching for the author names and the term \"burst-1\" in the July 2020 paper should help locate the required information.\n   - The X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper might be discussed in the context of multiwavelength observations, which could provide additional clues about the time span.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n1. **Step 1:** Navigate back to the March 2021 paper on Arxiv and use the search function within the PDF to find 'X-ray time profile'. Once you find the diagram, note the measured time span in seconds.\n2. **Step 2:** Search for the July 2020 paper on Arxiv using the author names and the term \"burst-1\". Once you find the paper, locate the burst-1 diagram and note the measured time span in seconds.\n3. **Step 3:** Calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n4. **Step 4:** Provide the final answer.\n\nLet's proceed with Step 1. Navigate back to the March 2021 paper on Arxiv and use the search function within the PDF to find 'X-ray time profile'. Once you find the diagram, note the measured time span in seconds.\n\n### Action:\nClick on the 'PDF' link to open the PDF version of the March 2021 paper.

Introduction\n\nThe multiwavelength (MWL) approach to study transient astronomical events has demonstrated its\neffectiveness in solving many puzzles in astronomy, both related to ‚Äúlocal‚Äù and extragalactic sources. The\nGamma Ray Burst (GRB) phenomenon represents a perfect example. Wide area detectors (e.g., high-energy\nmonitors) or speciÔ¨Åc surveys monitoring large areas of the sky can detect events that only last for a short\nperiod of time. Being able to reduce positional uncertainties and perform timely MWL observations\nusing sensitive and high-enough resolution instruments could be the only way to discriminate among\nthe possible progenitors. This is a key point when the transient astronomical event is only detected in a\n\nUniverse 2021, 7, 76; doi:10.3390/universe7030076\n\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/universe\n\n\fUniverse 2021, 7, 76\n\n2 of 48\n\nsingle band of the electromagnetic spectrum or when multiple sources could produce that event. Studying\nthe source emission in a as wide as possible spectral band justiÔ¨Åes huge efforts in terms of observational\ntime and manpower. It, typically, turns out to be the only way to solve the most challenging questions in\nastrophysics.\n\nFast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are among the most studied astrophysical transients, still their origin and\nwhether there are multiple types of progenitors and emission mechanisms are still open questions (see [1‚Äì5]\nfor a review). Are (apparently) one-off and repeating events representative of distinct samples or are they\nthe realization of a very wide timescales distribution of the same objects class? Can the periodicity seen in\na few FRBs be reconciled with the proposed models? Is the behavior distinctive of a class or sub-class of\nFRBs? Of the about 140 distinct sources known [https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/] (accessed on 1 March 2021)\n(but we are aware that many more have been discovered but remain unpublished at the time of writing this\nreview), only for a bunch of them a MWL search campaign was possible, in particular for the two repeating\n(and periodic) sources FRB 20121102A (commonly referred as FRB 121102) and FRB 20180916B (also referred\nas FRB 180916 and FRB 180916.J0158+65, see below for the details). What makes FRB searches even more\nchallenging than for other transients"}
