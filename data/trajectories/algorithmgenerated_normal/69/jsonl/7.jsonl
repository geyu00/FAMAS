Unfortunately, this means we cannot retrieve the content directly from this video using automated tools.\n\nAs an alternative, I recommend the following steps:\n1. Manually check the video on YouTube by watching it to find Teal'c's response to the question \"Isn't that hot?\"\n2. If subtitles are available on the video, they can be enabled for easier understanding of the dialogue.\n\nIf there's a specific part of the video you want to analyze further, we can explore other methods or tools, but for now, manual verification seems to be the only viable option.\n\nIf any other solutions or ideas arise, please feel free to share!"}
