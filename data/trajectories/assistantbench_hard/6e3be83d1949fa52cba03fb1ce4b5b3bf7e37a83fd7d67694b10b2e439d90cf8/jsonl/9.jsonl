Martial arts is something that you become– it must be a lifestyle that comes to life through a process of training, which forces you (the martial artist) to evolve your thinking, imagination, and creativity. The techniques and progressions that you learn that make you into a martial artist do not change– they are forever still in the current of time. But you, the martial artist must constantly be moving, changing, and evolving yourself through the application of the progressions and techniques passed down through the ages so that you are continuously chasing the unattainable idea of perfection.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@graph\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Place\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#place\",\n                \"address\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"PostalAddress\",\n                    \"streetAddress\": \"30 Broad Street\",\n                    \"addressLocality\": \"New York\",\n                    \"addressRegion\": \"New York\",\n                    \"postalCode\": \"10004\",\n                    \"addressCountry\": \"USA\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": [\n                    \"LocalBusiness\",\n                    \"Organization\"\n                ],\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#organization\",\n                \"name\": \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com\",\n                \"address\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"PostalAddress\",\n                    \"streetAddress\": \"30 Broad Street\",\n                    \"addressLocality\": \"New York\",\n                    \"addressRegion\": \"New York\",\n                    \"postalCode\": \"10004\",\n                    \"addressCountry\": \"USA\"\n                },\n                \"logo\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#logo\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cropped-Aims-chest-white-1.png\",\n                    \"contentUrl\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cropped-Aims-chest-white-1.png\",\n                    \"caption\": \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\",\n                    \"inLanguage\": \"en-US\",\n                    \"width\": \"512\",\n                    \"height\": \"512\"\n                },\n                \"openingHours\": [\n                    \"Monday,Wednesday,Friday 16:00-20:00\"\n                ],\n                \"location\": {\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#place\"\n                },\n                \"image\": {\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#logo\"\n                },\n                \"telephone\": \"+1-231-391-3511\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"WebSite\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#website\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com\",\n                \"name\": \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\",\n                \"alternateName\": \"AIMS\",\n                \"publisher\": {\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#organization\"\n                },\n                \"inLanguage\": \"en-US\",\n                \"potentialAction\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"SearchAction\",\n                    \"target\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/?s={search_term_string}\",\n                    \"query-input\": \"required name=search_term_string\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/aimslogo.svg\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/aimslogo.svg\",\n                \"width\": \"200\",\n                \"height\": \"200\",\n                \"inLanguage\": \"en-US\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#webpage\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/\",\n                \"name\": \"AIMS Martial Arts -

Martial arts is something that you become– it must be a lifestyle that comes to life through a process of training, which forces you (the martial artist) to evolve your thinking, imagination, and creativity. The techniques and progressions that you learn that make you into a martial artist do not change– they are forever still in the current of time.

The techniques and progressions that you learn that make you into a martial artist do not change– they are forever still in the current of time. But you, the martial artist must constantly be moving, changing, and evolving yourself through the application of the progressions and techniques passed down through the ages so that you are continuously chasing the unattainable idea of perfection.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@graph\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Place\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#place\",\n                \"address\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"PostalAddress\",\n                    \"streetAddress\": \"30 Broad Street\",\n                    \"addressLocality\": \"New York\",\n                    \"addressRegion\": \"New York\",\n                    \"postalCode\": \"10004\",\n                    \"addressCountry\": \"USA\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": [\n                    \"LocalBusiness\",\n                    \"Organization\"\n                ],\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#organization\",\n                \"name\": \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com\",\n                \"address\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"PostalAddress\",\n                    \"streetAddress\": \"30 Broad Street\",\n                    \"addressLocality\": \"New York\",\n                    \"addressRegion\": \"New York\",\n                    \"postalCode\": \"10004\",\n                    \"addressCountry\": \"USA\"\n                },\n                \"logo\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#logo\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cropped-Aims-chest-white-1.png\",\n                    \"contentUrl\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cropped-Aims-chest-white-1.png\",\n                    \"caption\": \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\",\n                    \"inLanguage\": \"en-US\",\n                    \"width\": \"512\",\n                    \"height\": \"512\"\n                },\n                \"openingHours\": [\n                    \"Monday,Wednesday,Friday 16:00-20:00\"\n                ],\n                \"location\": {\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#place\"\n                },\n                \"image\": {\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#logo\"\n                },\n                \"telephone\": \"+1-231-391-3511\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"WebSite\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#website\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com\",\n                \"name\": \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\",\n                \"alternateName\": \"AIMS\",\n                \"publisher\": {\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#organization\"\n                },\n                \"inLanguage\": \"en-US\",\n                \"potentialAction\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"SearchAction\",\n                    \"target\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/?s={search_term_string}\",\n                    \"query-input\": \"required name=search_term_string\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/aimslogo.svg\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/aimslogo.svg\",\n                \"width\": \"200\",\n                \"height\": \"200\",\n                \"inLanguage\": \"en-US\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#webpage\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/\",\n                \"name\": \"AIMS Martial Arts -

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The desired time for martial arts classes is between 7-9 pm.\n   - The classes are intended to be taken after work.\n   - **Specific Martial Arts Studios**:\n     - **Academy of Integrated Martial Systems (AIMS)**: Located at 30 Broad St, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10004.\n     - **Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street**: Located at 22 New St, New York, NY 10005.\n   - **Walking Distances**:\n     - Academy of Integrated Martial Systems is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n     - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - **Operating Hours**:\n     - Academy of Integrated Martial Systems: Open on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM.\n     - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street: Open from 5:45 AM to 9:00 PM on weekdays.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Class schedules for AIMS and Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, particularly those offered between 7-9 pm.\n   - Reviews or ratings of these studios to ensure quality and suitability.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Studio websites or Yelp for class schedules and reviews.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact walking distance (in minutes) from the New York Stock Exchange to each potential martial arts studio.\n   - The availability of classes specifically during the 7-9 pm time slot.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Class Availability**:\n     - Given the operating hours of both studios, it is likely that they offer evening classes to cater to working professionals.\n     - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street operates until 9:00 PM on weekdays, increasing the likelihood of classes being available between 7-9 pm.\n   - **Class Types**:\n     - AIMS offers a variety of martial arts styles, including Jeet Kune Do, Muay Thai, Kali, and Jiu-Jitsu.\n     - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street specializes in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu but may also offer other related martial arts classes.\n   - **Quality and Suitability**:\n     - Both studios have positive reviews, suggesting they are well-regarded and suitable for professional adults.\n     - The cleanliness and welcoming atmosphere mentioned in reviews indicate a good environment for learning and training.\n\nBy focusing on the class schedules and reviews of these two studios, we can better determine which one offers the best fit for evening martial arts classes after work.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues**: The 'Schedule' page on the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website did not load correctly, leading to repeated attempts without success.\n2. **Inefficient Search**: The initial search for class schedules on the AIMS Martial Arts website was not thorough enough, and we did not explore all available sections.\n3. **Lack of Verification**: We did not verify the exact walking distances and class schedules in a systematic manner, leading to incomplete information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Verify Walking Distances**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use Google Maps to verify the walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to both AIMS Martial Arts and Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street.\n   - **Hint**: Ensure the walking routes are saved for quick reference.\n\n2. **Thoroughly Check AIMS Martial Arts Schedule**:\n   -

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The desired time for martial arts classes is between 7-9 pm.\n   - The classes are intended to be taken after work.\n   - **Specific Martial Arts Studios**:\n     - **Academy of Integrated Martial Systems (AIMS)**: Located at 30 Broad St, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10004.\n     - **Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street**: Located at 22 New St, New York, NY 10005.\n   - **Walking Distances**:\n     - Academy of Integrated Martial Systems is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n     - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - **Operating Hours**:\n     - Academy of Integrated Martial Systems: Open on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM.\n     - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street: Open from 5:45 AM to 9:00 PM on weekdays.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Class schedules for AIMS and Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, particularly those offered between 7-9 pm.\n   - Reviews or ratings of these studios to ensure quality and suitability.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Studio websites or Yelp for class schedules and reviews.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact walking distance (in minutes) from the New York Stock Exchange to each potential martial arts studio.\n   - The availability of classes specifically during the 7-9 pm time slot.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Class Availability**:\n     - Given the operating hours of both studios, it is highly likely that they offer evening classes to cater to working professionals.\n     - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street operates until 9:00 PM on weekdays, which strongly suggests that they have classes available between 7-9 pm.\n   - **Class Types**:\n     - AIMS offers a variety of martial arts styles, including Jeet Kune Do, Muay Thai, Kali, and Jiu-Jitsu.\n     - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street specializes in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu but may also offer other related martial arts classes.\n   - **Quality and Suitability**:\n     - Both studios have positive reviews, suggesting they are well-regarded and suitable for professional adults.\n     - The cleanliness and welcoming atmosphere mentioned in reviews indicate a good environment for learning and training.\n   - **Additional Considerations**:\n     - Given the proximity to the New York Stock Exchange, both studios are likely to have a clientele that includes working professionals, which could mean classes are designed to accommodate busy schedules.\n     - The variety of martial arts offered by AIMS might appeal to those interested in a broader range of techniques, while Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street might be more appealing to those specifically interested in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n1. **Verify Walking Distances**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use Google Maps to verify the exact walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to both AIMS and Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street.\n   - **Hint**: Ensure the walking routes are saved for quick reference.\n\n2. **Check AIMS Martial Arts Schedule**:\n   - **Step 2**: Visit the AIMS Martial Arts website (https://aimsmartialarts.com/).\n   - **Step 3**: Navigate to the 'Classes' or 'Schedule' section.\n   - **Step 4**: Scroll through the entire page and look for a detailed class schedule, focusing on evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **Hint**: Use the search function on the website if available to search for specific keywords like \"evening classes\" or \"7-9 pm.\"\n\n3. **Check Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street Schedule**:\n   - **Step 5**: Visit the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website (https://www.renzograciewst.com/).\n   - **Step 6**: Navigate to the 'Schedule' page.\n   - **Step 7**: If the page does not load correctly, refresh the page or try navigating to it again.\n   - **Step 8**: Scroll through the entire page and look for a detailed class schedule, focusing on evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **Hint**: If the schedule is not directly visible, look for a link to download a full schedule or contact information to inquire about evening classes.\n\n4. **Check Reviews and Ratings**:\n   - **Step 9**: Use platforms like Yelp or Google Reviews to check the reviews and ratings of both AIMS Martial Arts and Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street.\n   - **Step 10**: Summarize the key points from the reviews to ensure the quality and suitability of the studios.\n\n5. **Compile and Present Findings**:\n   - **Step 11**: Compile the information gathered, including studio names, addresses, walking distances, class times, and any relevant reviews or ratings.\n   - **Step 12**: Present the findings in a clear and concise manner, highlighting the best options for the user.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Ensure Page Load**: Always verify that the page has fully loaded before proceeding to the next step. Use the `sleep` function if necessary to wait for the page to load completely.\n- **Thorough Navigation**: Explore all sections of the website, including hidden menus and downloadable resources.\n- **Use Search Functions**: Utilize the search function on the website to quickly find specific information.\n- **Multiple Attempts**: If a page does not load correctly, try refreshing or navigating to it again to ensure you have the correct information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues**: The 'Schedule' page on the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website did not load correctly, leading to repeated attempts without success.\n2. **Inefficient Search**: The initial search for class schedules on the AIMS Martial Arts website was not thorough enough, and we did not explore all available sections.\n3. **Lack of Verification**: We did not verify the exact walking distances and class schedules in a systematic manner, leading to incomplete information.\n4. **Redundant Steps**: We repeatedly navigated back to the main Google Maps page instead of completing the required tasks in a single session.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Verify Walking Distances**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use Google Maps to verify the exact walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to both AIMS Martial Arts and Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street.\n   - **Hint**: Ensure the walking routes are saved for quick reference. Use the \"Directions\" feature to get precise walking times.\n\n2. **Check AIMS Martial Arts Schedule**:\n   - **Step 2**: Visit the AIMS Martial Arts website (https://aimsmartialarts.com/).\n   - **Step 3**: Navigate to the 'Classes' or 'Schedule' section.\n   - **Step 4**: Scroll through the entire page and look for a detailed class schedule, focusing on evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **Hint**: Use the search function on the website if available to search for specific keywords like \"evening classes\" or \"7-9 pm.\" If the schedule is not immediately visible, look for a link to download a full schedule or contact information to inquire about evening classes.\n\n3. **Check Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street Schedule**:\n   - **Step 5**: Visit the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website (https://www.renzograciewst.com/).\n   - **Step 6**: Navigate to the 'Schedule' page.\n   - **Step 7**: If the page does not load correctly, refresh the page or try navigating to it again.\n   - **Step 8**: Scroll through the entire page and look for a detailed class schedule, focusing on evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **Hint**: If the schedule is not directly visible, look for a link to download a full schedule or contact information to inquire about evening classes.
