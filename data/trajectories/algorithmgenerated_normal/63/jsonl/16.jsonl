Please solve the problem carefully.The attached file path is: ../2023/validation/8f80e01c-1296-4371-9486-bb3d68651a60.png.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nUsing bass clef notes, determine the age of someone who has experienced the word spelled out in the sheet music by the note letters. The age is calculated as the total number of lines and notes minus the number of notes on lines in the image.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The music theorist will analyze the sheet music and identify the note letters.\n2. The mathematician will calculate the total number of lines and notes, and the number of notes on lines.\n3. The checker will verify the accuracy of the analysis and calculations.\n\n## Output format\n- The word spelled out by the note letters.\n- The total number of lines and notes.\n- The number of notes on lines.\n- The calculated age.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The analysis must be based on the bass clef notes in the provided image.\n- The calculations must be accurate and verified.\n\n## Results from last response\n- The word spelled out by the note letters: Not provided due to the lack of actual note identification.\n- The total number of lines and notes: Hypothetically 12.\n- The number of notes on lines: Hypothetically 4.\n- The calculated age: Hypothetically 8.\n\n## File Path\n../2023/validation/8f80e01c-1296-4371-9486-bb3d68651a60.png\n\n## Errors or issues in the conversation\n1. The OCR process did not produce a valid output, but this issue was not thoroughly investigated or resolved.\n2. The team proceeded with hypothetical calculations instead of getting actual note data, which deviates from the task's requirements of accuracy and verification.\n3. Multiple repetitions of manual note identification instructions without much progression lead to redundancy.\n\n### Need to double-check?\nYes\n\n## Additional information (file path, code blocks, url, etc.)\n- Image file path: ../2023/validation/8f80e01c-1296-4371-9486-bb3d68651a60.png\n- OCR code block used:\n```python\nfrom functions import optical_character_recognition\n\nimage_path = \"../2023/validation/8f80e01c-1296-4371-9486-bb3d68651a60.png\"\nextracted_text = optical_character_recognition(image_path)\nprint(extracted_text)\n```"}

To address this, I will provide a more generic approach using the `Pytesseract` library for OCR, which is a widely-used tool for this purpose.\n\nI'll write a new script that uses `Pytesseract` to extract note letters from the bass clef sheet music image.
