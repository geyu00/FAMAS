It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDb.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) for purchase or rental.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDb ratings of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has several highly acclaimed films, but without looking up the specific ratings and runtimes, it's difficult to guess which one would be the highest-rated and under 2 hours.\n   - Fandango at Home likely has a significant portion of Isabelle Adjani's filmography, but the exact titles and their availability need to be verified.\n   - Based on the initial search, some of Isabelle Adjani's films that are less than 2 hours and have notable ratings include \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979, 1h 47m, 7.4/10) and \"Diabolique\" (1996, 1h 47m, 5.5/10). These films are potential candidates for the highest-rated film that meets the criteria.\n   - \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" is a strong candidate because it has a high IMDb rating and is under 2 hours. We should verify its availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The initial search on IMDb provided a list of Isabelle Adjani's films sorted by runtime. From this list, \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" stands out as a film with a high IMDb rating (7.4/10) and a runtime of 1 hour and 47 minutes.\n- \"Diabolique\" is another film that meets the runtime requirement but has a lower IMDb rating (5.5/10). Therefore, \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" is a more likely candidate for the highest-rated film.\n- Verifying the availability of \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" on Fandango at Home will help confirm if it is the film we are looking for.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure:\n- **Incorrect Search Filters**: The search on IMDb was initially set to only include \"Horror\" genre films, which excluded many of Isabelle Adjani's highly-rated and shorter films.\n- **Sorting Issue**: The search results were sorted by runtime instead of IMDb rating, which did not help in identifying the highest-rated film.\n- **Incomplete Verification**: We did not verify the availability of the films on Fandango at Home, which is a critical part of the criteria.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Correct Search Filters on IMDb**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to IMDb.\n   - Perform a search for Isabelle Adjani's feature films without genre restrictions.\n   - Sort the results by IMDb rating in descending order.\n   - Filter the results to include only films with a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Information**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to extract the titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes of the filtered films.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n   - Search for each film from the filtered list to check its availability for purchase or rental.\n\n4. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to identify the highest-rated film from the filtered list that meets all the criteria (IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n5. **Verify and Report**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to verify the final selection and report the title, IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan:\n- **Step 1: Correct Search Filters on IMDb**\n  - Navigate to IMDb.\n  - Search for \"Isabelle Adjani feature films\".\n  - Remove genre restrictions.\n  - Sort the results by IMDb rating in descending order.\n  - Filter the results to include only films with a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n\n- **Step 2: Extract Relevant Information**\n  - Extract the titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes of the filtered films.\n\n- **Step 3: Check Availability on Fandango at Home**\n  - Navigate to Fandango at Home.\n  - Search for each film from the filtered list.\n  - Check if the film is available for purchase or rental.\n\n- **Step 4: Identify the Highest-Rated Film**\n  - Identify the highest-rated film from the filtered list that meets all the criteria.\n\n- **Step 5: Verify and Report**\n  - Verify the final selection.\n  - Report the title, IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDb.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) for purchase or rental.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDb ratings of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has several highly acclaimed films, but without looking up the specific ratings and runtimes, it's difficult to guess which one would be the highest-rated and under 2 hours.\n   - Fandango at Home likely has a significant portion of Isabelle Adjani's filmography, but the exact titles and their availability need to be verified.\n   - Based on the initial search, some of Isabelle Adjani's films that are less than 2 hours and have notable ratings include \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979, 1h 47m, 7.4/10) and \"Diabolique\" (1996, 1h 47m, 5.5/10). These films are potential candidates for the highest-rated film that meets the criteria.\n   - \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" is a strong candidate because it has a high IMDb rating and is under 2 hours. We should verify its availability on Fandango at Home.\n   - Another potential candidate is \"One Deadly Summer\" (L'été meurtrier, 1983), which has a runtime of 1h 42m and an IMDb rating of 7.3/10. This film is also worth verifying for availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The initial search on IMDb provided a list of Isabelle Adjani's films sorted by runtime. From this list, \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" stands out as a film with a high IMDb rating (7.4/10) and a runtime of 1 hour and 47 minutes.\n- \"Diabolique\" is another film that meets the runtime requirement but has a lower IMDb rating (5.5/10). Therefore, \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" is a more likely candidate for the highest-rated film.\n- \"One Deadly Summer\" (L'été meurtrier) is another film that meets the runtime requirement and has a high IMDb rating (7.3/10). This film is also a strong candidate and should be verified for availability on Fandango at Home.\n- Verifying the availability of both \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" and \"One Deadly Summer\" on Fandango at Home will help confirm if either of these films is the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's Filmography on IMDb:**\n   - Click on 'Filmography' or 'Actress' to view her filmography.\n   - Filter the results to show only 'Feature Films'.\n   - Sort the results by IMDb rating in descending order.\n   - Apply a runtime filter for films less than 2 hours.\n   - Extract the titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes of the filtered films.\n\n2. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home:**\n   - Navigate to Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n   - Search for each film from the filtered list.\n   - Check if the film is available for purchase or rental.\n\n3. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film:**\n   - Identify the highest-rated film from the filtered list that meets all the criteria (IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **Verify and Report:**\n   - Verify the final selection.\n   - Report the title, IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure:\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: We navigated to the biography page instead of the filmography page, which prevented us from filtering and sorting the films as needed.\n- **Lack of Specific Filters**: We did not explicitly apply filters for feature films, IMDb ratings, and runtime on IMDb.\n- **Incomplete Verification**: We did not verify the availability of the films on Fandango at Home.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's Filmography on IMDb:**\n   - Click on 'Filmography' or 'Actress' on Isabelle Adjani's IMDb profile page.\n   - Ensure the filmography is displayed.\n\n2. **Apply Filters and Sort Films:**\n   - Filter the results to show only 'Feature Films'.\n   - Sort the results by IMDb rating in descending order.\n   - Apply a runtime filter for films less than 2 hours.\n   - Extract the titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes of the filtered films.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home:**\n   - Navigate to Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n   - Search for each film from the filtered list.\n   - Check if the film is available for purchase or rental.\n\n4. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film:**\n   - Identify the highest-rated film from the filtered list that meets all the criteria (IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n5. **Verify and Report:**\n   - Verify the final selection.\n   - Report the title, IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan:\n- **Step 1: Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's Filmography on IMDb**\n  - Click on 'Filmography' or 'Actress' on Isabelle Adjani's IMDb profile page.\n  - Ensure the filmography is displayed.\n\n- **Step 2: Apply Filters and Sort Films**\n  - Filter the results to show only 'Feature Films'.\n  - Sort the results by IMDb rating in descending order.\n  - Apply a runtime filter for films less than 2 hours.\n  - Extract the titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes of the filtered films.\n\n- **Step 3: Check Availability on Fandango at Home**\n  - Navigate to Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n  - Search for each film from the filtered list.\n  - Check if the film is available for purchase or rental.\n\n- **Step 4: Identify the Highest-Rated Film**\n  - Identify the highest-rated film from the filtered list that meets all the criteria.\n\n- **Step 5: Verify and Report**\n  - Verify the final selection.\n  - Report the title, IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDb.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) for purchase or rental.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDb ratings of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has several highly acclaimed films, but without looking up the specific ratings and runtimes, it's difficult to guess which one would be the highest-rated and under 2 hours.\n   - Fandango at Home likely has a significant portion of Isabelle Adjani's filmography, but the exact titles and their availability need to be verified.\n   - Based on the initial search, some of Isabelle Adjani's films that are less than 2 hours and have notable ratings include:\n     - \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979, 1h 47m, 7.4/10)\n     - \"Diabolique\" (1996, 1h 47m, 5.5/10)\n     - \"One Deadly Summer\" (L'été meurtrier, 1983, 1h 42m, 7.3/10)\n   - \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" is a strong candidate because it has a high IMDb rating (7.4/10) and is under 2 hours. We should verify its availability on Fandango at Home.\n   - \"One Deadly Summer\" (L'été meurtrier) is another film that meets the runtime requirement and has a high IMDb rating (7.3/10). This film is also a strong candidate and should be verified for availability on Fandango at Home.\n   - \"Diabolique\" is less likely to be the highest-rated film due to its lower IMDb rating (5.5/10).\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The initial search on IMDb provided a list of Isabelle Adjani's films sorted by runtime. From this list, \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" stands out as a film with a high IMDb rating (7.4/10) and a runtime of 1 hour and 47 minutes.\n- \"Diabolique\" is another film that meets the runtime requirement but has a lower IMDb rating (5.5/10). Therefore, \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" is a more likely candidate for the highest-rated film.\n- \"One Deadly Summer\" (L'été meurtrier) is another film that meets the runtime requirement and has a high IMDb rating (7.3/10). This film is also a strong candidate and should be verified for availability on Fandango at Home.\n- Verifying the availability of both \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" and \"One Deadly Summer\" on Fandango at Home will help confirm if either of these films is the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's Filmography on IMDb:**\n   - Click on 'Filmography' or 'Actress' to view her filmography.\n   - Filter the results to show only 'Feature Films'.\n   - Sort the results by IMDb rating in descending order.\n   - Apply a runtime filter for films less than 2 hours.\n   - Extract the titles, IMDb ratings, and runtimes of the filtered films.\n\n2. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home:**\n   - Navigate to Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n   - Search for each film from the filtered list.\n   - Check if the film is available for purchase or rental.\n\n3. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film:**\n   - Identify the highest-rated film from the filtered list that meets all the criteria (IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **Verify and Report:**\n   - Verify the final selection.\n   - Report the title, IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Action:\nClick on the 'Filmography' tab to view Isabelle Adjani's filmography.
