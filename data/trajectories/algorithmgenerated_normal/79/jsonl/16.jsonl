Unfortunately, when I went back about a month later on April 21, it was no longer on the dinner menu.  Using the Wayback Machine, can you help me figure out which main course was on the dinner menu for Virtue on March 22, 2021 but not April 21, 2021? Answer using the singular form, without articles. Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nRetrieve the dinner menus for Virtue restaurant & bar in Chicago on March 22, 2021, and April 21, 2021, using the Wayback Machine. Compare the two menus to identify the main course that was present on March 22, 2021, but not on April 21, 2021.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Access the Wayback Machine to retrieve the archived dinner menu for Virtue restaurant & bar on March 22, 2021.\n2. Access the Wayback Machine to retrieve the archived dinner menu for Virtue restaurant & bar on April 21, 2021.\n3. Compare the two menus to identify the main course that was present on March 22, 2021, but not on April 21, 2021.\n4. Provide the name of the main course in singular form, without articles.\n\n## Output format\n- The name of the main course in singular form, without articles.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The main course must be identified accurately by comparing the two menus.\n- The output must be in singular form and without articles."}

Let's start with that.\n\nI will use the Wayback Machine API to find the snapshots for Virtue restaurant & bar around that date. \n\nHere’s the plan:\n1. Check for the archived URLs of the Virtue restaurant & bar menu on March 22, 2021.\n2. Then, I'll check for the archived URLs of the menu on April 21, 2021. \n\nLet's proceed with retrieving the March 22, 2021 menu. \n\nI'll look for the URL pattern that likely holds their menu. I will assume it is something like `https://www.virtuerestaurant.com/menu`.\n\nNow, let me retrieve the snapshot from the Wayback Machine. \n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Define the URL for the restaurant menu\nurl = \"https://www.virtuerestaurant.com/menu\"\n\n# Getting the snapshot dates for the desired times\nresponse_march = requests.get(f\"http://archive.org/wayback/available?url={url}&timestamp=20210322\")\nresponse_april = requests.get(f\"http://archive.org/wayback/available?url={url}&timestamp=20210421\")\n\n# Fetching snapshots\nmarch_snapshot = response_march.json().get('archived_snapshots', {}).get('closest', {}).get('url', '')\napril_snapshot = response_april.json().get('archived_snapshots', {}).get('closest', {}).get('url', '')\n\n(march_snapshot, april_snapshot)\n```\n\nNow, I will execute this code to retrieve the URLs for the snapshots.
