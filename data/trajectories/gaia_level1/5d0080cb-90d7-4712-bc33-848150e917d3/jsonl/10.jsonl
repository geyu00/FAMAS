It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request mentions a specific paper: \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet\" by the University of Leicester.\n   - The specific information requested is the volume in m³ of the fish bag.\n   - The paper was published in 2017 as part of the *Journal of Interdisciplinary Science Topics* (Volume 6).\n   - The author of the paper is Amal Doua from the Centre for Interdisciplinary Science, University of Leicester.\n   - The paper states that Toothless would require 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, totaling 716 kg over the twelve days he was trapped.\n   - Hiccup would have had to carry 828 fish weighing a total of 8592 kg over the twelve days, which is considered unrealistic.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact volume in m³ of the fish bag as reported in the University of Leicester paper \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet.\"\n   - Any relevant dimensions or calculations of the fish bag that could help derive the volume if it is not directly stated.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - If the volume is not directly stated in the paper, we will need to derive it from other given data, such as the dimensions of the fish bag or the number and size of fish it contains.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The volume of the fish bag is likely to be a small to medium-sized volume, considering the context of the fictional world of \"How to Train Your Dragon\" and the practicality of carrying fish for a dragon.\n   - Given that Hiccup would need to carry a significant amount of fish, the fish bag might be designed to hold a substantial volume, possibly around 0.5 to 1 m³, to make the task more feasible.\n   - The paper is part of a series of fun, physics-based papers published by the University of Leicester, which often explore scientific concepts through pop culture references. Therefore, the calculations and details provided are likely to be simplified and presented in an engaging manner.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The volume of 0.5 to 1 m³ is a reasonable estimate based on the need to carry a large number of fish over multiple days. This volume would allow Hiccup to transport a significant amount of fish in a single trip, making the task more feasible, even though it is still described as unrealistic in the paper.\n- The context of the paper being part of a series of fun, physics-based papers suggests that the calculations are meant to be accessible and engaging, rather than highly precise. Therefore, the volume of the fish bag, if not directly stated, is likely to be a simple and practical estimate.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Incomplete Scrolling and Searching:** The previous attempts involved scrolling through the page but did not systematically cover the entire document, leading to potential missed information.\n- **Lack of Direct Search for Volume:** There was no explicit search for the term \"volume\" or \"m³\" within the document, which could have helped in finding the relevant information more efficiently.\n- **Insufficient Use of Metadata and PDF Download:** The metadata and the option to download the PDF were not fully utilized, which could have provided additional context or direct access to the full text.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Systematic Scrolling and Searching:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Scroll to the top of the page and systematically scroll through the entire document, searching for any mention of the volume in m³ of the fish bag.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F or Cmd + F) to search for keywords like \"volume,\" \"m³,\" \"fish bag,\" and \"dimensions.\"\n\n- **Utilize Metadata and PDF:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Check the metadata for any additional details about the volume or dimensions of the fish bag.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Download the PDF version of the paper from the provided link and save it locally.\n  - **FileSurfer:** Open the downloaded PDF and search for the same keywords to ensure no information is missed.\n\n- **Summarize and Verify:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Summarize the relevant sections of the paper that discuss the fish bag and its volume.\n  - **Assistant:** Verify the findings and provide the final answer to the original request.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - Scroll to the top of the page.\n  - Systematically scroll through the entire document, searching for any mention of the volume in m³ of the fish bag.\n  - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F or Cmd + F) to search for keywords like \"volume,\" \"m³,\" \"fish bag,\" and \"dimensions.\"\n  - Check the metadata for any additional details about the volume or dimensions of the fish bag.\n  - Click on the PDF download link and save the file locally.\n\n- **FileSurfer:**\n  - Open the downloaded PDF and search for the same keywords to ensure no information is missed.\n\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - Summarize the relevant sections of the paper that discuss the fish bag and its volume.\n\n- **Assistant:**\n  - Verify the findings and provide the final answer to the original request."}

In the 2010 film, Toothless is struck\ndown  during  a  dragon  raid  and  loses  his  left  tail-fin,  leaving  him  trapped  in  a  sunken  area.  This  paper\ninvestigates  the  feasibility  of  Hiccup,  a  teenage  boy,  being  able  to  supply  enough  fish  to  maintain  the\ndragon’s diet by catching and bringing fish to him. It was found that in the twelve days that Toothless was\ntrapped, he would have required 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, which totalled 716 kg.\nHiccup  would  have  had  to  carry  828  fish  weighing  at  total  of  8592  kg  over  the  twelve  days,  which  is\nunrealistic since he struggles to lift a shield in combat.\n\nIntroduction\nThe  How  to  Train  Your  Dragon  franchise  is  loosely\nbased on the popular book series by Cressida Cowell\n[1]. The events take  place in  Viking  Scotland, in the\nsmall village of Berk which is repeatedly attacked by\ndragons. One of the  deadliest  dragon  species  is the\nNight Fury, which was previously unseen by any living\nperson.  It  is  described  as  the  “unholy  offspring  of\nlightning  and  death  itself”  due  to  its  speed  and\ncamouflage abilities [2]. Toothless is the only known\nNight Fury, and is shown to be intelligent and playful\nwhile also deadly.\n\nHiccup Horrendous Haddock III, the main protagonist,\nis  a  small  teenage  boy  eager  to  prove  himself  as  a\nViking. Using an invention which closely resembles a\nnet  gun,  Hiccup  strikes  down  Toothless  during  a\ndragon  raid.  Toothless’  left  caudal  fin  is  severed,\nrendering him unable to fly out of the sunken area,\nknown as The Cove [3]. Fish are a large component of\nis  exclusively\na  dragon’s  diet,  and  Toothless\ndependent  on  fish  for  nutrition  [4].  This  paper\ninvestigates  whether  Hiccup  is  able  to  maintain\nToothless’ feeding habits while he is trapped in The\nCove.\n\nAssumptions\nSeveral  assumptions  and  simplifications  must  be\nmade  to  calculate  the  required  values.  During  the\ntime  lapse  montages  in  the  film,  it  is  taken  that\n\nToothless is in The Cove for a total of twelve days [5].\nIt is assumed that Hiccup visited once a day for the\nduration of Toothless’ stay.\n\nOn  the  third  day,  Hiccup  brings  a  sack  of  fish,  and\nmentions that it contains Icelandic cod and salmon.\nThere  is  also  a  pond  in  the  clearing,  and  one  scene\nshows  Toothless  hunting  for  fish.  However,  in  this\npaper,  it  is  assumed  that  Toothless  relies  solely  on\nHiccup for nutrition. During his time in The Cove, it is\nassumed  that  his  diet  consists  of  only  salmon  and\ncod. It is also assumed that each sack contained the\nsame amount of fish, and that he received the same\namount every day for twelve days.\n\nThe sack is modelled as a cylinder, while the fish have\nbeen modelled as prolate spheroids (see Appendix for\nvisual aids).\n\nFigure 1 – Comparison of size of Hiccup to bag [5].\n\nSize of the bag\nHiccup is said to be 1.625 m tall [6], and using average\nmale  proportions,  the  bag  appears  to  be  3/8  of  his\nheight [7]. Therefore, the height of the bag,\n\n:\n\n𝐻𝐻𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏\n\n\fCan Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?
