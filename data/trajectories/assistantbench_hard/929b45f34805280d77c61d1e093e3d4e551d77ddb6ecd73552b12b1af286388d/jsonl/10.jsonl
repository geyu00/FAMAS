What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The dog genome has been updated several times since 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the most relevant files as of May 2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The exact location (URL) where these files can be accessed.\n   - The repository or database where the dog genome files are stored (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None identified at this stage.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files in May 2020 are likely to be part of a recent update to the dog genome, possibly from a major genomics project like the Canine Genome Project.\n   - The files are likely hosted on a reputable scientific database such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the most relevant version of the dog genome as of May 2020:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for the most recent update to the dog genome around May 2020.\n  - Focus the search on reputable scientific databases like NCBI, Ensembl, or the Canine Genome Project website.\n\n- **Locate the specific files:**\n  - Once the relevant version is identified, use WebSurfer to navigate to the specific page or section where the genome files are hosted.\n  - Verify the URL and ensure it points to the correct version of the genome.\n\n- **Extract the URL:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to copy the direct link to the files.\n  - Ensure the link is accessible and points to the correct data.\n\n- **Verify the information:**\n  - Double-check the version and date to ensure it matches the context of May 2020.\n  - If necessary, use WebSurfer to cross-reference with other sources to confirm the accuracy.\n\n- **Provide the final answer:**\n  - Present the verified URL and any additional relevant details about the genome files."}

Humans and dogs also share orthologous genes, genomic architecture and disease sets, placing the dog as an important comparative species for human genetics and genomics. Taking advantage of pet dog medical records, within breed homogeneity and disease risk enrichment, it has been possible to provide insights into both rare and common spontaneous disease. The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals website (OMIA, June 2020, omia.org) currently catalogues 774 canine traits with linked genetic associations, 234 of which are likely causative in the canine models for human disease. The types of canine variants implicated in disease range from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (e.g. a missense variation in \nSections\nFigures\nReferences\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nResults and discussion\nMethods\nData availability\nCode availability\nReferences\nAcknowledgements\nFunding\nAuthor information\nEthics declarations\nAdditional information\nSupplementary information\nRights and permissions\nAbout this article\nThis article is cited by\nAdvertisement\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Humans and dogs also share orthologous genes, genomic architecture and disease sets, placing the dog as an important comparative species for human genetics and genomics. Taking advantage of pet dog medical records, within breed homogeneity and disease risk enrichment, it has been possible to provide insights into both rare and common spontaneous disease. The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals website (OMIA, June 2020, omia.org) currently catalogues 774 canine traits with linked genetic associations, 234 of which are likely causative in the canine models for human disease. The types of canine variants implicated in disease range from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (e.g. a missense variation in \nSOD1 leading to degenerative myelopathy\n5) through complex genomic rearrangements (e.g. a deletion in the repetitive interferon alpha gene cluster associated with hypothyroidism\n6), and were identified with canine SNP chips, e.g., CanineHD BeadChip (Illumina), genotyping complemented with imputation\n7 or genome and transcriptome sequencing of individuals, families\n8 or large populations\n3. Clearly, genome contiguity as well as gene and regulatory element annotation from a range of diverse breeds and tissues are all required to translate association to causation.\nThe current canine reference genome, CanFam3.1, is based on a 2005 7.4× Sanger sequencing framework\n9, improved in 2014 with multiple methods to better resolve euchromatic regions and annotate transcripts from gross tissues\n10. However, it still contains 23,876 gaps, with 19.6% of these within gene bodies, and a further 9.8% located a mere 5 kb upstream of predicted gene start sites. These gaps result from the accumulation of regions that are difficult to sequence, and are in part due to the loss of \nPRDM9 which leads to genomic sections with very high GC content\n11. The consequence of this is the loss of promoters, CpG islands and other regulatory elements from the reference; sequences which may hold the key to deciphering complex traits\n12,13.\nTo drive canine comparative genomics forward, we generated a high-quality canine reference assembly using a combination of Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long read sequencing, 10x Genomics Chromium Linked Reads (henceforth called 10x) and HiC proximity ligation. The new reference, UU_CFam_GSD_1.0/canFam4 (henceforth called GSD_1.0), was subsequently annotated with both novel and published whole-genome sequencing (WGS), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) and RNA sequencing to enhance gene models and variant annotation. A liftover of gap regions from CanFam3.1 showed 23,251/23,836 elements contain uniquely anchored sequences in GSD_1.0, and annotation of the new reference resulted in 159 thousand transcripts across 29,583 genes.

Mischka was free of known genetic disorders, and when compared with additional German Shepherd sourced from within Sweden, was found to be genetically representative of the breed (Supplementary Fig. \n1). We sequenced the genome using ~100× coverage PacBio long reads and assembled these in contigs with the standard FALCON method\n14. Further scaffolding using 94× of 10x and 48× of HiC linked reads resulted in 39 single-scaffold chromosomes (total 2.35 Gb) and 2159 unplaced scaffolds (total 128.5 Mb; Fig. \n1a).

What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information we have gathered:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The dog genome has been updated several times since 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the most relevant files as of May 2020.\n   - The most recent and relevant version of the dog genome as of May 2020 is GSD_1.0 (also known as canFam4).\n   - GSD_1.0 was published in February 2021 and represents a significant improvement over the previous version, CanFam3.1, with 55-fold increased contiguity and a reduction in gaps from 23,836 to 585.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact location (URL) where the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files can be accessed.\n   - The repository or database where the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files are stored (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None identified at this stage.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files are likely hosted on a reputable scientific database such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).\n   - Given the significance of the GSD_1.0/canFam4 update, it is highly probable that the files are available on the NCBI's GenBank or the Ensembl database.\n   - The supplementary materials or data availability section of the published paper in Communications Biology should provide a direct link to the genome files.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome is a major update and is likely to be widely distributed and accessible through major genomics databases.\n- The supplementary materials or data availability section of the published paper often includes direct links to the datasets, making it a reliable source for finding the specific URL.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Navigate to the 'Data availability' section of the published paper in Communications Biology to find the specific URL for downloading the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files.\n- Check the NCBI and Ensembl databases for the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Navigation**: The web browser was not navigated efficiently to locate the 'Data availability' section or the supplementary materials, which are likely to contain the direct links to the genome files.\n2. **Lack of Specific Search**: The search for the specific URL was not focused enough, leading to repeated scrolling without finding the relevant section.\n3. **Missed Opportunities**: The metadata and visible text did not indicate the presence of a 'Data availability' section, which could have been more clearly identified earlier.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to the 'Data Availability' Section**:\n   - Scroll down the page to find the 'Data availability' section.\n   - If the 'Data availability' section is not immediately visible, use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to search for keywords like \"data availability,\" \"supplementary materials,\" \"download,\" or \"files.\"\n\n2. **Check for Supplementary Materials**:\n   - Look for links to supplementary materials or additional resources that might contain the genome files.\n   - Click on any links to supplementary materials and check the content for download links.\n\n3. **Verify the URL**:\n   - Once the relevant section is found, extract the direct link to the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files.\n   - Ensure the link is accessible and points to the correct data.\n\n4. **Cross-Reference with NCBI and Ensembl**:\n   - If the link is not found on the Communications Biology page, search for GSD_1.0/canFam4 on the NCBI and Ensembl databases.\n   - Use the search function on these databases to find the specific genome files.\n\n5. **Summarize and Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Present the verified URL and any additional relevant details about the genome files.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Scroll down the page to find the 'Data availability' section.\n- **Step 2**: Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to search for keywords like \"data availability,\" \"supplementary materials,\" \"download,\" or \"files.\"\n- **Step 3**: Click on any links to supplementary materials and check the content for download links.\n- **Step 4**: Extract the direct link to the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files and verify its accessibility.\n- **Step 5**: If the link is not found, search for GSD_1.0/canFam4 on the NCBI and Ensembl databases.\n- **Step 6**: Summarize and provide the final answer with the verified URL and relevant details.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Hint 1**: Use the browser's search function to quickly locate the 'Data availability' section.\n- **Hint 2**: Look for specific keywords related to data and file downloads.\n- **Hint 3**: If the link is not immediately visible, check for any external links or references to other databases.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan."}

Annotation with generated and existing long and short read RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and ATAC-seq, revealed that 32.1% of lifted over CanFam3.1 gaps harboured previously hidden functional elements, including promoters, genes and miRNAs in GSD_1.0. A catalogue of canine “dark” regions was made to facilitate mapping rescue. Alignment in these regions is difficult, but we demonstrate that they harbour trait-associated variation. Key genomic regions were completed, including the Dog Leucocyte Antigen (DLA), T Cell Receptor (TCR) and 366 COSMIC cancer genes. 10x linked-read sequencing of 27 dogs (19 breeds) uncovered 22.1 million SNPs, indels and larger structural variants.

Humans and dogs also share orthologous genes, genomic architecture and disease sets, placing the dog as an important comparative species for human genetics and genomics. Taking advantage of pet dog medical records, within breed homogeneity and disease risk enrichment, it has been possible to provide insights into both rare and common spontaneous disease. The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals website (OMIA, June 2020, omia.org) currently catalogues 774 canine traits with linked genetic associations, 234 of which are likely causative in the canine models for human disease. The types of canine variants implicated in disease range from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (e.g. a missense variation in \nSOD1 leading to degenerative myelopathy\n5) through complex genomic rearrangements (e.g. a deletion in the repetitive interferon alpha gene cluster associated with hypothyroidism\n6), and were identified with canine SNP chips, e.g., CanineHD BeadChip (Illumina), genotyping complemented with imputation\n7 or genome and transcriptome sequencing of individuals, families\n8 or large populations\n3. Clearly, genome contiguity as well as gene and regulatory element annotation from a range of diverse breeds and tissues are all required to translate association to causation.\nThe current canine reference genome, CanFam3.1, is based on a 2005 7.4× Sanger sequencing framework\n9, improved in 2014 with multiple methods to better resolve euchromatic regions and annotate transcripts from gross tissues\n10. However, it still contains 23,876 gaps, with 19.6% of these within gene bodies, and a further 9.8% located a mere 5 kb upstream of predicted gene start sites. These gaps result from the accumulation of regions that are difficult to sequence, and are in part due to the loss of \nPRDM9 which leads to genomic sections with very high GC content\n11. The consequence of this is the loss of promoters, CpG islands and other regulatory elements from the reference; sequences which may hold the key to deciphering complex traits\n12,13.\nTo drive canine comparative genomics forward, we generated a high-quality canine reference assembly using a combination of Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long read sequencing, 10x Genomics Chromium Linked Reads (henceforth called 10x) and HiC proximity ligation. The new reference, UU_CFam_GSD_1.0/canFam4 (henceforth called GSD_1.0), was subsequently annotated with both novel and published whole-genome sequencing (WGS), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) and RNA sequencing to enhance gene models and variant annotation. A liftover of gap regions from CanFam3.1 showed 23,251/23,836 elements contain uniquely anchored sequences in GSD_1.0, and annotation of the new reference resulted in 159 thousand transcripts across 29,583 genes. This novel data open the door to the identification of functional variants underlying complex traits, especially in difficult to sequence, and often biologically important regions.\nSections\nFigures\nReferences\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nResults and discussion\nMethods\nData availability\nCode availability\nReferences\nAcknowledgements\nFunding\nAuthor information\nEthics declarations\nAdditional information\nSupplementary information\nRights and permissions\nAbout this article\nThis article is cited by\nAdvertisement\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The new reference, UU_CFam_GSD_1.0/canFam4 (henceforth called GSD_1.0), was subsequently annotated with both novel and published whole-genome sequencing (WGS), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) and RNA sequencing to enhance gene models and variant annotation. A liftover of gap regions from CanFam3.1 showed 23,251/23,836 elements contain uniquely anchored sequences in GSD_1.0, and annotation of the new reference resulted in 159 thousand transcripts across 29,583 genes. This novel data open the door to the identification of functional variants underlying complex traits, especially in difficult to sequence, and often biologically important regions.\nResults and discussion\nDe novo assembly\nMischka, a 12-year-old female German Shepherd, was selected as the source for our high-quality reference genome assembly. Mischka was free of known genetic disorders, and when compared with additional German Shepherd sourced from within Sweden, was found to be genetically representative of the breed (Supplementary Fig. \n1). We sequenced the genome using ~100× coverage PacBio long reads and assembled these in contigs with the standard FALCON method\n14. Further scaffolding using 94× of 10x and 48× of HiC linked reads resulted in 39 single-scaffold chromosomes (total 2.35 Gb) and 2159 unplaced scaffolds (total 128.5 Mb; Fig. \n1a). The latter contigs predominantly contain segmental duplications (58.1%) and centromeric repeats (30.1%; Supplementary Fig. \n2).\nFig. 1: Features of the novel canine assembly.\nSections\nFigures\nReferences\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nResults and discussion\nMethods\nData availability\nCode availability\nReferences\nAcknowledgements\nFunding\nAuthor information\nEthics declarations\nAdditional information\nSupplementary information\nRights and permissions\nAbout this article\nThis article is cited by\nAdvertisement\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The identified sequence with extreme GC content (>90% in 50 bp windows) increased from 0.8 to 1.7 Mb (Fig. \n1b), leading to a 14% increase in the average length of CpG islands (1056 vs 926 bp, \nP = 8.4 × 10\n−4, \nt-test). Meanwhile, we examined the CanFam3.1 gaps that could be considered closed (23,251/23,836 gap elements from CanFam3.1 have sequence in GSD_1.0; see “Methods”), and found that these regions have either high GC or high repeat content (Fig. \n1c).\nTable 1 Assembly statistics of GSD_1.0 compared to CanFam3.1.Full size table\nRepeat structure\nApproximately 42.7% of the genome is repetitive sequence, with the three major categories being LINEs (504 Mb), SINEs (253 Mb) and LTRs (120 Mb) (Supplementary Fig. \n4 and Supplementary Table \n1). Long read technology allowed for the further resolution of centromeric repeats, and based on their positions, the orientation of chr 27 and 32 were reversed compared to CanFam3.1. These two chromosomal re-orientations were further supported by published recombination rate patterns and fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments\n15. In addition, the q-arms of 21 autosomes now begin with centromeric repeats, and 17 autosomes end in telomeric repeats (Fig. \n1a). As expected, the sub-metacentric chr X has telomeric repeats at each end, and a clear centromeric signal at 49.4–49.9 Mb. Throughout the genome we found 10 internal centromeric and 7 internal telomeric repeats. These may indicate ancient centromere and telomere positions prior to chromosomal rearrangements and most were also present in the previous reference genome assembly.\nSections\nFigures\nReferences\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nResults and discussion\nMethods\nData availability\nCode availability\nReferences\nAcknowledgements\nFunding\nAuthor information\nEthics declarations\nAdditional information\nSupplementary information\nRights and permissions\nAbout this article\nThis article is cited by\nAdvertisement\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information we have gathered:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The dog genome has been updated several times since 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the most relevant files as of May 2020.\n   - The most recent and relevant version of the dog genome as of May 2020 is GSD_1.0 (also known as canFam4).\n   - GSD_1.0 was published in February 2021 and represents a significant improvement over the previous version, CanFam3.1, with 55-fold increased contiguity and a reduction in gaps from 23,836 to 585.\n   - The GSD_1.0 genome was generated using a combination of Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long read sequencing, 10x Genomics Chromium Linked Reads, and HiC proximity ligation.\n\n#### 2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact location (URL) where the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files can be accessed.\n   - The repository or database where the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files are stored (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl).\n\n#### 3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None identified at this stage.\n\n#### 4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files are likely hosted on a reputable scientific database such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).\n   - Given the significance of the GSD_1.0/canFam4 update, it is highly probable that the files are available on the NCBI's GenBank or the Ensembl database.\n   - The supplementary materials or data availability section of the published paper in Communications Biology should provide a direct link to the genome files.\n   - The data availability section of the paper mentions that the genome assembly is available in the NCBI Assembly database under the accession number GCA_011100685.1.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome is a major update and is likely to be widely distributed and accessible through major genomics databases.\n- The supplementary materials or data availability section of the published paper often includes direct links to the datasets, making it a reliable source for finding the specific URL.\n- The mention of the NCBI Assembly database in the data availability section strongly suggests that the files are hosted there.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Navigate to the 'Data availability' section of the published paper in Communications Biology to find the specific URL for downloading the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files.\n- Check the NCBI Assembly database using the accession number GCA_011100685.1 to confirm the availability of the genome files.\n- If the link is not found, search for GSD_1.0/canFam4 on the NCBI and Ensembl databases.\n\n### Hints\n- **Hint 1**: Use the browser's search function to quickly locate the 'Data availability' section.\n- **Hint 2**: Look for specific keywords related to data and file downloads.\n- **Hint 3**: If the link is not immediately visible, check for any external links or references to other databases.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to find the specific URL for the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Navigation**: The web browser was not navigated efficiently to locate the 'Data availability' section or the supplementary materials, which are likely to contain the direct links to the genome files.\n2. **Lack of Specific Search**: The search for the specific URL was not focused enough, leading to repeated scrolling without finding the relevant section.\n3. **Missed Opportunities**: The metadata and visible text did not indicate the presence of a 'Data availability' section, which could have been more clearly identified earlier.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to the 'Data Availability' Section**:\n   - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to search for keywords like \"data availability,\" \"supplementary materials,\" \"download,\" or \"files.\"\n   - If the 'Data availability' section is not immediately visible, scroll down the page systematically to ensure thorough coverage.\n\n2. **Check for Supplementary Materials**:\n   - Look for links to supplementary materials or additional resources that might contain the genome files.\n   - Click on any links to supplementary materials and check the content for download links.\n\n3. **Verify the URL**:\n   - Once the relevant section is found, extract the direct link to the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files.\n   - Ensure the link is accessible and points to the correct data.\n\n4. **Cross-Reference with NCBI and Ensembl**:\n   - If the link is not found on the Communications Biology page, search for GSD_1.0/canFam4 on the NCBI and Ensembl databases.\n   - Use the search function on these databases to find the specific genome files.\n\n5. **Summarize and Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Present the verified URL and any additional relevant details about the genome files.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to search for keywords like \"data availability,\" \"supplementary materials,\" \"download,\" or \"files.\"\n- **Step 2**: If the 'Data availability' section is not immediately visible, scroll down the page systematically to ensure thorough coverage.\n- **Step 3**: Look for links to supplementary materials or additional resources that might contain the genome files.\n- **Step 4**: Click on any links to supplementary materials and check the content for download links.\n- **Step 5**: Extract the direct link to the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files and verify its accessibility.\n- **Step 6**: If the link is not found, search for GSD_1.0/canFam4 on the NCBI and Ensembl databases.\n- **Step 7**: Summarize and provide the final answer with the verified URL and relevant details.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Hint 1**: Use the browser's search function to quickly locate the 'Data availability' section.\n- **Hint 2**: Look for specific keywords related to data and file downloads.\n- **Hint 3**: If the link is not immediately visible, check for any external links or references to other databases.\n- **Hint 4**: Use the NCBI Assembly database and the accession number GCA_011100685.1 to confirm the availability of the genome files.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. First, use the browser's search function to find the 'Data availability' section."}

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and the progress we've made:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The dog genome has been updated several times since 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the most relevant files as of May 2020.\n   - The most recent and relevant version of the dog genome as of May 2020 is GSD_1.0 (also known as canFam4).\n   - GSD_1.0 was published in February 2021 and represents a significant improvement over the previous version, CanFam3.1, with 55-fold increased contiguity and a reduction in gaps from 23,836 to 585.\n   - The GSD_1.0 genome was generated using a combination of Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long read sequencing, 10x Genomics Chromium Linked Reads, and HiC proximity ligation.\n   - The genome assembly is available in the NCBI Assembly database under the accession number GCA_011100685.1.\n\n#### 2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact location (URL) where the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files can be accessed.\n   - The repository or database where the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files are stored (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl).\n\n#### 3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None identified at this stage.\n\n#### 4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files are likely hosted on a reputable scientific database such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).\n   - Given the significance of the GSD_1.0/canFam4 update, it is highly probable that the files are available on the NCBI's GenBank or the Ensembl database.\n   - The supplementary materials or data availability section of the published paper in Communications Biology should provide a direct link to the genome files.\n   - The data availability section of the paper mentions that the genome assembly is available in the NCBI Assembly database under the accession number GCA_011100685.1.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome is a major update and is likely to be widely distributed and accessible through major genomics databases.\n- The supplementary materials or data availability section of the published paper often includes direct links to the datasets, making it a reliable source for finding the specific URL.\n- The mention of the NCBI Assembly database in the data availability section strongly suggests that the files are hosted there.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the NCBI Assembly Database:**\n   - Go to the NCBI Assembly database and search for the accession number GCA_011100685.1.\n   - Verify the availability of the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files and extract the direct link.\n\n2. **Check the Ensembl Database:**\n   - If the files are not found on NCBI, search for GSD_1.0/canFam4 on the Ensembl database.\n   - Look for the genome files and extract the direct link.\n\n3. **Summarize and Provide the Final Answer:**\n   - Present the verified URL and any additional relevant details about the genome files.\n\n### Hints\n- **Hint 1**: Use the browser's search function to quickly locate the 'Data availability' section.\n- **Hint 2**: Look for specific keywords related to data and file downloads.\n- **Hint 3**: If the link is not immediately visible, check for any external links or references to other databases.\n- **Hint 4**: Use the NCBI Assembly database and the accession number GCA_011100685.1 to confirm the availability of the genome files.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to find the specific URL for the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files.\n\n### Action\nPlease navigate to the NCBI Assembly database and search for the accession number GCA_011100685.1. Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to look for keywords like 'data availability,' 'supplementary materials,' 'download,' or 'files.' If the 'Data availability' section is not immediately visible, scroll down the page systematically to ensure thorough coverage. Look for links to supplementary materials or additional resources that might contain the genome files.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: We navigated to the UCSC Genome Browser and selected the human genome instead of the dog genome (GSD_1.0/canFam4).\n2. **Lack of Specific Search**: The search for the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files was not focused enough, leading to incorrect navigation.\n3. **Missed Opportunities**: We missed the opportunity to directly search for the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files on the NCBI Assembly database using the accession number GCA_011100685.1.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to NCBI Assembly Database**:\n   - Open the NCBI Assembly database in the web browser.\n   - Search for the accession number GCA_011100685.1.\n\n2. **Locate the Data Availability Section**:\n   - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to look for keywords like 'data availability,' 'supplementary materials,' 'download,' or 'files.'\n   - If the 'Data availability' section is not immediately visible, scroll down the page systematically to ensure thorough coverage.\n\n3. **Extract the Direct Link**:\n   - Identify and extract the direct link to the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files.\n   - Verify the link by checking if it leads to the correct data.\n\n4. **Summarize and Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Present the verified URL and any additional relevant details about the genome files.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Hint 1**: Use the browser's search function to quickly locate the 'Data availability' section.\n- **Hint 2**: Look for specific keywords related to data and file downloads.\n- **Hint 3**: If the link is not immediately visible, check for any external links or references to other databases.\n- **Hint 4**: Use the NCBI Assembly database and the accession number GCA_011100685.1 to confirm the availability of the genome files.\n\n### Action\n\nPlease navigate to the NCBI Assembly database and search for the accession number GCA_011100685.1. Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to look for keywords like 'data availability,' 'supplementary materials,' 'download,' or 'files.'

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The dog genome has been updated several times since 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the most relevant files as of May 2020.\n   - The most recent and relevant version of the dog genome as of May 2020 is GSD_1.0 (also known as canFam4).\n   - GSD_1.0 was published in February 2021 and represents a significant improvement over the previous version, CanFam3.1, with 55-fold increased contiguity and a reduction in gaps from 23,836 to 585.\n   - The GSD_1.0 genome was generated using a combination of Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long read sequencing, 10x Genomics Chromium Linked Reads, and HiC proximity ligation.\n   - The genome assembly is available in the NCBI Assembly database under the accession number GCA_011100685.1.\n   - Access to the NCBI website was temporarily blocked due to a possible misuse/abuse situation involving the IP address 43.154.234.176.\n\n#### 2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact location (URL) where the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files can be accessed.\n   - The repository or database where the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files are stored (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl).\n\n#### 3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None identified at this stage.\n\n#### 4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files are likely hosted on a reputable scientific database such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).\n   - Given the significance of the GSD_1.0/canFam4 update, it is highly probable that the files are available on the NCBI's GenBank or the Ensembl database.\n   - The supplementary materials or data availability section of the published paper in Communications Biology should provide a direct link to the genome files.\n   - The data availability section of the paper mentions that the genome assembly is available in the NCBI Assembly database under the accession number GCA_011100685.1.\n   - Since access to the NCBI website is currently blocked, we should try accessing the genome files through alternative databases or mirrors, such as Ensembl or the UCSC Genome Browser.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome is a major update and is likely to be widely distributed and accessible through major genomics databases.\n- The supplementary materials or data availability section of the published paper often includes direct links to the datasets, making it a reliable source for finding the specific URL.\n- The mention of the NCBI Assembly database in the data availability section strongly suggests that the files are hosted there, but given the current block, we need to explore alternative sources.\n- Ensembl and the UCSC Genome Browser are reputable alternatives that often mirror important genomic data.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the Ensembl Database:**\n   - Go to the Ensembl database and search for the dog genome (canFam4 or GSD_1.0).\n   - Verify the availability of the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files and extract the direct link.\n\n2. **Check the UCSC Genome Browser:**\n   - If the files are not found on Ensembl, search for GSD_1.0/canFam4 on the UCSC Genome Browser.\n   - Look for the genome files and extract the direct link.\n\n3. **Summarize and Provide the Final Answer:**\n   - Present the verified URL and any additional relevant details about the genome files.\n\n### Hints\n- **Hint 1**: Use the browser's search function to quickly locate the 'Data availability' section.\n- **Hint 2**: Look for specific keywords related to data and file downloads.\n- **Hint 3**: If the link is not immediately visible, check for any external links or references to other databases.\n- **Hint 4**: Use the Ensembl database and the UCSC Genome Browser to confirm the availability of the genome files.\n\n### Action\nPlease navigate to the Ensembl database and search for the dog genome (canFam4 or GSD_1.0). Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to look for keywords like 'data availability,' 'supplementary materials,' 'download,' or 'files.' If the 'Data availability' section is not immediately visible, scroll down the page systematically to ensure thorough coverage. Look for links to supplementary materials or additional resources that might contain the genome files.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Access Blockage**: The attempt to access the NCBI Assembly database was blocked due to a possible misuse/abuse situation involving the IP address 43.154.234.176.\n2. **Single Point of Failure**: Relying solely on the NCBI Assembly database without considering alternative sources led to a dead end when access was blocked.\n3. **Lack of Redundancy**: No backup plan was in place to access the genome files from other reputable databases like Ensembl or the UCSC Genome Browser.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Ensembl Database**:\n   - Open the Ensembl database in the web browser.\n   - Search for the dog genome (canFam4 or GSD_1.0).\n   - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to look for keywords like 'data availability,' 'supplementary materials,' 'download,' or 'files.'\n   - Scroll down the page systematically to ensure thorough coverage.\n   - Extract the direct link to the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files.\n\n2. **Navigate to UCSC Genome Browser**:\n   - If the files are not found on Ensembl, open the UCSC Genome Browser in the web browser.\n   - Search for the dog genome (canFam4 or GSD_1.0).\n   - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to look for keywords like 'data availability,' 'supplementary materials,' 'download,' or 'files.'\n   - Scroll down the page systematically to ensure thorough coverage.\n   - Extract the direct link to the GSD_1.0/canFam4 genome files.\n\n3. **Verify the Link**:\n   - Click on the extracted link to verify that it leads to the correct genome files.\n   - Ensure the files are the most relevant as of May 2020.\n\n4. **Summarize and Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Present the verified URL and any additional relevant details about the genome files.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Hint 1**: Use the browser's search function to quickly locate the 'Data availability' section.\n- **Hint 2**: Look for specific keywords related to data and file downloads.\n- **Hint 3**: If the link is not immediately visible, check for any external links or references to other databases.\n- **Hint 4**: Use the Ensembl database and the UCSC Genome Browser to confirm the availability of the genome files.\n- **Hint 5**: If the files are not found on the first attempt, try different search terms (e.g., \"canFam4,\" \"GSD_1.0\").\n\n### Action\n\nPlease navigate to the Ensembl database and search for the dog genome (canFam4 or GSD_1.0). Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to look for keywords like 'data availability,' 'supplementary materials,' 'download,' or 'files.' If the 'Data availability' section is not immediately visible, scroll down the page systematically to ensure thorough coverage. Look for links to supplementary materials or additional resources that might contain the genome files."}
