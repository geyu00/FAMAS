{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the link to the GFF3 file for beluga whales that was the most recent one on 20/10/2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The date of interest is 20/10/2020.\n   - The file type of interest is a GFF3 file.\n   - The species of interest is the beluga whale.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific GFF3 file for beluga whales released on or before 20/10/2020.\n   - The source where the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales can be found (likely a genomic database such as NCBI, Ensembl, or a specialized marine mammal genomics resource).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Verification that the identified GFF3 file is indeed the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most likely source for the GFF3 file would be a reputable genomic database like NCBI's GenBank or Ensembl, which regularly updates and maintains genomic data for various species, including beluga whales.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Source**: Use WebSurfer to search for the most reliable genomic database that hosts GFF3 files for beluga whales.\n- **Locate the File**: Once the database is identified, use WebSurfer to navigate to the section containing beluga whale genomic data and find the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n- **Verify the Date**: Ensure that the file found is indeed the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n- **Extract the Link**: Use WebSurfer to extract the direct link to the GFF3 file.\n- **Report the Result**: Provide the extracted link to the GFF3 file."}

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The date of interest is 20/10/2020.\n   - The file type of interest is a GFF3 file.\n   - The species of interest is the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas).\n   - Ensembl is a reputable genomic database that hosts genomic data for various species, including beluga whales.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific GFF3 file for beluga whales released on or before 20/10/2020.\n   - The exact FTP directory or download link for the GFF3 file on the Ensembl FTP site.\n   - The release date of the GFF3 file to verify it is the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Verification that the identified GFF3 file is indeed the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most likely source for the GFF3 file is the Ensembl FTP site, given that Ensembl is a well-maintained and comprehensive genomic database.\n   - The FTP directory structure on Ensembl typically follows a standardized format, which can help in locating the specific GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n   - The release notes or README files in the FTP directories often contain information about the release dates of the files, which can be used to verify the most recent file as of 20/10/2020.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Ensembl FTP Site**: Given the extensive and well-organized nature of the Ensembl FTP site, it is highly likely that the GFF3 file for beluga whales is available there. The FTP site is a standard resource for downloading large genomic datasets.\n- **Directory Structure**: Ensembl's FTP site follows a consistent directory structure, which can help in navigating to the correct location for the beluga whale GFF3 file.\n- **Release Notes and README Files**: These files often contain crucial information about the release dates and versions of the genomic data, which can be used to verify the most recent file as of 20/10/2020.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Navigate to the Ensembl FTP site and locate the directory for beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) genomic data.\n- Check the release notes or README files to verify the release date of the GFF3 file.\n- Extract the direct link to the GFF3 file and verify that it is the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation Path**: The search for the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) GFF3 file led to a search results page instead of the FTP download section.\n2. **Lack of Direct Action**: The steps did not explicitly guide the WebSurfer to the FTP download section for the beluga whale genomic data.\n3. **Verification Overlooked**: There was no clear step to verify the release date of the GFF3 file to ensure it is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the FTP Download Section**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to the Ensembl FTP download page: `https://ftp.ensembl.org/`.\n   - Navigate to the directory for beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) genomic data.\n\n2. **Locate the GFF3 File**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to search for the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) directory within the FTP site.\n   - Identify the GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n\n3. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   - Check the release notes or README files in the directory to verify the release date of the GFF3 file.\n   - Ensure the file is the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n4. **Extract the Direct Link**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to extract the direct link to the GFF3 file.\n\n5. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the extracted link to the GFF3 file and confirm the release date.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the FTP Download Section**:\n   - Open the Ensembl FTP download page: `https://ftp.ensembl.org/`.\n\n2. **Locate the Beluga Whale Directory**:\n   - Search for the directory containing the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) genomic data.\n   - Example path: `pub/release-XX/fasta/delphinapterus_leucas/` (replace `XX` with the relevant release number).\n\n3. **Identify the GFF3 File**:\n   - Look for the GFF3 file in the directory.\n   - Example file name: `delphinapterus_leucas.XX.gff3.gz` (replace `XX` with the relevant release number).\n\n4. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   - Check the README file in the directory for the release date.\n   - Ensure the file is the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n5. **Extract the Direct Link**:\n   - Copy the direct link to the GFF3 file.\n\n6. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the direct link to the GFF3 file and confirm the release date.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**: When navigating the FTP site, use specific search terms like \"Delphinapterus leucas\" to find the relevant directory.\n- **Check Release Notes**: Always check the README or release notes files to verify the release date.\n- **Direct Link Extraction**: Ensure the direct link is copied accurately to avoid any broken links.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps to find the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the link to the GFF3 file for beluga whales that was the most recent one on 20/10/2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser.

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet, incorporating the new information and insights gained from our attempts:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The date of interest is 20/10/2020.\n   - The file type of interest is a GFF3 file.\n   - The species of interest is the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas).\n   - Ensembl is a reputable genomic database that hosts genomic data for various species, including beluga whales.\n   - The Ensembl FTP site is organized into directories for different species and file types, such as GFF3 files.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific GFF3 file for beluga whales released on or before 20/10/2020.\n   - The exact FTP directory or download link for the GFF3 file on the Ensembl FTP site.\n   - The release date of the GFF3 file to verify it is the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Verification that the identified GFF3 file is indeed the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most likely source for the GFF3 file is the Ensembl FTP site, given that Ensembl is a well-maintained and comprehensive genomic database.\n   - The FTP directory structure on Ensembl typically follows a standardized format, which can help in locating the specific GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n   - The release notes or README files in the FTP directories often contain information about the release dates of the files, which can be used to verify the most recent file as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) directory might be located under the 'current_gff3' directory, as this is a common structure for recent releases on the Ensembl FTP site.\n   - If the beluga whale directory is not found in the 'current_gff3' directory, it might be located in a previous release directory, such as 'release-XX/gff3/delphinapterus_leucas/' (replace XX with the relevant release number).\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Ensembl FTP Site**: The Ensembl FTP site is a reliable source for genomic data, and it is structured in a way that makes it easy to navigate to specific species and file types.\n- **Directory Structure**: The 'current_gff3' directory is a logical place to look for the most recent GFF3 files, but if the species is not listed there, it might be in a previous release directory.\n- **Release Notes and README Files**: These files are crucial for verifying the release dates and ensuring that the file is the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n- **Previous Release Directories**: If the beluga whale directory is not found in the 'current_gff3' directory, it might be in a previous release directory, which could be named after the specific release version.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the FTP Download Section**:\n   - Open the Ensembl FTP download page: `https://ftp.ensembl.org/`.\n   - Navigate to the 'pub' directory.\n\n2. **Locate the Beluga Whale Directory**:\n   - Search for the 'current_gff3' directory.\n   - Check if the 'delphinapterus_leucas' directory is present in the 'current_gff3' directory.\n   - If not found, navigate to previous release directories (e.g., 'release-XX/gff3/delphinapterus_leucas/') to locate the GFF3 file.\n\n3. **Identify the GFF3 File**:\n   - Look for the GFF3 file in the directory.\n   - Example file name: `delphinapterus_leucas.XX.gff3.gz` (replace XX with the relevant release number).\n\n4. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   - Check the README file in the directory for the release date.\n   - Ensure the file is the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n5. **Extract the Direct Link**:\n   - Copy the direct link to the GFF3 file.\n\n6. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the extracted link to the GFF3 file and confirm the release date.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the FTP Download Section**:\n   - Open the Ensembl FTP download page: `https://ftp.ensembl.org/`.\n\n2. **Locate the 'pub' Directory**:\n   - Click on the 'pub' directory.\n\n3. **Search for the 'current_gff3' Directory**:\n   - Click on the 'current_gff3' directory.\n\n4. **Check for the 'delphinapterus_leucas' Directory**:\n   - Look for the 'delphinapterus_leucas' directory in the 'current_gff3' directory.\n   - If not found, navigate to previous release directories (e.g., 'release-XX/gff3/delphinapterus_leucas/').\n\n5. **Identify the GFF3 File**:\n   - Find the GFF3 file in the directory.\n   - Example file name: `delphinapterus_leucas.XX.gff3.gz`.\n\n6. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   - Check the README file for the release date.\n   - Ensure the file is the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n7. **Extract the Direct Link**:\n   - Copy the direct link to the GFF3 file.\n\n8. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the direct link to the GFF3 file and confirm the release date.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**: When navigating the FTP site, use specific search terms like \"Delphinapterus leucas\" to find the relevant directory.\n- **Check Release Notes**: Always check the README or release notes files to verify the release date.\n- **Direct Link Extraction**: Ensure the direct link is copied accurately to avoid any broken links.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps to find the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020. Please navigate to the 'pub' directory and then to the 'current_gff3' directory to start the search.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation Path**: The WebSurfer navigated to incorrect directories (e.g., 'buteo_japonicus' and 'panthera_pardus') instead of the 'delphinapterus_leucas' directory.\n2. **Lack of Specific Search**: The WebSurfer did not use specific search terms or methods to locate the 'delphinapterus_leucas' directory within the 'current_gff3' directory.\n3. **No Fallback Plan**: There was no plan in place to navigate to previous release directories if the 'delphinapterus_leucas' directory was not found in the 'current_gff3' directory.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the FTP Download Section**:\n   - Open the Ensembl FTP download page: `https://ftp.ensembl.org/`.\n   - Click on the 'pub' directory.\n\n2. **Locate the 'current_gff3' Directory**:\n   - Click on the 'current_gff3' directory.\n\n3. **Search for the 'delphinapterus_leucas' Directory**:\n   - Use the search function or scroll through the list to find the 'delphinapterus_leucas' directory.\n   - If the directory is not found, note this and proceed to the next step.\n\n4. **Navigate to Previous Release Directories**:\n   - If the 'delphinapterus_leucas' directory is not found in the 'current_gff3' directory, navigate to the 'release-XX' directories (e.g., 'release-102', 'release-101', etc.).\n   - Click on each release directory and check the 'gff3' subdirectory for the 'delphinapterus_leucas' directory.\n\n5. **Identify the GFF3 File**:\n   - Once the 'delphinapterus_leucas' directory is found, look for the GFF3 file.\n   - Example file name: `delphinapterus_leucas.XX.gff3.gz` (replace XX with the relevant release number).\n\n6. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   - Check the README file in the directory for the release date.\n   - Ensure the file is the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n7. **Extract the Direct Link**:\n   - Copy the direct link to the GFF3 file.\n\n8. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the extracted link to the GFF3 file and confirm the release date.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**: When navigating the FTP site, use specific search terms like \"Delphinapterus leucas\" to find the relevant directory.\n- **Check Release Notes**: Always check the README or release notes files to verify the release date.\n- **Direct Link Extraction**: Ensure the direct link is copied accurately to avoid any broken links.\n- **Fallback Plan**: If the 'delphinapterus_leucas' directory is not found in the 'current_gff3' directory, systematically check previous release directories.\n\nPlease proceed with these steps to find the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020. Start by navigating to the 'pub' directory and then to the 'current_gff3' directory."}

Detailed specification of the format is maintained by the Sequence Ontology: https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md GFF3 files are validated using GenomeTools: http://genometools.org For chromosomal assemblies, in addition to a file containing all genes, there are per-chromosome files. If a predicted geneset is available (generated by Genscan and other ab initio tools), these genes are in a separate 'abinitio' file. The 'type' of gene features is: * \"gene\" for protein-coding genes * \"ncRNA_gene\" for RNA genes * \"pseudogene\" for pseudogenes The 'type' of transcript features is: * \"mRNA\" for protein-coding transcripts * a specific type or RNA transcript such as \"snoRNA\" or \"lnc_RNA\" * \"pseudogenic_transcript\" for pseudogenes All transcripts are linked to \"exon\" features. Protein-coding transcripts are linked to \"CDS\", \"five_prime_UTR\", and \"three_prime_UTR\" features. Attributes for feature types: (square brackets indicate data which is not available for all features) * region types: * ID: Unique identifier, format \"<region_type>:<region_name>\" * [Alias]: A comma-separated list of aliases, usually including the INSDC accession * [Is_circular]: Flag to indicate circular regions * gene types: * ID: Unique identifier, format \"gene:<gene_stable_id>\" * biotype: Ensembl biotype, e.g. \"protein_coding\", \"pseudogene\" * gene_id: Ensembl gene stable ID * version: Ensembl gene version * [Name]: Gene name * [description]: Gene description * transcript types: * ID: Unique identifier, format \"transcript:<transcript_stable_id>\" * Parent: Gene identifier, format \"gene:<gene_stable_id>\" * biotype: Ensembl biotype, e.g. \"protein_coding\", \"pseudogene\" * transcript_id: Ensembl transcript stable ID * version: Ensembl transcript version * [Note]: If the transcript sequence has been edited (i.e. differs from the genomic sequence), the edits are described in a note. * exon * Parent: Transcript identifier, format \"transcript:<transcript_stable_id>\" * exon_id: Ensembl exon stable ID * version: Ensembl exon version * constitutive: Flag to indicate if exon is present in all transcripts * rank: Integer that show the 5'->3' ordering of exons * CDS * ID: Unique identifier, format \"CDS:<protein_stable_id>\" * Parent: Transcript identifier, format \"transcript:<transcript_stable_id>\" * protein_id: Ensembl protein stable ID * version: Ensembl protein version Metadata: * genome-build - Build identifier of the assembly e.g. GRCh37.p11 * genome-version - Version of this assembly e.g. GRCh37 * genome-date - The date of the release of this assembly e.g. 2009-02 * genome-build-accession - Genome accession e.g. GCA_000001405.14 * genebuild-last-updated - Date of the last genebuild update e.g. 2013-09 ----------- FILE NAMES ------------ The files are consistently named following this pattern: <species>.<assembly>.<_version>.gff3.gz <species>: The systematic name of the species. <assembly>: The assembly build name. <version>: The version of Ensembl from which the data was exported. gff3 : All files in these directories are in GFF3 format gz : All files are compacted with GNU Zip for storage efficiency. e.g. Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.81.gff3.gz For the predicted gene set, an additional abinitio flag is added to the name file. <species>.<assembly>.<version>.abinitio.gff3.gz e.g. Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.81.abinitio.gff3.gz ------------------ Example GFF3 output ------------------ ##gff-version 3 #!genome-build Pmarinus_7.0 #!genome-version Pmarinus_7.0 #!genome-date 2011-01 #!genebuild-last-updated 2013-04 GL476399 Pmarinus_7.0 supercontig 1 4695893 . . .
