Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The artist in question is the \"King of Pop,\" which is Michael Jackson.\n   - The request is about the fifth single from his sixth studio album.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The title of Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.\n   - The list of singles released from that album, specifically the fifth single.\n   - The lyrics of the fifth single, particularly the section leading up to the second chorus.\n   - These facts can be found on authoritative music databases like AllMusic, official Michael Jackson discographies, and lyric websites such as Genius.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify the exact position of the second chorus in the song.\n   - Determine the last word before the second chorus based on the lyrics.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Michael Jackson's sixth studio album is likely \"Dangerous\" (released in 1991), but this needs verification.\n   - The fifth single from \"Dangerous\" is often cited as \"Will You Be There,\" but this also needs confirmation.\n   - Based on typical song structures, the second chorus is usually after the first verse and bridge, but the exact placement varies by song.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Sixth Studio Album of Michael Jackson**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to confirm the title of Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.\n  \n- **Identify the Fifth Single from the Album**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Once the album title is confirmed, search for the list of singles from that album and identify the fifth single.\n  \n- **Find the Lyrics of the Fifth Single**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for the lyrics of the identified fifth single.\n  \n- **Locate the Second Chorus and Identify the Last Word Before It**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Analyze the lyrics to locate the second chorus and determine the last word before it.\n\n- **Verify the Information**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information with multiple reliable sources if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Report the Result**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer and provide it to the user."}

It was produced by \nQuincy Jones, who previously worked with Jackson on his album \nOff the Wall (1979). With the ongoing backlash against \ndisco music at the time, he moved in a new musical direction, resulting in a mix of \npop, \npost-disco, \nrock, \nfunk, \nsynth-pop, and \nR&B sounds, and darker themes; Jackson wanted to create an album where \"every song was a killer\". \nPaul McCartney appears as the first credited featured artist on a Jackson album. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at \nWestlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with a budget of $750,000. \nUpon its release, \nThriller was lauded by critics. It was Jackson's first number-one album on the US \nBillboard Top LPs & Tapes chart, where it spent a record 37 non-consecutive weeks at number one, from February 26, 1983, to April 14, 1984. Seven singles were released: \"\nThe Girl Is Mine\", \"\nBillie Jean\", \"\nBeat It\", \"\nWanna Be Startin' Somethin'\", \"\nHuman Nature\", \"\nP.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\", and \"\nThriller\". They all reached the top 10 on the US \nBillboard Hot 100 chart, setting a record for the \nmost top 10 singles from an album, with \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\" reaching number one. Following Jackson's performance of \"Billie Jean\" in the \nMotown 25 television special, where he debuted his signature \nmoonwalk dance, the album began selling one million copies per week. Sales doubled after the release of the \n\"Thriller\" music video on \nMTV in December 1983. \nBy 1984, \nThriller had sold 32 million copies worldwide, making it the \nbest-selling album of all time. It was the best-selling album of 1983 worldwide, and in 1984 became the first to become the \nbest-selling in the United States for two years. It set industry standards, with its songs, music videos, and promotional strategies influencing artists, record labels, producers, marketers and choreographers.

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The artist in question is the \"King of Pop,\" which is Michael Jackson.\n   - The request is about the fifth single from his sixth studio album.\n   - Michael Jackson's sixth studio album is \"Thriller,\" released on November 29, 1982.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of singles released from the \"Thriller\" album, specifically the fifth single.\n   - The lyrics of the fifth single, particularly the section leading up to the second chorus.\n   - These facts can be found on authoritative music databases like AllMusic, official Michael Jackson discographies, and lyric websites such as Genius.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify the exact position of the second chorus in the song.\n   - Determine the last word before the second chorus based on the lyrics.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The fifth single from \"Thriller\" is likely \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin',\" but this needs confirmation.\n   - Based on typical song structures, the second chorus is usually after the first verse and bridge, but the exact placement varies by song.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Fifth Single**: The track listing and the order of singles from the \"Thriller\" album suggest that \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" could be the fifth single. However, this needs to be confirmed from a reliable source.\n- **Song Structure**: Typical pop songs often follow a structure where the second chorus comes after the first verse and bridge. This is a common pattern, but each song can vary, so we need to verify the specific structure of the identified fifth single.\n\nLet's proceed with confirming the fifth single from the \"Thriller\" album. Can you search for the list of singles from Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' album and identify the fifth single?\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Misidentification of the Album**: Initially, there was a misunderstanding that Michael Jackson's sixth studio album was \"Dangerous.\" However, the correct album is \"Thriller.\"\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: The web searches and navigation through the Wikipedia page were not focused enough to quickly identify the list of singles and the fifth single.\n- **Lack of Direct Confirmation**: We did not directly confirm the fifth single from the \"Thriller\" album, leading to confusion and incorrect assumptions.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Confirm the List of Singles from \"Thriller\"**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find a reliable source listing the singles from Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" album.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open the Wikipedia page for \"Thriller\" and navigate to the section that lists the singles.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the fifth single from the list.\n\n- **Find the Lyrics of the Fifth Single**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for the lyrics of the identified fifth single on a reputable lyrics website like Genius.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Locate the section of the lyrics leading up to the second chorus.\n\n- **Identify the Last Word Before the Second Chorus**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Analyze the lyrics to determine the exact position of the second chorus.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last word before the second chorus.\n\n- **Verify the Information**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information with multiple reliable sources if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Report the Result**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer and provide it to the user.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n1. **Confirm the List of Singles from \"Thriller\"**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"list of singles from Michael Jackson's Thriller album.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Wikipedia page for \"Thriller\" and navigate to the section that lists the singles.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the fifth single from the list.\n\n2. **Find the Lyrics of the Fifth Single**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the lyrics of the identified fifth single on Genius or another reputable lyrics website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Locate the section of the lyrics leading up to the second chorus.\n\n3. **Identify the Last Word Before the Second Chorus**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Analyze the lyrics to determine the exact position of the second chorus.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last word before the second chorus.\n\n4. **Verify the Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information with multiple reliable sources if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Report the Result**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer and provide it to the user.\n\nLet's start with the first step.

It was produced by \nQuincy Jones, who previously worked with Jackson on his album \nOff the Wall (1979). With the ongoing backlash against \ndisco music at the time, he moved in a new musical direction, resulting in a mix of \npop, \npost-disco, \nrock, \nfunk, \nsynth-pop, and \nR&B sounds, and darker themes; Jackson wanted to create an album where \"every song was a killer\". \nPaul McCartney appears as the first credited featured artist on a Jackson album. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at \nWestlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with a budget of $750,000. \nUpon its release, \nThriller was lauded by critics. It was Jackson's first number-one album on the US \nBillboard Top LPs & Tapes chart, where it spent a record 37 non-consecutive weeks at number one, from February 26, 1983, to April 14, 1984. Seven singles were released: \"\nThe Girl Is Mine\", \"\nBillie Jean\", \"\nBeat It\", \"\nWanna Be Startin' Somethin'\", \"\nHuman Nature\", \"\nP.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\", and \"\nThriller\". They all reached the top 10 on the US \nBillboard Hot 100 chart, setting a record for the \nmost top 10 singles from an album, with \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\" reaching number one. Following Jackson's performance of \"Billie Jean\" in the \nMotown 25 television special, where he debuted his signature \nmoonwalk dance, the album began selling one million copies per week. Sales doubled after the release of the \n\"Thriller\" music video on \nMTV in December 1983. \nBy 1984, \nThriller had sold 32 million copies worldwide, making it the \nbest-selling album of all time. It was the best-selling album of 1983 worldwide, and in 1984 became the first to become the \nbest-selling in the United States for two years. It set industry standards, with its songs, music videos, and promotional strategies influencing artists, record labels, producers, marketers and choreographers.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the last word before the second chorus of the King of Pop's fifth single from his sixth studio album?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser.

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The artist in question is the \"King of Pop,\" which is Michael Jackson.\n   - The request is about the fifth single from his sixth studio album.\n   - Michael Jackson's sixth studio album is \"Thriller,\" released on November 29, 1982.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of singles released from the \"Thriller\" album, specifically the fifth single.\n   - The lyrics of the fifth single, particularly the section leading up to the second chorus.\n   - These facts can be found on authoritative music databases like AllMusic, official Michael Jackson discographies, and lyric websites such as Genius.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify the exact position of the second chorus in the song.\n   - Determine the last word before the second chorus based on the lyrics.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The fifth single from \"Thriller\" is likely \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin',\" but this needs confirmation.\n   - Based on typical song structures, the second chorus is usually after the first verse and bridge, but the exact placement varies by song.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Fifth Single**: The track listing and the order of singles from the \"Thriller\" album suggest that \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" could be the fifth single. However, this needs to be confirmed from a reliable source.\n- **Song Structure**: Typical pop songs often follow a structure where the second chorus comes after the first verse and bridge. This is a common pattern, but each song can vary, so we need to verify the specific structure of the identified fifth single.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Confirm the List of Singles from \"Thriller\"**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"list of singles from Michael Jackson's Thriller album.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Wikipedia page for \"Thriller\" and navigate to the section that lists the singles.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the fifth single from the list.\n\n2. **Find the Lyrics of the Fifth Single**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the lyrics of the identified fifth single on Genius or another reputable lyrics website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Locate the section of the lyrics leading up to the second chorus.\n\n3. **Identify the Last Word Before the Second Chorus**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Analyze the lyrics to determine the exact position of the second chorus.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last word before the second chorus.\n\n4. **Verify the Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information with multiple reliable sources if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Report the Result**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer and provide it to the user.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n1. **Confirm the List of Singles from \"Thriller\"**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"list of singles from Michael Jackson's Thriller album.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Wikipedia page for \"Thriller\" and navigate to the section that lists the singles.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the fifth single from the list.\n\n2. **Find the Lyrics of the Fifth Single**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the lyrics of the identified fifth single on Genius or another reputable lyrics website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Locate the section of the lyrics leading up to the second chorus.\n\n3. **Identify the Last Word Before the Second Chorus**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Analyze the lyrics to determine the exact position of the second chorus.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last word before the second chorus.\n\n4. **Verify the Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information with multiple reliable sources if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Report the Result**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer and provide it to the user.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Can you perform a web search for \"list of singles from Michael Jackson's Thriller album\" and identify the fifth single?\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Misidentification of the Album**: Initially, there was a misunderstanding that Michael Jackson's sixth studio album was \"Dangerous.\" However, the correct album is \"Thriller.\"\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: The web searches and navigation through the Wikipedia page were not focused enough to quickly identify the list of singles and the fifth single.\n- **Lack of Direct Confirmation**: We did not directly confirm the fifth single from the \"Thriller\" album, leading to confusion and incorrect assumptions.\n- **Repetition of Actions**: We repeatedly navigated to the wrong sections of the Wikipedia page, such as \"Track listing\" and \"Personnel,\" instead of the \"Charts\" section which contains the list of singles.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Confirm the List of Singles from \"Thriller\"**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"list of singles from Michael Jackson's Thriller album.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Wikipedia page for \"Thriller\" and navigate to the \"Charts\" section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the fifth single from the list of singles.\n\n2. **Find the Lyrics of the Fifth Single**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the lyrics of the identified fifth single on Genius or another reputable lyrics website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Locate the section of the lyrics leading up to the second chorus.\n\n3. **Identify the Last Word Before the Second Chorus**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Analyze the lyrics to determine the exact position of the second chorus.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last word before the second chorus.\n\n4. **Verify the Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information with multiple reliable sources if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Report the Result**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer and provide it to the user.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n1. **Confirm the List of Singles from \"Thriller\"**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"list of singles from Michael Jackson's Thriller album.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Wikipedia page for \"Thriller\" and navigate to the \"Charts\" section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the fifth single from the list of singles.\n\n2. **Find the Lyrics of the Fifth Single**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the lyrics of the identified fifth single on Genius or another reputable lyrics website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Locate the section of the lyrics leading up to the second chorus.\n\n3. **Identify the Last Word Before the Second Chorus**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Analyze the lyrics to determine the exact position of the second chorus.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last word before the second chorus.\n\n4. **Verify the Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information with multiple reliable sources if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Report the Result**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer and provide it to the user.\n\nLet's start with the first step.

With the ongoing backlash against \ndisco music at the time, he moved in a new musical direction, resulting in a mix of \npop, \npost-disco, \nrock, \nfunk, \nsynth-pop, and \nR&B sounds, and darker themes; Jackson wanted to create an album where \"every song was a killer\". \nPaul McCartney appears as the first credited featured artist on a Jackson album. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at \nWestlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with a budget of $750,000. \nUpon its release, \nThriller was lauded by critics. It was Jackson's first number-one album on the US \nBillboard Top LPs & Tapes chart, where it spent a record 37 non-consecutive weeks at number one, from February 26, 1983, to April 14, 1984. Seven singles were released: \"\nThe Girl Is Mine\", \"\nBillie Jean\", \"\nBeat It\", \"\nWanna Be Startin' Somethin'\", \"\nHuman Nature\", \"\nP.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\", and \"\nThriller\". They all reached the top 10 on the US \nBillboard Hot 100 chart, setting a record for the \nmost top 10 singles from an album, with \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\" reaching number one. Following Jackson's performance of \"Billie Jean\" in the \nMotown 25 television special, where he debuted his signature \nmoonwalk dance, the album began selling one million copies per week. Sales doubled after the release of the \n\"Thriller\" music video on \nMTV in December 1983. \nBy 1984, \nThriller had sold 32 million copies worldwide, making it the \nbest-selling album of all time. It was the best-selling album of 1983 worldwide, and in 1984 became the first to become the \nbest-selling in the United States for two years. It set industry standards, with its songs, music videos, and promotional strategies influencing artists, record labels, producers, marketers and choreographers.

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The artist in question is the \"King of Pop,\" which is Michael Jackson.\n   - The request is about the fifth single from his sixth studio album.\n   - Michael Jackson's sixth studio album is \"Thriller,\" released on November 29, 1982.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of singles released from the \"Thriller\" album, specifically the fifth single.\n   - The lyrics of the fifth single, particularly the section leading up to the second chorus.\n   - These facts can be found on authoritative music databases like AllMusic, official Michael Jackson discographies, and lyric websites such as Genius.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify the exact position of the second chorus in the song.\n   - Determine the last word before the second chorus based on the lyrics.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The fifth single from \"Thriller\" is likely \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin',\" but this needs confirmation.\n   - Based on typical song structures, the second chorus is usually after the first verse and bridge, but the exact placement varies by song.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Fifth Single**: The track listing and the order of singles from the \"Thriller\" album suggest that \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" could be the fifth single. However, this needs to be confirmed from a reliable source.\n- **Song Structure**: Typical pop songs often follow a structure where the second chorus comes after the first verse and bridge. This is a common pattern, but each song can vary, so we need to verify the specific structure of the identified fifth single.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Confirm the List of Singles from \"Thriller\"**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"list of singles from Michael Jackson's Thriller album.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Wikipedia page for \"Thriller\" and navigate to the section that lists the singles.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the fifth single from the list.\n\n2. **Find the Lyrics of the Fifth Single**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the lyrics of the identified fifth single on Genius or another reputable lyrics website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Locate the section of the lyrics leading up to the second chorus.\n\n3. **Identify the Last Word Before the Second Chorus**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Analyze the lyrics to determine the exact position of the second chorus.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last word before the second chorus.\n\n4. **Verify the Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information with multiple reliable sources if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Report the Result**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer and provide it to the user.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n1. **Confirm the List of Singles from \"Thriller\"**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"list of singles from Michael Jackson's Thriller album.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Wikipedia page for \"Thriller\" and navigate to the section that lists the singles.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the fifth single from the list.\n\n2. **Find the Lyrics of the Fifth Single**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the lyrics of the identified fifth single on Genius or another reputable lyrics website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Locate the section of the lyrics leading up to the second chorus.\n\n3. **Identify the Last Word Before the Second Chorus**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Analyze the lyrics to determine the exact position of the second chorus.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last word before the second chorus.\n\n4. **Verify the Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information with multiple reliable sources if necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Report the Result**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer and provide it to the user.\n\nLet's start with the first step.

It was produced by \nQuincy Jones, who previously worked with Jackson on his album \nOff the Wall (1979). With the ongoing backlash against \ndisco music at the time, he moved in a new musical direction, resulting in a mix of \npop, \npost-disco, \nrock, \nfunk, \nsynth-pop, and \nR&B sounds, and darker themes; Jackson wanted to create an album where \"every song was a killer\". \nPaul McCartney appears as the first credited featured artist on a Jackson album. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at \nWestlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with a budget of $750,000. \nUpon its release, \nThriller was lauded by critics. It was Jackson's first number-one album on the US \nBillboard Top LPs & Tapes chart, where it spent a record 37 non-consecutive weeks at number one, from February 26, 1983, to April 14, 1984. Seven singles were released: \"\nThe Girl Is Mine\", \"\nBillie Jean\", \"\nBeat It\", \"\nWanna Be Startin' Somethin'\", \"\nHuman Nature\", \"\nP.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\", and \"\nThriller\". They all reached the top 10 on the US \nBillboard Hot 100 chart, setting a record for the \nmost top 10 singles from an album, with \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\" reaching number one. Following Jackson's performance of \"Billie Jean\" in the \nMotown 25 television special, where he debuted his signature \nmoonwalk dance, the album began selling one million copies per week. Sales doubled after the release of the \n\"Thriller\" music video on \nMTV in December 1983. \nBy 1984, \nThriller had sold 32 million copies worldwide, making it the \nbest-selling album of all time. It was the best-selling album of 1983 worldwide, and in 1984 became the first to become the \nbest-selling in the United States for two years. It set industry standards, with its songs, music videos, and promotional strategies influencing artists, record labels, producers, marketers and choreographers.
