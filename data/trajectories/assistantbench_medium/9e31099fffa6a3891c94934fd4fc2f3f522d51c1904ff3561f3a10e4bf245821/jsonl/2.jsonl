{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question is about the C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The focus is on identifying which of these individuals did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The current C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The date of monday.com's IPO.\n   - The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of the IPO.\n   - Sources: Official monday.com website, press releases, SEC filings, and news articles from around the time of the IPO.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Comparison of the current C-suite members with those who were in place during the IPO to identify any changes.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that the CEO and some key executives have remained in their positions since the IPO, but there may have been changes in other roles such as CFO, CTO, or COO.\n   - Given the rapid growth and evolution of tech companies, it is plausible that some C-suite positions have been added or changed hands since the IPO.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** WebSurfer will search for the official monday.com website and navigate to the \"About Us\" or \"Leadership\" section to gather the current C-suite members.\n- **Step 2:** WebSurfer will search for news articles, press releases, and SEC filings related to monday.com's IPO to find the date of the IPO and the C-suite members at that time.\n- **Step 3:** Compare the current C-suite members with those from the IPO period to identify any differences.\n- **Step 4:** If necessary, WebSurfer will look up additional information on any identified changes to confirm the exact timeline of when the changes occurred.\n- **Step 5:** Compile the findings and identify which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO."}

Goldman Sachs is leading the IPO and the company plans to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “MNDY.”\nUnlike most S-1's, Monday's starts with a letter from the founders that describes their mission: \"to give our customers the power to create their own work software.\" The company also calls this new category of software Work OS, which \"democratizes the power of software so organizations can easily build software applications and work management tools that fit their needs.\" According to the S-1, the company has raised $234M, and most recently a $150M round led by Sapphire at a $1.9B valuation in June of 2019 (more on their investors below). The company will hope for a more controlled pricing vs. \nSquarespace, another SaaS IPO that went public this week which is roughly at their reference price of $50/share and 35% below their last funding round at $10B in March (as of 20-May-2021). Squarespace went public through a direct listing and Monday will go out through a traditional IPO.\nMonday's product is a highly configurable (and collaborative) set of software building blocks where users can build their own workflows and is the first IPO from the next generation of low-code tools from companies like Airtable, ClickUp, and Notion. Monday offers a pliable, no-code way for users (both technical and non-technical) to create their own software applications and workflows through categories of building blocks. The company mentions that across their 127,974 customers, there are thousands of use-cases, mostly in 3 main categories 1) business-critical software applications, 2) work management tools and 3) connective layers to form a unified workplace and integrate applications across an organization. More practically speaking, it includes things such as project management, task management, inventory tracking, issue tracking, building your own CRM, etc. More on the product later in this post.\n×\n By using this website, you consent to the real-time collection, storage, use, and sharing of personal information using cookies and other session-replay technologies by Meritech and/or its third-party partners, including in connection with the videos on our site.

The company was formerly called DaPulse and changed their name to Monday.com in 2018. Their numbers are impressive; the company is at $236M of ARRR (annualized revenue run rate), growing 85% YoY with 121% net dollar retention (for customers with more than 10 users). One of the more impressive stats was that they have \n*only* burned $121M to get to almost $240M of revenue run-rate, which is unusual for a SaaS company. The company attributes this to their self-serve adoption and ensuring the product can enable users to get up and running immediately and instantly gain value, thus also creating organic expansion. Monday is headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel, has offices in New York City and Sydney and as of March 31st, 2021, had 799 employees.

The company’s no-code and low-code framework consists of modular building blocks that are simple enough for anyone to assemble yet powerful enough to build solutions that drive the core functionality of any organization in any vertical. On top of Work OS, Monday is building Product Solutions using its building blocks and apps to answer specific needs for verticals such as marketing, CRM, project management, software development and more. An overview of the primary components of the Work OS platform are included below:\nBoards: Capture data and manage processes. Monday’s boards are at the core of its platform, as they are the starting point on which all functionality on the platform is built. Each board has the infrastructure of a schemaless database with an easy-to-use interface, which users can easily customize, populate and build applications on top of. Boards consist of items, which are individual rows in the board, and columns, which represent a single type of data. Users can start from a blank slate or with one of ~130 templates.\nViews: Allow a board’s contents to be visualized and interacted with in a way that suits a user’s needs. Users can update their data within any view they choose, with these changes reflected on the board in real-time. With the company’s growing views store, users can visualize and manipulate data on the board to fit any need, vertical or industry. Any developer or user can create their own custom views as well.\nForms: Capture additional data through web-based forms that are easily populated by their recipients, including non-monday.com users. Each response creates a new item within the board, with all of the data supplied by the recipient automatically populated in the relevant columns. \n×\n By using this website, you consent to the real-time collection, storage, use, and sharing of personal information using cookies and other session-replay technologies by Meritech and/or its third-party partners, including in connection with the videos on our site.

Each response creates a new item within the board, with all of the data supplied by the recipient automatically populated in the relevant columns. \nAutomations: Once a board is populated with items and columns, the platform can be used to easily build automations. Automations are triggered based on actions that occur or thresholds that are reached and can include notifications, item creation, assignment of ownership and due date, and moving an item to another board.\nIntegrations: Allow users to connect with external tools to share data and automate actions across tools. Currently, the company’s integration center includes 40 integrations to other tools such as Gmail, Outlook, Jira, Salesforce, Google Drive, Dropbox, Stripe, Slack and Zendesk. Integrations can also be built.\nDashboards: Users can create dashboards with summaries and reports to track progress across all of their Monday workstreams.\n‍Workspaces: Users can organize and centralize boards and dashboards using workspaces, which are defined by any category the user chooses. In large organizations, workspaces can represent a department or a team working on a project, for example.\nMonday has recently expanded the scope of building blocks by extending its platform to external developers through a low-code framework and a new apps marketplace, allowing customers, partners and external developers to easily create their own building blocks and apps, either for private or public use. Developers and app builders can also distribute their building blocks and solutions through Monday’s apps marketplace.\nIn addition, as mobile capabilities have become a key requirement for users as more work is done outside the office, Monday has invested in its mobile development to ensure the high performance of the platform on smartphones and tablets. The company’s native mobile application is built for both iOS and Android.

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question is about the C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The focus is on identifying which of these individuals did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The current C-suite members of monday.com, as of the latest available information, include:\n     - Roy Mann: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eran Zinman: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eliran Glazer: CFO\n     - Shiran Nawi: Chief People and Legal Officer\n     - Daniel Lereya: Chief Product and Technology Officer\n     - Casey George: Chief Revenue Officer\n   - The date of monday.com's IPO is June 30, 2021.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of the IPO (June 30, 2021).\n   - Specific sources to verify the C-suite members at the time of the IPO, such as the S-1 filing, official press releases, and news articles from around the time of the IPO.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Comparison of the current C-suite members with those who were in place during the IPO to identify any changes.\n   - Identification of any new C-suite positions added since the IPO.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that the Co-CEOs, Roy Mann and Eran Zinman, have held their positions since the IPO, given their co-founding roles and the importance of their positions.\n   - The CFO position might have seen changes, as financial roles often evolve with the company's growth and public listing.\n   - The Chief People and Legal Officer and Chief Product and Technology Officer positions could have been added or changed since the IPO, reflecting the company's expansion and the need for specialized leadership.\n   - Casey George, as Chief Revenue Officer, might be a newer addition to the C-suite, given the focus on revenue growth and expansion after the IPO.\n   - Given the rapid growth and evolution of tech companies, it is plausible that some C-suite positions have been added or changed hands since the IPO, particularly in areas like technology, operations, and legal.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Co-CEOs (Roy Mann and Eran Zinman)**: As co-founders, they are likely to have maintained their positions throughout the company's growth and IPO.\n- **CFO (Eliran Glazer)**: The CFO role is crucial for a public company, and it is common for this position to see changes or additions as the company prepares for and navigates the public market.\n- **Chief People and Legal Officer (Shiran Nawi)**: This role is important for managing human resources and legal matters, which become more complex after an IPO. It is possible that this position was created or filled by a new individual to handle these responsibilities.\n- **Chief Product and Technology Officer (Daniel Lereya)**: As the company grows, the need for a dedicated leader in product and technology becomes more pronounced, suggesting this could be a newer position.\n- **Chief Revenue Officer (Casey George)**: Revenue growth is a key focus for public companies, and adding a dedicated CRO could be a strategic move post-IPO to drive sales and revenue.\n\nBy focusing on these educated guesses and verifying them with the S-1 filing and other official sources, we can more accurately determine which current C-suite members did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: Despite multiple attempts, the web surfer did not successfully navigate to the S-1 filing from June 21, 2021, which contains the critical information about the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n2. **Repetition of Steps**: The web surfer repeatedly clicked on the same links and sections without advancing to the specific S-1 filing document.\n3. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided were not specific enough to guide the web surfer to the exact section of the S-1 filing that lists the C-suite members.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the S-1 Filing**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the SEC filings page for monday.com: `https://ir.monday.com/financials-and-filings/sec-filings/default.aspx`.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Filter the filings to show only S-1 forms.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the S-1 filing dated June 21, 2021.\n\n2. **Locate the C-Suite Members Section**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the S-1 filing document to find the section that lists the C-suite members at the time of the IPO. This section is typically found in the \"Management\" or \"Executive Officers\" section of the filing.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and titles of the C-suite members listed in the S-1 filing.\n\n3. **Compare with Current C-Suite Members**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the official monday.com website and find the 'About Us' or 'Leadership' section to gather the current C-suite members.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and titles of the current C-suite members.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compare the current C-suite members with those listed in the S-1 filing to identify any changes.\n\n4. **Identify the New C-Suite Member**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the findings and provide the name and title of the individual who did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Specific Instructions**: Provide very specific instructions for each step, including the exact links to click and sections to look for.\n- **Verification**: After each major step, verify the information extracted to ensure accuracy.\n- **Patience**: Allow sufficient time for pages to load and for the web surfer to scroll through and locate the required sections.\n\n### Concise Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: WebSurfer navigates to `https://ir.monday.com/financials-and-filings/sec-filings/default.aspx`.\n- **Step 2**: WebSurfer filters the filings to show only S-1 forms.\n- **Step 3**: WebSurfer clicks on the S-1 filing dated June 21, 2021.\n- **Step 4**: WebSurfer scrolls through the S-1 filing to find the \"Management\" or \"Executive Officers\" section.\n- **Step 5**: WebSurfer extracts the names and titles of the C-suite members listed in the S-1 filing.\n- **Step 6**: WebSurfer navigates to the official monday.com website and finds the 'About Us' or 'Leadership' section.\n- **Step 7**: WebSurfer extracts the names and titles of the current C-suite members.\n- **Step 8**: WebSurfer compares the current C-suite members with those listed in the S-1 filing.\n- **Step 9**: WebSurfer identifies and summarizes the findings, providing the name and title of the individual who did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO."}

Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question is about the C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The focus is on identifying which of these individuals did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The current C-suite members of monday.com, as of the latest available information, include:\n     - Roy Mann: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eran Zinman: Co-Founder & Co-CEO\n     - Eliran Glazer: CFO\n     - Shiran Nawi: Chief People and Legal Officer\n     - Daniel Lereya: Chief Product and Technology Officer\n     - Casey George: Chief Revenue Officer\n   - The date of monday.com's IPO is June 30, 2021.\n   - The SEC filings page for monday.com is accessible at: https://ir.monday.com/financials-and-filings/sec-filings/default.aspx.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of the IPO (June 30, 2021).\n   - Specific sources to verify the C-suite members at the time of the IPO, such as the S-1 filing, official press releases, and news articles from around the time of the IPO.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Comparison of the current C-suite members with those who were in place during the IPO to identify any changes.\n   - Identification of any new C-suite positions added since the IPO.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Co-CEOs (Roy Mann and Eran Zinman)**: As co-founders, they are likely to have maintained their positions throughout the company's growth and IPO. Their roles are central to the company's vision and strategy.\n   - **CFO (Eliran Glazer)**: The CFO role is crucial for a public company, and it is common for this position to see changes or additions as the company prepares for and navigates the public market. However, given the stability and importance of the role, it is possible that Eliran Glazer has held this position since before the IPO.\n   - **Chief People and Legal Officer (Shiran Nawi)**: This role is important for managing human resources and legal matters, which become more complex after an IPO. It is possible that this position was created or filled by a new individual to handle these responsibilities, especially as the company scaled up.\n   - **Chief Product and Technology Officer (Daniel Lereya)**: As the company grows, the need for a dedicated leader in product and technology becomes more pronounced, suggesting this could be a newer position. However, it is also possible that this role existed pre-IPO but was expanded or redefined.\n   - **Chief Revenue Officer (Casey George)**: Revenue growth is a key focus for public companies, and adding a dedicated CRO could be a strategic move post-IPO to drive sales and revenue. Casey George might be a newer addition to the C-suite, given the increased emphasis on revenue generation after going public.\n   - **Other Potential Changes**: Given the rapid growth and evolution of tech companies, it is plausible that some C-suite positions have been added or changed hands since the IPO, particularly in areas like technology, operations, and legal.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Co-CEOs (Roy Mann and Eran Zinman)**: As co-founders, their continuity in leadership roles is highly likely, especially given the importance of their roles in the company's founding and growth.\n- **CFO (Eliran Glazer)**: While the CFO role is crucial, the stability and importance of the position suggest that Eliran Glazer might have been in place before the IPO, though this needs verification.\n- **Chief People and Legal Officer (Shiran Nawi)**: The complexity of HR and legal matters increases significantly post-IPO, making it likely that this position was either created or expanded.\n- **Chief Product and Technology Officer (Daniel Lereya)**: The need for a dedicated leader in product and technology is a natural progression for a growing tech company, but this role could have existed pre-IPO.\n- **Chief Revenue Officer (Casey George)**: The focus on revenue growth and the strategic importance of this role make it likely that Casey George is a newer addition, reflecting the company's post-IPO priorities.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the SEC Filings Page**:\n   - Open the SEC filings page for monday.com: https://ir.monday.com/financials-and-filings/sec-filings/default.aspx.\n   - Select the year 2021 from the dropdown menu.\n   - Filter the filings to show only S-1 forms.\n   - Click on the S-1 filing dated June 21, 2021.\n\n2. **Locate the C-Suite Members Section**:\n   - Scroll through the S-1 filing document to find the section that lists the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.
