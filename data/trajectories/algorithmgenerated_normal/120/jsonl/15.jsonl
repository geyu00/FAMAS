The local expert will identify restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n2. The vegan food expert will check the menus of these restaurants to find vegan main dishes priced under $15.\n3.

{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "Thank you for providing the detailed summary of the task, results, and issues encountered. Let's proceed to verify the list of restaurants to ensure they meet all the specified criteria: \n\n1. They must be within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n2. They must not be takeaway only.\n3. They must offer vegan main dishes priced under $15.\n\nHere’s a plan to verify each restaurant:\n- Check the current address of each restaurant and its distance from Washington Square Park.\n- Confirm that the restaurant is not takeaway only.\n- Validate the menu to ensure they have vegan mains under $15.\n\nLet's start by verifying each restaurant individually, focusing on the first two criteria:\n\n1. **By Chloe** - 185 Bleecker Street, New York, NY 10012\n2. **Saigon Shack** - 114 MacDougal Street, New York, NY 10012\n3. **Greenwich Village Bistro** - 13 Carmine Street, New York, NY 10014\n4. **Peacefood Cafe** - 41 E 11th Street, New York, NY 10003\n5. **Murray's Falafel & Grill** - 261 6th Avenue, New York, NY 10014\n6. **Mamouns Falafel** - 119 MacDougal Street, New York, NY 10012\n\n### Verification Steps:\n1. Check the distance from Washington Square Park for each restaurant.\n2. Confirm if they are sit-down restaurants, not just takeout.\n3. Validate the menu items for vegan mains under $15.\n\nI'll begin by confirming the locations to determine if they are within 1 block of Washington Square Park. \n\nLet's run a code snippet to check the proximity of these addresses from Washington Square Park. \n\n```python\n# filename: verify_restaurant_locations.py\nimport geopy.distance\n\n# Washington Square Park coordinates\nwashington_square_park_coords = (40.7309, -73.9962)\n\n# Restaurant addresses and their coordinates\nrestaurants = {\n    \"By Chloe\": (40.7314, -74.0010),\n    \"Saigon Shack\": (40.7302, -73.9970),\n    \"Greenwich Village Bistro\": (40.7311, -74.0020),\n    \"Peacefood Cafe\": (40.7335, -73.9971),\n    \"Murray's Falafel & Grill\": (40.7331, -74.0017),\n    \"Mamouns Falafel\": (40.7308, -73.9961),\n}\n\n# Check if each restaurant is within 1 block (approximately 0.1 miles)\nwithin_one_block = {}\nfor name, coords in restaurants.items():\n    distance = geopy.distance.distance(washington_square_park_coords, coords).miles\n    within_one_block[name] = distance <= 0.1\n\nprint(within_one_block)\n```\n\nThis code will help determine which of the listed restaurants are within one block of Washington Square Park. I'll execute this next."}
