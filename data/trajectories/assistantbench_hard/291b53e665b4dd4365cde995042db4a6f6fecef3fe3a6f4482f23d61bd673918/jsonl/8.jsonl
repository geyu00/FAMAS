Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is looking for a GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n   - The file should be the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The NCBI database contains a genome assembly for the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) with the accession number GCF_002288925.2, submitted by the BC Cancer Agency on August 29, 2019.\n   - The NCBI Datasets page allows downloading various file types, including GFF3 files for annotation features.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific GFF3 file for beluga whales that was the most recent on 20/10/2020.\n   - The exact date of the last update or release of the GFF3 file for the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Verify if the GFF3 file for the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2 is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020 by checking the metadata or release notes.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file for the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2 is likely the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020, given that it was the latest submission found in the NCBI database.\n   - The GFF3 file can be downloaded from the NCBI Datasets page, but we need to confirm the exact release date to ensure it meets the requirement of being the most recent as of 20/10/2020.\n   - Other databases like Ensembl might also have the GFF3 file, but NCBI appears to be the primary source for this specific assembly.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The NCBI database is a trusted and comprehensive resource for genomic data, and the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2 is the most recent one we have found so far.\n- Given the submission date of August 29, 2019, and the lack of more recent entries, it is reasonable to assume that this is the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n- Checking the metadata or release notes on the NCBI Datasets page will help confirm the exact release date and ensure the file meets the specified requirements.\n\nNext steps:\n- Extract the direct download link for the GFF3 file from the NCBI Datasets page.\n- Verify the release date of the GFF3 file to ensure it is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetition of Actions**: We repeatedly clicked on the 'Annotation features (GFF)' option without extracting the direct download link, leading to a loop of the same actions.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: We did not explicitly ask WebSurfer to extract the direct download link once the correct file type was selected.\n- **Insufficient Verification**: We did not verify the release date of the GFF3 file to ensure it was the most recent as of 20/10/2020.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Navigate to the Correct Page**: Ensure we are on the NCBI Datasets page for the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2.\n- **Select the GFF3 File Type**: Click on 'Annotation features (GFF)' to select the GFF3 file type.\n- **Extract the Direct Download Link**: Explicitly instruct WebSurfer to extract the direct download link for the GFF3 file.\n- **Verify the Release Date**: Check the metadata or release notes to ensure the file is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n- **Provide the Link**: Return the direct download link to the user.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n1. **Navigate to the NCBI Datasets Page**:\n   - Open the page [Delphinapterus leucas genome assembly ASM228892v3 - NCBI - NLM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_002288925.2/).\n\n2. **Select the GFF3 File Type**:\n   - Click on 'Download'.\n   - Select 'Annotation features (GFF)'.\n\n3. **Extract the Direct Download Link**:\n   - Scroll down to the 'Download Package' section.\n   - Extract the direct download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n4. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   - Check the metadata or release notes to confirm the release date of the GFF3 file.\n   - Ensure the file is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n5. **Provide the Link**:\n   - Return the direct download link to the user.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Be Explicit**: Clearly instruct WebSurfer to extract the direct download link once the correct file type is selected.\n- **Double-Check**: Verify the release date to ensure the file meets the specified requirements.\n- **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure each step is distinct and progresses towards the goal of finding and verifying the correct GFF3 file.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

The file should be the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The NCBI database contains a genome assembly for the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) with the accession number GCF_002288925.2, submitted by the BC Cancer Agency on August 29, 2019.\n   - The NCBI Datasets page allows downloading various file types, including GFF3 files for annotation features.\n   - The NCBI Delphinapterus leucas Annotation Release 101 was released on September 6, 2019, and includes 27,561 genes and 18,469 protein-coding genes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific GFF3 file for beluga whales that was the most recent on 20/10/2020.\n   - The exact date of the last update or release of the GFF3 file for the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Verify if the GFF3 file for the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2 is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020 by checking the metadata or release notes.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file for the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2, which is part of the NCBI Delphinapterus leucas Annotation Release 101, is likely the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020, given that it was the latest submission found in the NCBI database.\n   - The GFF3 file can be downloaded from the NCBI Datasets page, but we need to confirm the exact release date to ensure it meets the requirement of being the most recent as of 20/10/2020.\n   - Other databases like Ensembl might also have the GFF3 file, but NCBI appears to be the primary source for this specific assembly.\n   - The release date of the GFF3 file (September 6, 2019) is earlier than 20/10/2020, but there are no indications of more recent updates, suggesting that this is the most recent version available.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The NCBI database is a trusted and comprehensive resource for genomic data, and the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2 is the most recent one we have found so far.\n- Given the submission date of August 29, 2019, and the annotation release date of September 6, 2019, and the lack of more recent entries, it is reasonable to assume that this is the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n- Checking the metadata or release notes on the NCBI Datasets page will help confirm the exact release date and ensure the file meets the specified requirements.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Extract the Direct Download Link for the GFF3 File:**\n   - Scroll down to the 'Download Package' section.\n   - Ensure 'Annotation features (GFF)' is selected.\n   - Extract the direct download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n2. **Verify the Release Date:**\n   - Check the metadata or release notes to confirm the release date of the GFF3 file.\n   - Ensure the file is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **Provide the Link:**\n   - Return the direct download link to the user.\n\n### Instructions for WebSurfer\n\nPlease proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Scroll Down to the 'Download Package' Section:**\n   - Ensure 'Annotation features (GFF)' is selected.\n   - Extract the direct download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n2. **Check the Metadata or Release Notes:**\n   - Verify the release date of the GFF3 file.\n   - Ensure it is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **Return the Direct Download Link:**\n   - Provide the direct download link to the user.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetition of Actions**: We repeatedly clicked on 'Annotation features (GFF)' without extracting the direct download link, leading to a loop of the same actions.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: We did not explicitly ask WebSurfer to extract the direct download link once the correct file type was selected.\n- **Insufficient Verification**: We did not verify the release date of the GFF3 file to ensure it was the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n- **Inconsistent Scrolling**: We did not consistently scroll to the 'Download Package' section, which is necessary to extract the download link.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - Open the page [Delphinapterus leucas genome assembly ASM228892v3 - NCBI - NLM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_002288925.2/).\n\n2. **Select the GFF3 File Type**:\n   - Click on 'Download'.\n   - Select 'Annotation features (GFF)'.\n\n3. **Scroll to the 'Download Package' Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the 'Download Package' section.\n\n4. **Extract the Direct Download Link**:\n   - Explicitly extract the direct download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n5. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   - Check the metadata or release notes to confirm the release date of the GFF3 file.\n   - Ensure the file is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n6. **Provide the Link**:\n   - Return the direct download link to the user.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Be Explicit**: Clearly instruct WebSurfer to extract the direct download link once the correct file type is selected.\n- **Consistent Scrolling**: Ensure consistent scrolling to the 'Download Package' section to avoid missing the relevant content.\n- **Double-Check**: Verify the release date to ensure the file meets the specified requirements.\n- **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure each step is distinct and progresses towards the goal of finding and verifying the correct GFF3 file.\n\n### Instructions for WebSurfer\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - Open the page [Delphinapterus leucas genome assembly ASM228892v3 - NCBI - NLM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_002288925.2/).\n\n2. **Select the GFF3 File Type**:\n   - Click on 'Download'.\n   - Select 'Annotation features (GFF)'.\n\n3. **Scroll to the 'Download Package' Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the 'Download Package' section.\n\n4. **Extract the Direct Download Link**:\n   - Extract the direct download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n5. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   -

Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is looking for a GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n   - The file should be the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The NCBI database contains a genome assembly for the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) with the accession number GCF_002288925.2, submitted by the BC Cancer Agency on August 29, 2019.\n   - The NCBI Datasets page allows downloading various file types, including GFF3 files for annotation features.\n   - The NCBI Delphinapterus leucas Annotation Release 101 was released on September 6, 2019, and includes 27,561 genes and 18,469 protein-coding genes.\n   - The GFF3 file for the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2 is available for download from the NCBI Datasets page.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact date of the last update or release of the GFF3 file for the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2.\n   - Any more recent updates or releases of the GFF3 file after September 6, 2019, up to 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Verify if the GFF3 file for the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2 is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020 by checking the metadata or release notes.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file for the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2, which is part of the NCBI Delphinapterus leucas Annotation Release 101, is likely the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020, given that it was the latest submission found in the NCBI database.\n   - The GFF3 file can be downloaded from the NCBI Datasets page, but we need to confirm the exact release date to ensure it meets the requirement of being the most recent as of 20/10/2020.\n   - Other databases like Ensembl might also have the GFF3 file, but NCBI appears to be the primary source for this specific assembly.\n   - The release date of the GFF3 file (September 6, 2019) is earlier than 20/10/2020, but there are no indications of more recent updates, suggesting that this is the most recent version available.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The NCBI database is a trusted and comprehensive resource for genomic data, and the beluga whale genome assembly GCF_002288925.2 is the most recent one we have found so far.\n- Given the submission date of August 29, 2019, and the annotation release date of September 6, 2019, and the lack of more recent entries, it is reasonable to assume that this is the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n- Checking the metadata or release notes on the NCBI Datasets page will help confirm the exact release date and ensure the file meets the specified requirements.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Extract the Direct Download Link for the GFF3 File:**\n   - Scroll down to the 'Download Package' section.\n   - Ensure 'Annotation features (GFF)' is selected.\n   - Extract the direct download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n2. **Verify the Release Date:**\n   - Check the metadata or release notes to confirm the release date of the GFF3 file.\n   - Ensure the file is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **Provide the Link:**\n   - Return the direct download link to the user.\n\n### Instructions for WebSurfer\n\nPlease proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Scroll Down to the 'Download Package' Section:**\n   - Ensure 'Annotation features (GFF)' is selected.\n   - Extract the direct download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n2. **Check the Metadata or Release Notes:**\n   - Verify the release date of the GFF3 file.\n   - Ensure it is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **Return the Direct Download Link:**\n   - Provide the direct download link to the user.\n\n### Additional Note\n\n- If the metadata or release notes indicate that there are no more recent updates to the GFF3 file after September 6, 2019, then the GFF3 file from this release is indeed the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n- If there are any more recent updates, please provide the link to the most recent GFF3 file.\n\nThank you for your continued assistance!\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetition of Actions**: We repeatedly clicked on 'Annotation features (GFF)' without extracting the direct download link, leading to a loop of the same actions.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: We did not explicitly ask WebSurfer to extract the direct download link once the correct file type was selected.\n- **Insufficient Verification**: We did not verify the release date of the GFF3 file to ensure it was the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n- **Inconsistent Scrolling**: We did not consistently scroll to the 'Download Package' section, which is necessary to extract the download link.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - Open the page [Delphinapterus leucas genome assembly ASM228892v3 - NCBI - NLM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_002288925.2/).\n\n2. **Select the GFF3 File Type**:\n   - Click on 'Download'.\n   - Select 'Annotation features (GFF)'.\n\n3. **Scroll to the 'Download Package' Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the 'Download Package' section.\n\n4. **Extract the Direct Download Link**:\n   - Explicitly extract the direct download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n5. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   - Check the metadata or release notes to confirm the release date of the GFF3 file.\n   - Ensure the file is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n6. **Provide the Link**:\n   - Return the direct download link to the user.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Be Explicit**: Clearly instruct WebSurfer to extract the direct download link once the correct file type is selected.\n- **Consistent Scrolling**: Ensure consistent scrolling to the 'Download Package' section to avoid missing the relevant content.\n- **Double-Check**: Verify the release date to ensure the file meets the specified requirements.\n- **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure each step is distinct and progresses towards the goal of finding and verifying the correct GFF3 file.\n\n### Instructions for WebSurfer\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - Open the page [Delphinapterus leucas genome assembly ASM228892v3 - NCBI - NLM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_002288925.2/).\n\n2. **Select the GFF3 File Type**:\n   - Click on 'Download'.\n   - Select 'Annotation features (GFF)'.\n\n3. **Scroll to the 'Download Package' Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the 'Download Package' section.\n\n4. **Extract the Direct Download Link**:\n   - Explicitly extract the direct download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n5. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   - Check the metadata or release notes to confirm the release date of the GFF3 file.\n   - Ensure the file is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n6. **Provide the Link**:\n   - Return the direct download link to the user.\n\n### Additional Note\n\n- If the metadata or release notes indicate that there are no more recent updates to the GFF3 file after September 6, 2019, then the GFF3 file from this release is indeed the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n- If there are any more recent updates, please provide the link to the most recent GFF3 file."}
