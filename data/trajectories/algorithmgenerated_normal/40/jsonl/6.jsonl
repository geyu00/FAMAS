{"agent": "NumericalMethods_Expert", "content": "To solve the task using Newton's Method, we'll follow the outlined steps in the plan:\n\n1. Define the function \\( f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \\) and its derivative \\( f'(x) \\).\n2. Implement Newton's Method starting from the initial guess \\( x_0 = -5 \\).\n3. Continue iterating until the values converge to four decimal places.\n4. Record the smallest \\( n \\) at which convergence occurs.\n\nLet's implement this in Python. Here's the code to perform the calculations:\n\n```python\n# filename: newtons_method_convergence.py\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the function and its derivative\ndef f(x):\n    return x**3 + 4*x**2 - 3*x + 8\n\ndef f_prime(x):\n    return 3*x**2 + 8*x - 3\n\n# Newton's method implementation\ndef newtons_method(x0, tol=1e-4, max_iter=100):\n    x_n = x0\n    for n in range(max_iter):\n        x_n1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f_prime(x_n)  # Newton's update\n        # Check for convergence\n        if round(x_n1, 4) == round(x_n, 4):\n            return n + 1, round(x_n1, 4)  # Return n (1-indexed) and the value\n        x_n = x_n1\n    return None, None  # Return None if not converged\n\n# Initial value\nx0 = -5\n\n# Run Newton's method\nn, x_n_converged = newtons_method(x0)\nprint(n, x_n_converged)\n```\n\nThis code defines the function and its derivative, applies Newton's method, and prints the smallest \\( n \\) and the converged value after rounding to four decimal places.
