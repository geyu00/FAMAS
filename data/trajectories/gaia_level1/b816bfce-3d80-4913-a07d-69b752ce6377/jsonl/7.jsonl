{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expresses distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of the journal (which is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house).\n   - The specific word quoted from the two different authors.\n   - The exact context in which the word was used and the authors who used it.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house (likely from Norse mythology).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The journal is likely named after Fafnir, one of Hreidmar's sons who is known for transforming into a dragon in Norse mythology.\n   - The word in question might be related to common criticisms of dragon depictions, such as \"cliché,\" \"overdone,\" or \"unrealistic.\" However, this is speculative and needs verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Journal Name**: \n  - Use WebSurfer to search for information about Hreidmar's sons in Norse mythology to determine which son guarded his house.\n  - Once identified, search for the journal name that matches this son's name.\n\n- **Locate the Article**:\n  - Use WebSurfer to find Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the identified journal.\n  - Open the article and locate the section where the word expressing distaste for dragon depictions is mentioned.\n\n- **Extract the Word**:\n  - Identify the specific word quoted from two different authors.\n  - Note the context and the authors who used the word.\n\n- **Verify the Information**:\n  - Double-check the extracted information to ensure accuracy.\n  - If necessary, use WebSurfer to cross-reference the information with additional sources.\n\n- **Compile the Final Answer**:\n  - Summarize the findings, including the journal name, the word, and the authors who used it.\n  - Provide the final answer in a clear and concise format."}

He is featured in the \nVölsunga saga and in \nSnorri Sturluson's \nProse Edda.\n[1]Hreiðmarr was the father of \nRegin, \nFafnir, \nÓtr, Lyngheiðr and Lofnheiðr. He owned a house of glittering gold and flashing gems built by Regin and guarded by Fafnir. After Otr was accidentally killed by \nLoki, the \nÆsir repaid Hreiðmarr with \nAndvari's gold and the ring \nAndvaranaut, a magical ring that could create gold. However, Andvari had cursed the ring to bring misfortune and destruction to whoever else possessed it. Hreiðmarr ignored Loki's warnings about the curse and kept the ring, only to have Fafnir and Regin later kill him for it. Fafnir decided he wanted Andvaranaut for himself, so he turned into a \ndragon and drove Regin away. Fafnir guarded the treasure until \nSigurd, on Regin's instigation, arrived and delivered a fatal blow to the dragon. Regin was then also killed by Sigurd while attempting to murder him for the ring, thus leaving all of Hreiðmarr's family dead.\n[2][3]See also[edit]Völsung CycleReferences[edit]^ \nVolsunga Saga, with Excerpts from the Poetic Edda (translated by William Morris and Eirikr Magnusson)^ \nReginsmál (Heimskringla)^ \nThe Story Within the Story: Otter's Ransom (Wilfrid Laurier University) Archived 2015-02-14 at the Wayback MachineOther sources[edit]Byock, Jesse L.

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children’s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children’s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:large\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.\nKeywords: Dragon, uncanny, Freud, children’s literature\nBiography: Emily Midkiff (MA, English and Children’s Literature) is teaching and working on her PhD at the University of Minnesota.\nJ.R.R. Tolkien once declared that “the dragon in legend is a potent creation of men’s imagination, richer in significance than his barrow is in gold” (“The Monsters” 16). Dragons in mythology have come to be recognized for their value as representations of ancient cultures or as worldwide archetypes. Anthropologists have found and studied dragons in nearly all surviving mythologies; medievalists have examined them in manuscripts and bestiaries. In modern literature, dragons have flourished in their newer realm of fantasy and children’s literature as one of its most pervasive mythic animals.\nYet within children’s literature, scholars have noted a trend beginning even before the dragon’s mass popularity in fantasy to soften and satirize the dragon for children. While this type of friendly dragon has become a well known resident of children’s books, this article argues that children’s literature dragons have been not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children’s literature dragons.\nFluffy Dragons\nIn comparison to ancient dragon lore, modern dragons for children inspire less terror and more laughter, beginning most noticeably with Kenneth Grahame’s “The Reluctant Dragon” in 1898. Ruth Stein in 1968 and Margaret Blount in 1974 both comment with distaste on the increasingly cuddly, “fluffy” nature of dragons in children’s literature. In a short article for \nElementary Education, Stein expresses hope that Tolkien’s Smaug would improve the literary dragon’s evolution and encourage properly scary dragons. While this has since proved true in part, the bemoaned fluffy dragons remain prevalent alongside Tolkien’s menacing breed. Nonetheless Blount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they could be less than terrifying and still remain “real dragons” (129). She points out several stories that fail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally behave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in order to inspire conflict. Jon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a “real” dragon is and even praises the proliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame’s dragon, as parodies of the outdated cultural codes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223). Hope Shastri’s 1992 dissertation on the picture book dragon gives concrete results to support the observations of scholars like Stein, Blount, and Stott. Shastri performed a content analysis of 151 picture books produced between 1950 and 1992 in order to ascertain whether or not dragons have preserved their range of mythic capabilities in that form of children’s literature. She divides picture book dragons into three categories: Household (the type that Blount accused of failure), Wildwood (untamed, living in the wild and closer to Tolkien’s sort), and Imaginary (clearly pretend or a dream on the part of a child) and identifies thirty traditional dragon traits such as breathing fire, consuming humans, guarding treasure, talking, flying, and being vanquished. After applying these categories and traits to all 151 books, Shastri concludes that picture book dragons have effectively lost the majority of their original mythic qualities, save fire-breathing, and have largely become tame and meek—especially the Household dragons, out of which she finds 86% to be denatured as opposed to 34% of Wildwood and 42% of Imaginary dragons (77). Tina L. Hanlon generally agrees with Shastri’s findings in her own examination of 100 picture books in 2003, but she also notes with some hope the resurgence of strong dragons in retold fairy tales. In total, the work of these scholars over the past two decades indicates that dragons in children’s books are increasingly humorous and less and less fearsome, just as Stein feared when she wrote over forty years ago.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:large\",\n        \"generator\": \"WordPress 6.8.1\",\n        \"resource_type\": \"knowledgeblog\",\n        \"citation_journal_title\": \"\",\n        \"citation_publication_date\": \"2015/01/02\",\n        \"citation_date\": \"2015\",\n        \"citation_author\": \"Editor\",\n        \"citation_authors\": \"Editor, \",\n        \"citation_title\": \"\\u201cDragons are Tricksy\\u201d: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\\u2019s Literature\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"\",\n        \"og:title\": \"\\u201cDragons are Tricksy\\u201d: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\\u2019s Literature\",\n        \"og:type\": \"article\",\n        \"og:url\": \"http://journal.finfar.org/articles/dragons-are-tricksy-the-uncanny-dragons-of-childrens-literature/\",\n        \"og:author\": \"http://journal.finfar.org/?kblog-header-p=76&kblog-header-author=0\",\n        \"article:published_time\": \"2015-01-02\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Ruth Stein in 1968 and Margaret Blount in 1974 both comment with distaste on the increasingly cuddly, “fluffy” nature of dragons in children’s literature. In a short article for Elementary Education, Stein expresses hope that Tolkien’s Smaug would improve the literary dragon’s evolution and encourage properly scary dragons. While this has since proved true in part, the bemoaned fluffy dragons remain prevalent alongside Tolkien’s menacing breed. Nonetheless Blount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they could be less than terrifying and still remain “real dragons” (129). She points out several stories that fail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally behave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in order to inspire conflict. Jon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a “real” dragon is and even praises the proliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame’s dragon, as parodies of the outdated cultural codes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223).
