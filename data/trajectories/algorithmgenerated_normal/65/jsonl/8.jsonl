Since the task requires me to analyze a specific video within a blog post, I will summarize how to extract the needed information.\n\n1. I will need to access the 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com, find the last video, and watch it carefully.\n2. I will analyze the video for any commands that were clicked on to remove extra lines.\n\nHowever, I currently do not have direct access to websites or video content. If you could provide me with the video or relevant details about its content, I could help transcribe, analyze it, and extract the command you need.\n\nIf you can share the video, I can help you with the analysis or assist you in finding it."}

Otherwise, I recommend verifying the details in the blog post directly. Please let me know how you wish to proceed!"}
