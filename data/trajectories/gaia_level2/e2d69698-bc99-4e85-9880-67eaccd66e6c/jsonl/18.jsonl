Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking about the US version of Survivor.\n   - The request is asking for a winner born in the month of May.\n   - The request specifies the time frame as of August 2023.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of all winners of the US version of Survivor.\n   - The birth months of these winners.\n   - These facts can be found on official Survivor websites, Wikipedia pages dedicated to Survivor, and possibly fan sites that track such details.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the list of winners with their birth months to identify those born in May.\n   - Confirming that only one winner fits the criteria.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge of Survivor, it is known that the show has had several seasons and multiple winners, but without specific data, it's not possible to guess the exact winner born in May.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find a comprehensive list of all US Survivor winners.\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the official Survivor website or reliable fan sites to gather the birth months of the winners.\n- **Assistant**: Compile the list of winners and their birth months.\n- **Assistant**: Identify the winner(s) born in May.\n- **Assistant**: Verify that there is only one winner born in May as of August 2023.\n- **Assistant**: Present the final answer."}
