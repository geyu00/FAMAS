This typically translates to a distance of approximately 0.25 miles (400 meters).\n\n### Step 3: Verify Schedules\nNext, I need to verify the class schedules of the identified martial arts schools to ensure they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n\nLet me start by compiling a list of martial arts schools in the vicinity. After obtaining the schools, I will check their class schedules. \n\n### Search for Martial Arts Schools\nI will find the schools and their schedules next. Let's find the relevant information. \n\n```python\n# Assuming we have access to an API or a dataset that lists martial arts schools and their schedules\nimport requests\n\n# Function to get martial arts schools near the NYSE location\ndef get_martial_arts_schools(location):\n    # This is a mock API call to illustrate the idea\n    # In a real scenario, this function would call a location-based service.\n    response = requests.get(f\"https://api.example.com/martial_arts_schools?location={location}&radius=0.25\")\n    return response.json() if response.status_code == 200 else []\n\n# NYSE location\nlocation_nyse = \"11 Wall St, New York, NY 10005\"\nschools = get_martial_arts_schools(location_nyse)\nschools\n``` \n\nLet's run the above code to see what martial arts schools we can find near the NYSE. Please execute this code in the Computer_terminal."}
