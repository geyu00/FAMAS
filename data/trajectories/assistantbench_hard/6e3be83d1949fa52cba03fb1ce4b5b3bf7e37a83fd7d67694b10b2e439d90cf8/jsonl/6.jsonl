{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user is looking for martial arts classes.\n   - The location is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time frame for the classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n   - The Academy of Integrated Martial Systems is located at 30 Broad Street, 6th Floor, New York City, 10004, and offers classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific martial arts studios or gyms within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - Class schedules for these studios, particularly evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - These details can be found on the websites of local martial arts schools, Google Maps, or local business directories like Yelp or Yellow Pages.\n   - Verify the exact class times for the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems to see if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange to potential martial arts studios.\n   - Whether the class times at the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems align with the user's specified time frame of 7-9 pm.\n   - Check if other nearby studios offer classes during the desired time frame.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely several fitness and martial arts studios in the Financial District area of New York City, given its high density of businesses and residents.\n   - Popular martial arts styles such as Karate, Taekwondo, Jiu-Jitsu, and Muay Thai are likely to be offered in the area.\n   - Some studios may offer flexible class times to accommodate working professionals.\n   - The Academy of Integrated Martial Systems is a strong candidate, as it is located very close to the New York Stock Exchange and offers evening classes, though we need to confirm the specific times.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Proximity and Class Times:** The Academy of Integrated Martial Systems is a strong candidate because it is located at 30 Broad Street, which is very close to the New York Stock Exchange. The studio's operating hours (4:00 PM to 8:00 PM on certain days) suggest that they cater to working professionals, but we need to confirm if they have classes specifically between 7-9 pm.\n- **Other Studios:** Given the high density of businesses and residents in the Financial District, it is reasonable to assume that there are other martial arts studios nearby. We should continue to look for additional options to provide the user with a comprehensive list.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Lack of Direct Navigation to Class Schedules:**\n   - We did not directly navigate to the 'Classes' or 'Schedule' sections on the websites of the identified martial arts studios, which contain the specific class times.\n   \n2. **Inefficient Scrolling and Searching:**\n   - We relied too heavily on manual scrolling and did not use search functionalities or direct links to quickly find the relevant information.\n\n3. **Insufficient Verification:**\n   - We did not verify the exact walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified studios, which is crucial to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Identify Potential Martial Arts Studios**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"martial arts classes near New York Stock Exchange\" and use Google Maps to find studios within a five-minute walking distance.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the names and addresses of these studios.\n\n2. **Directly Navigate to Class Schedules**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified studio, directly navigate to the 'Classes' or 'Schedule' section of their website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search function on the website to quickly find the class schedules.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the class times, especially those between 7-9 pm.\n\n3. **Verify Walking Distances**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to verify the walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to each identified studio.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the distances are within a five-minute walk.\n\n4. **Summarize Findings**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the information gathered by WebSurfer into a clear and concise summary.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the user with a list of suitable martial arts studios, including their addresses, class times, and walking distances.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Identify Potential Martial Arts Studios**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"martial arts classes near New York Stock Exchange\" and use Google Maps to find studios within a five-minute walking distance.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the names and addresses of the following studios:\n     - Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\n     - Systema New York City\n     - Modern Martial Arts Tribeca\n     - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street\n\n2. **Directly Navigate to Class Schedules**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems:\n     - Go to the website: [https://aimsmartialarts.com/]\n     - Navigate to the 'Classes' or 'Schedule' section.\n     - Use the search function to find class times between 7-9 pm.\n     - Note down the class times.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Repeat the above steps for Systema New York City, Modern Martial Arts Tribeca, and Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street.\n\n3. **Verify Walking Distances**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to verify the walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to each studio.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the distances are within a five-minute walk and note them down.\n\n4. **Summarize Findings**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the information into a clear and concise summary.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the user with a list of suitable martial arts studios, including:\n     - Name\n     - Address\n     - Class times (specifically between 7-9 pm)\n     - Walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange\n\nBy following this new plan, we will ensure that we directly navigate to the relevant sections of the websites, verify the walking distances, and provide the user with accurate and useful information."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user is looking for martial arts classes.\n   - The location is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time frame for the classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n   - The Academy of Integrated Martial Systems is located at 30 Broad Street, 6th Floor, New York City, 10004, and offers classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM.\n   - Modern Martial Arts Tribeca is located at 78 Reade Street, NY, NY 10007.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific martial arts studios or gyms within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - Class schedules for these studios, particularly evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - These details can be found on the websites of local martial arts schools, Google Maps, or local business directories like Yelp or Yellow Pages.\n   - Verify the exact class times for the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems to see if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - Verify the exact class times for Modern Martial Arts Tribeca to see if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - Verify the exact walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to both the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems and Modern Martial Arts Tribeca.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange to potential martial arts studios.\n   - Whether the class times at the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems and Modern Martial Arts Tribeca align with the user's specified time frame of 7-9 pm.\n   - Check if other nearby studios offer classes during the desired time frame.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely several fitness and martial arts studios in the Financial District area of New York City, given its high density of businesses and residents.\n   - Popular martial arts styles such as Karate, Taekwondo, Jiu-Jitsu, and Muay Thai are likely to be offered in the area.\n   - Some studios may offer flexible class times to accommodate working professionals.\n   - The Academy of Integrated Martial Systems is a strong candidate, as it is located very close to the New York Stock Exchange and offers evening classes, though we need to confirm the specific times.\n   - Modern Martial Arts Tribeca is another strong candidate due to its proximity to the New York Stock Exchange and its reputation for offering a variety of martial arts classes.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Proximity and Class Times:** The Academy of Integrated Martial Systems and Modern Martial Arts Tribeca are both strong candidates because they are located very close to the New York Stock Exchange. The operating hours of the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems (4:00 PM to 8:00 PM on certain days) suggest that they cater to working professionals, but we need to confirm if they have classes specifically between 7-9 pm.\n- **Other Studios:** Given the high density of businesses and residents in the Financial District, it is reasonable to assume that there are other martial arts studios nearby. We should continue to look for additional options to provide the user with a comprehensive list.\n- **Modern Martial Arts Tribeca:** This studio is likely to offer a variety of classes, including some in the evening, which makes it a strong candidate for the user's needs.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Verify Class Times for the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Classes' or 'Schedule' section of the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems website to confirm if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the class times.\n\n2. **Verify Class Times for Modern Martial Arts Tribeca**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the 'Schedule' section of the Modern Martial Arts Tribeca website to find the class times between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the class times.\n\n3. **Verify Walking Distances**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to verify the walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to both the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems and Modern Martial Arts Tribeca.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the distances are within a five-minute walk and note them down.\n\n4. **Summarize Findings**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the information gathered by WebSurfer into a clear and concise summary.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the user with a list of suitable martial arts studios, including their addresses, class times, and walking distances.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to gather the necessary information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues:**\n   - We encountered difficulties navigating directly to the 'Schedule' sections of the websites, leading to repeated clicks and scrolls without reaching the desired information.\n   - The web surfer did not effectively use the search functionality or direct links to quickly find the class schedules.\n\n2. **Inefficient Information Gathering:**\n   - We did not systematically note down the class times and walking distances as we progressed, leading to incomplete data collection.\n   - The web surfer sometimes got stuck on irrelevant sections of the websites, such as 'Birthday Parties' or 'Locations,' instead of focusing on the class schedules.\n\n3. **Lack of Verification:**\n   - We did not consistently verify the walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified studios, which is crucial to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Identify Potential Martial Arts Studios**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"martial arts classes near New York Stock Exchange\" and use Google Maps to find studios within a five-minute walking distance.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the names and addresses of the following studios:\n     -

But you, the martial artist must constantly be moving, changing, and evolving yourself through the application of the progressions and techniques passed down through the ages so that you are continuously chasing the unattainable idea of perfection.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@graph\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Place\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#place\",\n                \"address\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"PostalAddress\",\n                    \"streetAddress\": \"30 Broad Street\",\n                    \"addressLocality\": \"New York\",\n                    \"addressRegion\": \"New York\",\n                    \"postalCode\": \"10004\",\n                    \"addressCountry\": \"USA\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": [\n                    \"LocalBusiness\",\n                    \"Organization\"\n                ],\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#organization\",\n                \"name\": \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com\",\n                \"address\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"PostalAddress\",\n                    \"streetAddress\": \"30 Broad Street\",\n                    \"addressLocality\": \"New York\",\n                    \"addressRegion\": \"New York\",\n                    \"postalCode\": \"10004\",\n                    \"addressCountry\": \"USA\"\n                },\n                \"logo\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#logo\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cropped-Aims-chest-white-1.png\",\n                    \"contentUrl\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cropped-Aims-chest-white-1.png\",\n                    \"caption\": \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\",\n                    \"inLanguage\": \"en-US\",\n                    \"width\": \"512\",\n                    \"height\": \"512\"\n                },\n                \"openingHours\": [\n                    \"Monday,Wednesday,Friday 16:00-20:00\"\n                ],\n                \"location\": {\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#place\"\n                },\n                \"image\": {\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#logo\"\n                },\n                \"telephone\": \"+1-231-391-3511\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"WebSite\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#website\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com\",\n                \"name\": \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\",\n                \"alternateName\": \"AIMS\",\n                \"publisher\": {\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#organization\"\n                },\n                \"inLanguage\": \"en-US\",\n                \"potentialAction\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"SearchAction\",\n                    \"target\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/?s={search_term_string}\",\n                    \"query-input\": \"required name=search_term_string\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/aimslogo.svg\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/aimslogo.svg\",\n                \"width\": \"200\",\n                \"height\": \"200\",\n                \"inLanguage\": \"en-US\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#webpage\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/\",\n                \"name\": \"AIMS Martial Arts -

Martial arts is something that you become– it must be a lifestyle that comes to life through a process of training, which forces you (the martial artist) to evolve your thinking, imagination, and creativity.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user is looking for martial arts classes.\n   - The location is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time frame for the classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n   - The Academy of Integrated Martial Systems is located at 30 Broad Street, 6th Floor, New York City, 10004, and offers classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM.\n   - Modern Martial Arts Tribeca is located at 78 Reade Street, NY, NY 10007.\n\n#### 2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific martial arts studios or gyms within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - Class schedules for these studios, particularly evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - These details can be found on the websites of local martial arts schools, Google Maps, or local business directories like Yelp or Yellow Pages.\n   - Verify the exact class times for the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems to see if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - Verify the exact class times for Modern Martial Arts Tribeca to see if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - Verify the exact walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to both the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems and Modern Martial Arts Tribeca.\n\n#### 3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange to potential martial arts studios.\n   - Whether the class times at the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems and Modern Martial Arts Tribeca align with the user's specified time frame of 7-9 pm.\n   - Check if other nearby studios offer classes during the desired time frame.\n\n#### 4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely several fitness and martial arts studios in the Financial District area of New York City, given its high density of businesses and residents.\n   - Popular martial arts styles such as Karate, Taekwondo, Jiu-Jitsu, and Muay Thai are likely to be offered in the area.\n   - Some studios may offer flexible class times to accommodate working professionals.\n   - The Academy of Integrated Martial Systems is a strong candidate, as it is located very close to the New York Stock Exchange and offers evening classes, though we need to confirm the specific times.\n   - Modern Martial Arts Tribeca is another strong candidate due to its proximity to the New York Stock Exchange and its reputation for offering a variety of martial arts classes.\n   - Other potential studios in the area might include:\n     - Systema New York City\n     - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street\n   - These additional studios are likely to have evening classes and may also be within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Proximity and Class Times:** The Academy of Integrated Martial Systems and Modern Martial Arts Tribeca are both strong candidates because they are located very close to the New York Stock Exchange. The operating hours of the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems (4:00 PM to 8:00 PM on certain days) suggest that they cater to working professionals, but we need to confirm if they have classes specifically between 7-9 pm.\n- **Other Studios:** Given the high density of businesses and residents in the Financial District, it is reasonable to assume that there are other martial arts studios nearby. We should continue to look for additional options to provide the user with a comprehensive list.\n- **Modern Martial Arts Tribeca:** This studio is likely to offer a variety of classes, including some in the evening, which makes it a strong candidate for the user's needs.\n- **Additional Studios:** Including Systema New York City and Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street in our search can provide more options and increase the likelihood of finding a suitable class.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Verify Class Times for the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Classes' or 'Schedule' section of the Academy of Integrated Martial Systems website to confirm if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the class times.\n\n2. **Verify Class Times for Modern Martial Arts Tribeca**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the 'Schedule' section of the Modern Martial Arts Tribeca website to find the class times between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the class times.\n\n3. **Verify Class Times for Systema New York City**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Classes' or 'Schedule' section of the Systema New York City website to find the class times between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the class times.\n\n4. **Verify Class Times for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Classes' or 'Schedule' section of the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website to find the class times between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the class times.\n\n5. **Verify Walking Distances**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to verify the walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to all identified studios.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the distances are within a five-minute walk and note them down.\n\n6. **Summarize Findings**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the information gathered by WebSurfer into a clear and concise summary.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the user with a list of suitable martial arts studios, including their addresses, class times, and walking distances.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to gather the necessary information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues:**\n   - We encountered difficulties navigating directly to the 'Schedule' sections of the websites, leading to repeated clicks and scrolls without reaching the desired information.\n   - The web surfer did not effectively use the search functionality or direct links to quickly find the class schedules.\n\n2. **Inefficient Information Gathering:**\n   - We did not systematically note down the class times and walking distances as we progressed, leading to incomplete data collection.\n   - The web surfer sometimes got stuck on irrelevant sections of the websites, such as 'Birthday Parties' or 'Locations,' instead of focusing on the class schedules.\n\n3. **Lack of Verification:**\n   - We did not consistently verify the walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified studios, which is crucial to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Identify Potential Martial Arts Studios**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"martial arts classes near New York Stock Exchange\" and use Google Maps to find studios within a five-minute walking distance.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the names and addresses of the following studios:\n     -

**WebSurfer**: Ensure the distances are within a five-minute walk and note them down.\n\n4. **Summarize Findings**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the information gathered by WebSurfer into a clear and concise summary.\n   -

Martial arts is something that you become– it must be a lifestyle that comes to life through a process of training, which forces you (the martial artist) to evolve your thinking, imagination, and creativity. The techniques and progressions that you learn that make you into a martial artist do not change– they are forever still in the current of time. But you, the martial artist must constantly be moving, changing, and evolving yourself through the application of the progressions and techniques passed down through the ages so that you are continuously chasing the unattainable idea of perfection.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@graph\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Place\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#place\",\n                \"address\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"PostalAddress\",\n                    \"streetAddress\": \"30 Broad Street\",\n                    \"addressLocality\": \"New York\",\n                    \"addressRegion\": \"New York\",\n                    \"postalCode\": \"10004\",\n                    \"addressCountry\": \"USA\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": [\n                    \"LocalBusiness\",\n                    \"Organization\"\n                ],\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#organization\",\n                \"name\": \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com\",\n                \"address\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"PostalAddress\",\n                    \"streetAddress\": \"30 Broad Street\",\n                    \"addressLocality\": \"New York\",\n                    \"addressRegion\": \"New York\",\n                    \"postalCode\": \"10004\",\n                    \"addressCountry\": \"USA\"\n                },\n                \"logo\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#logo\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cropped-Aims-chest-white-1.png\",\n                    \"contentUrl\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cropped-Aims-chest-white-1.png\",\n                    \"caption\": \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\",\n                    \"inLanguage\": \"en-US\",\n                    \"width\": \"512\",\n                    \"height\": \"512\"\n                },\n                \"openingHours\": [\n                    \"Monday,Wednesday,Friday 16:00-20:00\"\n                ],\n                \"location\": {\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#place\"\n                },\n                \"image\": {\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#logo\"\n                },\n                \"telephone\": \"+1-231-391-3511\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"WebSite\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#website\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com\",\n                \"name\": \"Academy of Integrated Martial Systems\",\n                \"alternateName\": \"AIMS\",\n                \"publisher\": {\n                    \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#organization\"\n                },\n                \"inLanguage\": \"en-US\",\n                \"potentialAction\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"SearchAction\",\n                    \"target\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/?s={search_term_string}\",\n                    \"query-input\": \"required name=search_term_string\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/aimslogo.svg\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/aimslogo.svg\",\n                \"width\": \"200\",\n                \"height\": \"200\",\n                \"inLanguage\": \"en-US\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n                \"@id\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/#webpage\",\n                \"url\": \"https://aimsmartialarts.com/\",\n                \"name\": \"AIMS Martial Arts -
