{"agent": "VideoContentAnalysis_Expert", "content": "The execution of the video download command failed due to an issue with YouTube's API, which often requires proper authentication to access certain content, especially if it suspects that the request is automated.\n\nTo move forward, I will suggest two approaches: \n\n1. **Updating `yt-dlp` and Python**: The warning message indicates that the version of Python being used is outdated. Updating Python to 3.8 or above could resolve some of the issues.\n\n2. **Using an alternative method**: If updating doesn't help, we can try using a different approach by directly using `ffmpeg` with an alternate method or URL.\n\nFor now, let's update `yt-dlp` to the latest version. Here’s the command for that:\n\n```sh\n# filename: update_yt_dlp.sh\npip install --upgrade yt-dlp\n```\n\nPlease execute this command to ensure that `yt-dlp` is updated to the latest version.
