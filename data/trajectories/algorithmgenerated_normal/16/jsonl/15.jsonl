Specifically, I will look for videos uploaded in March 2018 and filter those with the Gollum voice actor as the narrator. The voice actor is Andy Serkis.\n\nI'll execute a search query to find the correct video. Let's prepare the code for this. \n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef search_youtube_video(api_key, query):\n    search_url = \"https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search\"\n    params = {\n        \"part\": \"snippet\",\n        \"q\": query,\n        \"type\": \"video\",\n        \"publishedAfter\": \"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\n        \"publishedBefore\": \"2018-03-31T23:59:59Z\",\n        \"key\": api_key\n    }\n    response = requests.get(search_url, params=params)\n    return response.json()\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with the actual API key for YouTube Data API\napi_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\nquery = \"Gollum Andy Serkis 360 VR\"\nvideo_results = search_youtube_video(api_key, query)\nprint(video_results)\n```\n\nI'll run this code to search for the video on YouTube.
