It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The time frame of interest is 2020-2023.\n   - The location of interest is Houston, Texas.\n   - The month of interest is June.\n   - The temperature threshold is 95°F (Fahrenheit).\n   - The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and the National Weather Service (NWS) are reliable sources for historical weather data.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical weather data for Houston, Texas, specifically daily maximum temperatures for June in the years 2020-2023.\n   - These data can be found on authoritative weather websites such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Weather Service (NWS), or local weather stations' archives.\n   - The specific dataset for Houston, Texas, is available from the GHCND (Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily) dataset.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days in June (for each year 2020-2023) where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n   - The total number of days in June across the four years (2020-2023).\n   - The percentage of days in June (2020-2023) where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge of Houston's climate, it is reasonable to expect that a significant portion of June days may exceed 95°F, given Houston's hot and humid subtropical climate. However, without specific data, this is just an educated guess.\n   - The GHCND dataset is likely to provide the most accurate and detailed historical weather data for Houston, Texas. This dataset should be the primary source for extracting the required temperature data.\n   - The process of extracting and analyzing the data might involve multiple steps, including selecting the correct station (HOUSTON NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE OFFICE, TX US), specifying the date range, and downloading the data in a usable format (e.g., CSV).\n\n**ADDITIONAL HUNCHES AND REASONING**\n- **Data Extraction Challenges**: The current process of navigating the NCEI website and selecting the correct data parameters might be more complex than initially anticipated. It may be necessary to explore alternative methods or tools for extracting the data, such as using the NCEI API or contacting their customer support for assistance.\n- **Data Consistency**: Given the high data coverage (99%) mentioned on the NCEI website, it is likely that the data for the specified period is complete and reliable. This increases the confidence in the accuracy of the final percentage calculation.\n- **Alternative Sources**: If the NCEI website continues to pose challenges, other reliable sources like the National Weather Service (NWS) or local weather stations' archives should be considered as backup options.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step, which involves navigating to the correct section on the NCEI website to extract the daily maximum temperatures for June in the years 2020-2023. If the current method is not yielding results, we will explore alternative approaches.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Navigation and Interaction Issues**: The WebSurfer was unable to successfully navigate to the correct section of the NCEI website to extract the required data. Despite selecting the year and month, the \"View Data\" button was not clicked, and the data extraction process did not proceed.\n- **Lack of Clear Instructions**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were not specific enough to ensure that all necessary steps were followed in the correct sequence.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the NCEI website and navigate to the \"Daily Summaries Station Details\" page for Houston, Texas (HOUSTON NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE OFFICE, TX US, GHCND:USC00414333).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the page is fully loaded.\n\n2. **Select the Year and Month**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Select the year 2020 from the \"Select a year\" dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Select June from the \"Select a month\" dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click the \"View Data\" button.\n\n3. **Repeat for Other Years**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Repeat the above steps for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023, ensuring the \"View Data\" button is clicked each time.\n\n4. **Extract and Save Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the data is displayed, extract the daily maximum temperatures for June in each of the years 2020-2023.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Save the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or text file).\n\n5. **Organize and Analyze Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Organize the extracted data into a structured format (e.g., a list or table).\n   - **Assistant**: Count the number of days in June (for each year 2020-2023) where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n   - **Assistant**: Calculate the total number of days in June across the four years (2020-2023).\n   - **Assistant**: Compute the percentage of days in June (2020-2023) where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n6. **Present the Final Percentage**:\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final percentage to the user.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the NCEI website and navigate to the \"Daily Summaries Station Details\" page for Houston, Texas (HOUSTON NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE OFFICE, TX US, GHCND:USC00414333).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the page is fully loaded.\n\n2. **Select the Year and Month**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Select the year 2020 from the \"Select a year\" dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Select June from the \"Select a month\" dropdown.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click the \"View Data\" button.\n\n3. **Extract Data for 2020**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the data is displayed, extract the daily maximum temperatures for June 2020.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Save the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or text file).\n\n4. **Repeat for Other Years**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Repeat the above steps for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023, ensuring the \"View Data\" button is clicked each time.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Save the extracted data for each year in a structured format.\n\n5. **Organize and Analyze Data**:\n   -

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nBased on recent years (2020-2023), how likely am I to hit a day with a max temperature (in Fahrenheit) over 95 if I travel to Houston, Texas during June? (provide the answer in percentage)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n- The time frame of interest is 2020-2023.\n- The location of interest is Houston, Texas.\n- The month of interest is June.\n- The temperature threshold is 95°F (Fahrenheit).\n- The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and the National Weather Service (NWS) are reliable sources for historical weather data.\n- The specific dataset for Houston, Texas, is available from the GHCND (Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily) dataset.\n\n#### 2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n- Historical weather data for Houston, Texas, specifically daily maximum temperatures for June in the years 2020-2023.\n- These data can be found on authoritative weather websites such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Weather Service (NWS), or local weather stations' archives.\n- The specific station of interest is HOUSTON WILLIAM P HOBBY AIRPORT, TX US (GHCND:USW00012918).\n\n#### 3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n- The number of days in June (for each year 2020-2023) where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n- The total number of days in June across the four years (2020-2023).\n- The percentage of days in June (2020-2023) where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n#### 4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n- Based on general knowledge of Houston's climate, it is reasonable to expect that a significant portion of June days may exceed 95°F, given Houston's hot and humid subtropical climate. However, without specific data, this is just an educated guess.\n- The GHCND dataset is likely to provide the most accurate and detailed historical weather data for Houston, Texas. This dataset should be the primary source for extracting the required temperature data.\n- The process of extracting and analyzing the data might involve multiple steps, including selecting the correct station (HOUSTON WILLIAM P HOBBY AIRPORT, TX US), specifying the date range, and downloading the data in a usable format (e.g., CSV).\n\n#### ADDITIONAL HUNCHES AND REASONING\n- **Data Extraction Challenges**: The current process of navigating the NCEI website and selecting the correct data parameters might be more complex than initially anticipated. It may be necessary to explore alternative methods or tools for extracting the data, such as using the NCEI API or contacting their customer support for assistance.\n- **Data Consistency**: Given the high data coverage (99%) mentioned on the NCEI website, it is likely that the data for the specified period is complete and reliable. This increases the confidence in the accuracy of the final percentage calculation.\n- **Alternative Sources**: If the NCEI website continues to pose challenges, other reliable sources like the National Weather Service (NWS) or local weather stations' archives should be considered as backup options.\n- **API Usage**: Using the NCEI API might be a more efficient and reliable way to extract the required data. The API can be accessed programmatically, which can automate the data retrieval process and reduce the risk of human error.\n- **Manual Extraction**: If the API approach is not feasible, manually downloading the data for each year and month and combining it into a single dataset might be necessary. This can be done by navigating to the NWS or NCEI websites and downloading the daily summary data for June 2020-2023.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the NCEI API Documentation**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the NCEI API documentation page and locate the section for accessing daily summary data.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Follow the instructions to set up API access and retrieve the daily maximum temperatures for Houston, Texas, for June 2020-2023.\n\n2. **Manual Data Extraction**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the API approach is not feasible, navigate to the NWS or NCEI websites and download the daily summary data for June 2020-2023.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Save the downloaded data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or text file).\n\n3. **Organize and Analyze Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Combine the extracted data from all four years into a single structured format.\n   - **Assistant**: Count the number of days in June (for each year 2020-2023) where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n   - **Assistant**: Calculate the total number of days in June across the four years (2020-2023).\n   - **Assistant**: Compute the percentage of days in June (2020-2023) where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n4. **Present the Final Percentage**:\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final percentage to the user.\n\n### Example Script for API Access\n```python\nimport requests\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# NCEI API endpoint\nbase_url = \"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/data\"\n\n# API key (you need to obtain this from NCEI)\napi_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\n# Parameters for the API request\nparams = {\n    \"datasetid\": \"GHCND\",\n    \"stationid\": \"GHCND:USW00012918\",\n    \"startdate\": \"2020-06-01\",\n    \"enddate\": \"2023-06-30\",\n    \"datatypeid\": \"TMAX\",\n    \"units\": \"standard\",\n    \"limit\": 1000\n}\n\n# Headers for the API request\nheaders = {\n    \"token\": api_key\n}\n\n# Make the API request\nresponse = requests.get(base_url, params=params, headers=headers)\n\n# Check if the request was successful\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = response.json()\n    # Convert the data to a DataFrame\n    df = pd.DataFrame(data['results'])\n    # Convert the date string to datetime\n    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])\n    # Filter for June\n    df_june = df[df['date'].dt.month == 6]\n    # Convert temperature from tenths of degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit\n    df_june['value'] = (df_june['value'] / 10) * 9/5 + 32\n    # Count the number of days where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F\n    hot_days = df_june[df_june['value'] > 95]\n    total_days = len(df_june)\n    percentage_hot_days = (len(hot_days) / total_days) * 100\n    print(f\"The percentage of days in June (2020-2023) where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F is {percentage_hot_days:.2f}%\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Failed to retrieve data: {response.status_code}\")\n```\n\nThis updated fact sheet and plan should help us efficiently extract and analyze the required data to answer the user's question.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: The WebSurfer navigated to a general climate page instead of the specific monthly/daily climate data page for Houston, Texas.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: The search terms used were too broad, leading to irrelevant results.\n- **Manual Extraction Challenges**: The manual extraction process was not clearly defined, leading to confusion and inefficiency.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the NCEI website and navigate to the \"Daily Summaries Station Details\" page for Houston, Texas (HOUSTON WILLIAM P HOBBY AIRPORT, TX US, GHCND:USW00012918).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the page is fully loaded.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Each Year**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each year (2020-2023):\n     - Select the year from the \"Select a year\" dropdown.\n     - Select June from the \"Select a month\" dropdown.\n     - Click the \"View Data\" button.\n     - Extract the daily maximum temperatures for June.\n     - Save the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or text file).\n\n3. **Combine and Analyze Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Combine the extracted data from all four years into a single structured format.\n   - **Assistant**: Count the number of days in June (for each year 2020-2023) where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n   - **Assistant**: Calculate the total number of days in June across the four years (2020-2023).\n   - **Assistant**: Compute the percentage of days in June (2020-2023) where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n\n4. **Present the Final Percentage**:\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final percentage to the user.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   -

Depending on the dataset the API can format the data as comma-separated values (\nCSV), space-separated values (SSV), JavaScript Object Notation (\nJSON), Portable Document Format (\nPDF) and Network Common Data Form (\nNetCDF). The NCEI Access Data Service is only available via HTTP Strict Transport Security (\nHSTS) following \nFederal government policy.\nRequest Endpoint\nThe NCEI Access Data Service queries use HTTP 1.1 \nGET request and the endpoint is located off the base URL at \n.../access/services/data/v1.\nRequest Endpoint Parameters\nThe NCEI Access Data Service endpoint allows several parameters to select and retrieve data from available datasets. The request parameters are passed using a GET request. Some of these request parameters change based on the dataset parameter that is passed.\nHelp improve this site\n NCEI Customer Experience Feedback \nThis survey is designed to measure your level of satisfaction with \nncei.noaa.gov.
