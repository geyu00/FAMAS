{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must star Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of movies starring Daniel Craig.\n   - The IMDB ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The availability of each of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which of Daniel Craig's movies meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability).\n   - The highest-rated movie among those that meet all the criteria.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, \"Skyfall\" and \"No Time to Die\" are highly rated and are part of the James Bond series, which often has shorter runtimes. However, their current availability on Netflix (US) is unknown.\n   - \"Casino Royale\" is another highly rated film starring Daniel Craig, but its runtime and current Netflix availability are also unknown.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the list of Daniel Craig movies**:\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for a comprehensive list of movies starring Daniel Craig.\n\n- **Check IMDB ratings and runtimes**:\n  - Use WebSurfer to visit IMDB and gather the ratings and runtimes for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n\n- **Filter movies by runtime**:\n  - Use Assistant to filter out movies that are 150 minutes or longer.\n\n- **Check Netflix (US) availability**:\n  - Use WebSurfer to check the availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n\n- **Determine the highest-rated movie**:\n  - Use Assistant to compare the IMDB ratings of the remaining movies and identify the highest-rated one.\n\n- **Verify and present the final result**:\n  - Use Assistant to verify the final result and present it clearly."}

Casino Royale (8.0) You only get one chance to make an impression. Luckily for Craig, his first go-around as the dashing super-spy James \"007\" Bond remains his most beloved movie of all, according to IMDB voters.\n2. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (7.8/10) During the height of his reign as James Bond, Craig wisely took time out of his busy schedule to work with David Fincher on the English-language adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n3. Skyfall (7.7/10) It's interesting to note how only half of Craig's Bond films have made this Top 10, yet both rank among the Top 3. The deduction? People either love or hate it when Craig plays 007, there's very little middle ground.\n4. Road To Perdition (7.7/10) In 2002, Craig hit the big-leagues by starring opposite cinematic heavyweights Paul Newman and Tom Hanks in the superb period gangster drama, Road To Perdition.\n5. Munich (7.5/10) At the time, Steven Spielberg's Munich was hailed for its performances by seemingly unknown actors. Since then, however, names like Eric Bana and Daniel Craig have become all but househlold items.\n2:21\nDaniel Craig: The Man Who Rebuilt James BondYouTube271 viewsDaniel Craig - IMDb\nDaniel \nCraig.

The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2012) His turn as Mikael Blomkovist totally blew my mind and exceeded expectations. Everything he did as Mikael seemed so effortless and brutally sincere.\n2.
