{"agent": "VSCode_Expert", "content": "As a VSCode expert, I won't be able to access external content or watch videos directly either. However, I can suggest how to proceed with using Visual Studio Code to remove extra lines efficiently.\n\nOnce you identify the command used in the video, you might find that using the \"Remove Empty Lines\" command can also be beneficial. Here are some common commands and shortcuts that you might want to consider in VSCode to remove extra lines:\n\n1. **Using Command Palette**: You can use the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and then type `Remove Empty Lines` if there is an extension installed for that functionality.\n  \n2. **Using Regex Replace**: You can open the Find and Replace dialog (`Ctrl + H` or `Cmd + H` on macOS) and use a regular expression to remove extra lines. In the \"Find\" box, input `^\\s*\\n` to find blank lines and replace them with nothing.\n\nIf you manage to watch the video and find the exact command, please share it here for further discussion or verification!"}
