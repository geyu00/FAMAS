Then, I will locate the specific nomination page for the identified article to find out who nominated it.\n\nI will start by searching for the Featured Articles promoted in November 2016 on Wikipedia, specifically looking for those related to dinosaurs. \n\nLet's retrieve the relevant information. \n\n### Step 1: Identify Dinosaur Featured Articles promoted in November 2016\n\nI will search for the history of featured article promotions in November 2016 focusing on dinosaur articles. \n\nI'll summarize the process:\n\n1. Navigate to the list of Featured Articles on Wikipedia.\n2. Filter the list by the date of promotion to identify those in November 2016.\n3. Narrow the results down to those pertaining to dinosaurs.\n\nI'll get started on this now. \n\n### Execution Code:\nLet's find out the specific articles promoted in November 2016.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Wikipedia URL for Featured Articles\nurl = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles/By_quality#November_2016'\n\n# Fetch the page content\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Extract the articles promoted in November 2016\narticles = []\nfor row in soup.select('table.wikitable tbody tr'):\n    date_cell = row.select_one('td:nth-child(1)')\n    title_cell = row.select_one('td:nth-child(2)')\n    if date_cell and title_cell:\n        date = date_cell.text.strip()\n        title = title_cell.text.strip()\n        if date.startswith('November'):\n            articles.append(title)\n\n# Filter only dinosaur related articles\ndinosaur_articles = [title for title in articles if 'dinosaur' in title.lower()]\ndinosaur_articles\n```\n\nNow, I will execute the code in the Computer_terminal to extract the dinosaur articles promoted in November 2016."}
