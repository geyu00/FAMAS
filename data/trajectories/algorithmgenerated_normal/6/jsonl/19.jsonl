{"agent": "NorseMythology_Expert", "content": "To begin, let's confirm the journal name \"Fafnir\" based on Hreidmar's sons.\n\nHreidmar was a character from Norse mythology, and his sons, including Fafnir, are significant figures. Fafnir is best known for transforming into a dragon due to his greed for gold. The journal \"Fafnir\" aptly refers to one of Hreidmar's sons, which helps to validate the journal's name in relation to Norse mythology.\n\nNow, let's proceed to the next step, which is to locate Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the journal \"Fafnir.\" \n\nI'll summarize the process of verifying the article and the quoted word, considering that the word must be relevant to the nature of dragon depictions and quoted from two different authors.\n\n1. **Locate the article**: I would check the journal archives of \"Fafnir\" for the specific issue from June 2014 to access the article by Emily Midkiff.\n2. **Analyze the content**: Upon finding the article, I will look for instances where two different authors are quoted concerning the nature of dragon depictions.\n3. **Extract the word**: Identify and confirm that the word meets the criteria of being quoted from two different authors.\n\nIf the Computer_terminal can assist, we could check for archives or databases where the journal might be available. Shall I proceed with code to assist in locating the article?"}
