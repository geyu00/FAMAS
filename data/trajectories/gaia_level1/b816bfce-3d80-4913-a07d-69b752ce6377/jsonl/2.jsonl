{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expresses distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of the journal (which is named after one of Hreidmar's sons).\n   - The specific word that was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The identities of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n   - The exact context in which the word was used to express distaste for dragon depictions.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house (from Norse mythology).\n   - The specific issue or volume of the journal where the article was published.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The journal is likely related to Norse mythology, given the reference to Hreidmar's son.\n   - The word in question could be something like \"cliché,\" \"overdone,\" or \"unrealistic,\" as these are common terms used to criticize depictions in literature or media.\n   - Hreidmar's son who guarded his house is probably Fafnir, who is often depicted as a dragon in Norse mythology.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Journal Name**: Use WebSurfer to search for information about Hreidmar's sons in Norse mythology to identify the son who guarded his house. This will help determine the name of the journal.\n- **Locate the Article**: Once the journal name is identified, use WebSurfer to find the specific June 2014 article by Emily Midkiff in that journal.\n- **Extract the Word**: After locating the article, use WebSurfer to read through the article and identify the word that was quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n- **Verify the Authors**: Ensure that the word is indeed quoted from two different authors and note their names.\n- **Summarize the Findings**: Compile the information into a concise summary, including the journal name, the word, and the authors' names."}

He is featured in the \nVölsunga saga and in \nSnorri Sturluson's \nProse Edda.\n[1]Hreiðmarr was the father of \nRegin, \nFafnir, \nÓtr, Lyngheiðr and Lofnheiðr. He owned a house of glittering gold and flashing gems built by Regin and guarded by Fafnir. After Otr was accidentally killed by \nLoki, the \nÆsir repaid Hreiðmarr with \nAndvari's gold and the ring \nAndvaranaut, a magical ring that could create gold. However, Andvari had cursed the ring to bring misfortune and destruction to whoever else possessed it. Hreiðmarr ignored Loki's warnings about the curse and kept the ring, only to have Fafnir and Regin later kill him for it. Fafnir decided he wanted Andvaranaut for himself, so he turned into a \ndragon and drove Regin away. Fafnir guarded the treasure until \nSigurd, on Regin's instigation, arrived and delivered a fatal blow to the dragon. Regin was then also killed by Sigurd while attempting to murder him for the ring, thus leaving all of Hreiðmarr's family dead.\n[2][3]See also[edit]Völsung CycleReferences[edit]^ \nVolsunga Saga, with Excerpts from the Poetic Edda (translated by William Morris and Eirikr Magnusson)^ \nReginsmál (Heimskringla)^ \nThe Story Within the Story: Otter's Ransom (Wilfrid Laurier University) Archived 2015-02-14 at the Wayback MachineOther sources[edit]Byock, Jesse L.

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters.

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children’s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children’s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDragons have long been a staple of children’s literature, appearing in everything from picture books to chapter books to young adult novels. These creatures, often depicted as fearsome and dangerous, have undergone a transformation in recent decades. Scholars such as John Clute and John Grant have lamented the trend to make dragons more friendly and less threatening, arguing that this softening ruins the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. For example, Clute and Grant both use the term **\"cliché\"** to describe the overuse of certain dragon tropes in modern children’s literature, suggesting that these depictions lack the depth and complexity of traditional dragon lore.\n\n**The Uncanny in Traditional Dragon Lore**\n\nTraditional Western dragon lore, particularly from Germanic and Anglo-Saxon traditions, emphasizes the eerie and unsettling nature of dragons. These creatures are not just large and scary; they create a distinct atmosphere of unease and fear. This uncanny quality is often linked to the dragon’s ability to manipulate and deceive, as well as its intense and possessive gaze. These traits are deeply rooted in the mythic and archetypal power of dragons, making them more than just physical threats but also psychological ones.\n\n**Modern Depictions of Dragons**\n\nDespite the trend to soften and satirize dragons, some modern children’s literature continues to draw on the uncanny qualities of traditional dragon lore. Authors such as J.K. Rowling and Christopher Paolini, for instance, have created dragons that retain elements of the traditional, unsettling dragon. These dragons are not simply friendly or comical; they are complex characters that evoke a sense of unease and fear, even when they are not overtly threatening.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the trend to soften and satirize dragons in children’s literature has been criticized for ruining the mythic and archetypal power of these creatures, there are still potent dragons lurking in modern children’s literature. By borrowing certain uncanny qualities from traditional dragon lore, these modern dragons maintain their mythic and archetypal power, making them strong and compelling characters that can be analyzed through a Freudian uncanny lens.\n\n**References**\n\nClute, John, and John Grant. *The Encyclopedia of Fantasy*.
