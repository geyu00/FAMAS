However, the script is currently returning an error. We need to debug the script and correct it.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Review the provided Python script to identify any syntax or logical errors.\n2. Correct the identified errors in the script.\n3. Test the corrected script with a sample input to ensure it works as expected.\n\n## Output format\n- The corrected Python script\n- The output of the script when tested with a sample input\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The script should correctly process the list of numbers and return the sum of the squares of the even numbers.\n- The script should handle edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with no even numbers.\n\n## Provided Python script\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\nresult = sum_of_squares_even(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```"}
{"agent": "PythonDebugging_Expert", "content": "The provided Python script looks generally correct for the task of summing the squares of even numbers. However, since you mentioned that there is an error related to a function not being found (specifically `seek_experts_help`), let's focus on the provided script to ensure that it runs without any issues and meets the output criteria.\n\nThe script does the following:\n1. It defines a list of numbers.\n2. It defines a function to calculate the sum of squares of even numbers.\n3. It invokes that function and prints the result.\n\nThe script should correctly handle an empty list or a list without even numbers, so let's add those edge cases as well. I will provide the corrected script and ensure it can be tested with different scenarios.\n\nHere's the revised script:\n\n```python\n# filename: sum_of_squares_even.py\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    if not numbers:  # Handle empty list case\n        return 0\n\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n\n    return sum_squares\n\n# Sample input\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nresult = sum_of_squares_even(numbers)\nprint(result)  # Expected output: 220 (2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 8^2 + 10^2)\n\n# Additional test cases\nprint(sum_of_squares_even([]))  # Expected output: 0 (empty list)\nprint(sum_of_squares_even([1, 3, 5, 7]))  # Expected output: 0 (no even numbers)\nprint(sum_of_squares_even([2, 4, 6, 8]))  # Expected output: 120 (2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 8^2)\n```\n\nThis updated script includes:\n- Handling for an empty list which will return 0.\n- Tests for different scenarios to ensure robustness.\n\nNow, let's run this code to verify its functionality. I'll provide it for execution. \n\n```sh\n# Execute the provided Python script\npython sum_of_squares_even.py\n```"}
