Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the American Alligator.\n   - The question is about when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source mentioned for this information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - This information can be found on the USGS website or in their publications related to wildlife distribution and historical records.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No derivations are necessary based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, so it's likely that any record of it being found west of Texas would be relatively recent.\n   - Given the alligator's natural range, it might have been introduced or migrated to areas west of Texas due to human activity or environmental changes, but this is speculative without specific data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Source**: Confirm that the USGS is the most reliable source for this information.\n- **Web Search**: Use WebSurfer to search the USGS website for historical records or reports on the distribution of the American Alligator.\n- **Extract Information**: Once the relevant page or document is found, use WebSurfer to extract the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n- **Verify Data**: Double-check the extracted information for accuracy and ensure it aligns with the context provided in the request.\n- **Report Findings**: Provide the year and any additional relevant details to the user."}

American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998).Disclaimer:\nThe Nonindigenous Occurrences section of the NAS species profiles has a new structure. The section is now dynamically updated from the NAS database to ensure that it contains the most current and accurate information. Occurrences are summarized in Table 1, alphabetically by state, with years of earliest and most recent observations, and the tally and names of drainages where the species was observed. The table contains hyperlinks to collections tables of specimens based on the states, years, and drainages selected.

See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The alligators spotted in Essex County, New Jersey, may have escaped a lagoon in Military Park, Newark (Anonymous in Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n Perhaps they had been part of a public animal display.\n The \nA. mississippiensis collected from Mesa County, Colorado, escaped from a roadside zoo (Livo et al., 1998), while the one collected from the Colorado River in California had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978).\n Conant (1977) suggested that an animal dealer intentionally established the \nA. mississippiensis population found in the Brownsville area of Cameron County, Texas.\nStatus: All the American alligators found in New York have been collected (Anderson and Habuda, 2001; Anonymous, 2001a, b; Beebe, 2001c; Heaton-Jones, 2001; Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). They are not established in this state nor could they survive the cold winters, and the story of alligators dwelling in New York City sewers is simply a well-entrenched myth (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). One of the alligators found in Union County, New Jersey, was collected; although there is no further word about the success of the 1933 great gator hunt started on the Passaic River in Essex County (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n All \nA. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).\n Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous \nA. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are \"thriving.\" There is no evidence of reproduction.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as \"not well established\" in Arizona.\nImpact of Introduction: There is no evidence that any of the nonindigenous occurrences of American alligators have had any impact on indigenous ecosystems; however, an established population of these massive carnivores in a southwestern state could negatively impact indigenous fauna. The introductions in Oklahoma, and the presumptive introduction in Cameron County, Texas, could compromise the genetic integrity of extant indigenous populations. As mentioned above, the status of indigenous alligators in Oklahoma could be obfuscated, thus creating difficulties when deciding conservation measures and future protective legislation. A large alligator is a potentially dangerous carnivore.\n While attacks on humans are exceedingly rare, they do occur on occasion (Pooley et al., 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Anonymous, 2002).\nRemarks: The taxonomy of A. mississippiensis has been reviewed or summarized by Smith and Smith (1977), King (1989), Ross and Ernst (1994), and Crother et al. (2000). Liner (1994) provides a Spanish vernacular name for the American alligator.  Brisbin et al. (1986), Gibbons and Semlitsch (1991), and Ross and Ernst (1994) provide the best literature reviews of the natural history of alligators. A variety of authors have contributed to or summarized the natural history and biology of American alligators (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973, 1976; Mount, 1975; Lang, 1987, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Vliet, 1989; and a variety of contributions compiled by Webb et al., 1987). Scientific and standard English names follow Crother (2008).Alligator mississippiensis is an aquatic, omnicarnivorous reptile capable of living in many types of waterways, both natural and man-made, and feeding upon almost any fauna it can catch (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Mount, 1975; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Some alligators dig deep holes with connecting dens than can remain filled with water during droughts, thus maintaining an aquatic environment for indigenous fauna (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Grenard, 1991).\n Courtship and mating involves complex visual and auditory displays directed at prospective mates and competitors (McIlhenny, 1935; Lang, 1987, 1989; Vliet, 1989).\n The female buries her hard-shelled eggs in a nest she constructs of dead vegetation and the surrounding muck (McIlhenny, 1935; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Females exhibit varying degrees of parental care by guarding the nest, releasing hatchlings from the nest and eggs, and transporting them to water in her mouth (Kushlan and Simon, 1981; Lang, 1987; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n Young may remain in a protective crèche with the mother and sometimes other adults for a considerable length of time, sometimes exceeding a year (Lang, 1987, 1989; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n American alligators are subject to a variety of state and federal regulations (Levell, 1997); they should not be obtained by anyone before such legislation is understood along the responsibility that goes with keeping them as captives.\nReferences \n(click for full references) Ashton, R.

Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as \"not well established\" in Arizona.\nImpact of Introduction: There is no evidence that any of the nonindigenous occurrences of American alligators have had any impact on indigenous ecosystems; however, an established population of these massive carnivores in a southwestern state could negatively impact indigenous fauna. The introductions in Oklahoma, and the presumptive introduction in Cameron County, Texas, could compromise the genetic integrity of extant indigenous populations. As mentioned above, the status of indigenous alligators in Oklahoma could be obfuscated, thus creating difficulties when deciding conservation measures and future protective legislation. A large alligator is a potentially dangerous carnivore.\n While attacks on humans are exceedingly rare, they do occur on occasion (Pooley et al., 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Anonymous, 2002).\nRemarks: The taxonomy of A. mississippiensis has been reviewed or summarized by Smith and Smith (1977), King (1989), Ross and Ernst (1994), and Crother et al. (2000). Liner (1994) provides a Spanish vernacular name for the American alligator.  Brisbin et al. (1986), Gibbons and Semlitsch (1991), and Ross and Ernst (1994) provide the best literature reviews of the natural history of alligators. A variety of authors have contributed to or summarized the natural history and biology of American alligators (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973, 1976; Mount, 1975; Lang, 1987, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Vliet, 1989; and a variety of contributions compiled by Webb et al., 1987).

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the American Alligator.\n   - The question is about when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source mentioned for this information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, including areas adjacent to the Texas border.\n   - The alligator has been reported in the Brownsville region of Texas, which is close to the border with Mexico, and there is debate about whether these populations are indigenous or introduced (Conant, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998; Ross and Ernst, 1994).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - This information can be found on the USGS website or in their publications related to wildlife distribution and historical records.\n   - Additional sources, such as state wildlife agencies or academic publications, may also contain relevant information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No derivations are necessary based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, so any record of it being found west of Texas would likely be relatively recent, possibly within the last few decades.\n   - Given the alligator's natural range, it might have been introduced or migrated to areas west of Texas due to human activity or environmental changes. For example, it could have been released as a pet or transported for other reasons.\n   - The debate about the indigenous status of alligators in the Brownsville region suggests that there might be historical records or early sightings that could provide clues about when alligators first appeared west of Texas.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The mention of the Brownsville region and the debate about the indigenous status of alligators there indicates that there might be historical records or early sightings that could help pinpoint the first occurrence west of Texas.\n- The alligator's ability to be transported and released by humans suggests that any findings west of Texas could be related to human activity, which is more likely to have occurred in recent times due to increased human mobility and awareness of exotic pets.\n\nThis updated fact sheet should help guide the search more effectively. Let's continue to focus on finding the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas using the USGS and other reliable sources.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure\n\n- **Lack of Specific Focus**: The previous attempts involved scrolling through the page without a clear focus on the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section, which contains the relevant data.\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: The repeated scrolling did not efficiently locate the specific information needed, leading to a waste of time and effort.\n- **Overlooking Key Sections**: The 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section, which likely contains the year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas, was not thoroughly examined.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Directly Navigate to the Relevant Section**:\n  - **Step 1**: Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F or Command + F) to search for \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\" on the page.\n  - **Step 2**: Once the section is located, carefully read through the table to find entries for states west of Texas (e.g., New Mexico, Arizona, California).\n\n- **Extract Specific Information**:\n  - **Step 3**: Identify the earliest year mentioned for any state west of Texas.\n  - **Step 4**: Verify the information by cross-referencing with the references provided on the page.\n\n- **Summarize and Report**:\n  - **Step 5**: Summarize the findings, including the specific year and the state where the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n  - **Step 6**: Provide any additional relevant details from the page.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Locate the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' Section**:\n   - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F or Command + F) to search for \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\".\n   - Scroll to the section and ensure it is fully visible in the viewport.\n\n2. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Read through the table to identify states west of Texas.\n   - Note the earliest year mentioned for each state.\n\n3. **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n   - Determine the earliest year among the states listed west of Texas.\n   - Verify the year by checking the references provided.\n\n4. **Summarize and Report**:\n   - Summarize the findings, including the specific year and the state.\n   - Provide any additional relevant details from the page.\n\n### Example Commands for WebSurfer\n\n- **Locate the Section**:\n  ```sh\n  search \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\"\n  ```\n\n- **Examine the Table**:\n  ```sh\n  scroll down 1 page\n  ```\n\n- **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n  ```sh\n  highlight \"StateFirst ObservedLast ObservedTotal HUCs with observations†HUCs with observations†\"\n  ```\n\n- **Summarize and Report**:\n  ```sh\n  summarize \"Earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas and the state where it was found\"\n  ```\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to efficiently locate and extract the required information."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the American Alligator.\n   - The question is about when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source mentioned for this information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, including areas adjacent to the Texas border.\n   - The alligator has been reported in the Brownsville region of Texas, which is close to the border with Mexico, and there is debate about whether these populations are indigenous or introduced (Conant, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998; Ross and Ernst, 1994).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - This information can be found on the USGS website or in their publications related to wildlife distribution and historical records.\n   - Additional sources, such as state wildlife agencies or academic publications, may also contain relevant information.\n   - The USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database tracks occurrences of non-native aquatic plant and animal species throughout the United States, including the American Alligator.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No derivations are necessary based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, so any record of it being found west of Texas would likely be relatively recent, possibly within the last few decades.\n   - Given the alligator's natural range, it might have been introduced or migrated to areas west of Texas due to human activity or environmental changes. For example, it could have been released as a pet or transported for other reasons.\n   - The debate about the indigenous status of alligators in the Brownsville region suggests that there might be historical records or early sightings that could provide clues about when alligators first appeared west of Texas.\n   - Based on the USGS NAS database, notable nonindigenous occurrences of American Alligators have been reported in states such as New York, New Jersey, West Virginia, Virginia, Indiana, Oklahoma, Colorado, and possibly Arizona and North Carolina. This suggests that the first occurrence west of Texas could be in one of these states or another western state.\n   - The earliest nonindigenous occurrence in a state west of Texas is likely to be documented in the USGS NAS database, which provides detailed records of the earliest and latest observations in each state.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The mention of the Brownsville region and the debate about the indigenous status of alligators there indicates that there might be historical records or early sightings that could help pinpoint the first occurrence west of Texas.\n- The alligator's ability to be transported and released by humans suggests that any findings west of Texas could be related to human activity, which is more likely to have occurred in recent times due to increased human mobility and awareness of exotic pets.\n- The USGS NAS database is a comprehensive resource that tracks nonindigenous occurrences, making it a reliable source for finding the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Locate the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' Section**:\n   - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F or Command + F) to search for \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\".\n   - Scroll to the section and ensure it is fully visible in the viewport.\n\n2. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Read through the table to identify states west of Texas (e.g., New Mexico, Arizona, California).\n   - Note the earliest year mentioned for each state.\n\n3. **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n   - Determine the earliest year among the states listed west of Texas.\n   - Verify the year by checking the references provided.\n\n4. **Summarize and Report**:\n   - Summarize the findings, including the specific year and the state where the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - Provide any additional relevant details from the page.\n\n### Example Commands for WebSurfer\n\n- **Locate the Section**:\n  ```sh\n  search \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\"\n  ```\n\n- **Examine the Table**:\n  ```sh\n  scroll down 1 page\n  ```\n\n- **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n  ```sh\n  highlight \"StateFirst ObservedLast ObservedTotal HUCs with observations†HUCs with observations†\"\n  ```\n\n- **Summarize and Report**:\n  ```sh\n  summarize \"Earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas and the state where it was found\"\n  ```\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to efficiently locate and extract the required information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure\n\n- **Lack of Direct Navigation**: The previous attempts involved searching for the term 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' but did not directly navigate to the specific section on the USGS website.\n- **Inefficient Search**: The search was performed on the Bing search results page rather than on the actual USGS page containing the detailed data.\n- **Repetition of Steps**: The same steps were repeated multiple times without making progress, indicating a need for a more directed approach.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - Open the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database page for the American Alligator.\n   - URL: `https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=1191`\n\n2. **Locate the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' Section**:\n   - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F or Command + F) to search for \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\" on the USGS page.\n   - Ensure the section is fully visible in the viewport.\n\n3. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Read through the table to identify states west of Texas (e.g., New Mexico, Arizona, California).\n   - Note the earliest year mentioned for each state.\n\n4. **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n   - Determine the earliest year among the states listed west of Texas.\n   - Verify the year by checking the references provided.\n\n5. **Summarize and Report**:\n   - Summarize the findings, including the specific year and the state where the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - Provide any additional relevant details from the page.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Open the Correct Page**:\n  ```sh\n  navigate \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=1191\"\n  ```\n\n- **Locate the Section**:\n  ```sh\n  search \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\"\n  ```\n\n- **Examine the Table**:\n  ```sh\n  scroll down 1 page\n  ```\n\n- **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n  ```sh\n  highlight \"StateFirst ObservedLast ObservedTotal HUCs with observations†HUCs with observations†\"\n  ```\n\n- **Summarize and Report**:\n  ```sh\n  summarize \"Earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas and the state where it was found\"\n  ```\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to efficiently locate and extract the required information from the correct source."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the American Alligator.\n   - The question is about when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source mentioned for this information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, including areas adjacent to the Texas border.\n   - The alligator has been reported in the Brownsville region of Texas, which is close to the border with Mexico, and there is debate about whether these populations are indigenous or introduced (Conant, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998; Ross and Ernst, 1994).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - This information can be found on the USGS website or in their publications related to wildlife distribution and historical records.\n   - Additional sources, such as state wildlife agencies or academic publications, may also contain relevant information.\n   - The USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database tracks occurrences of non-native aquatic plant and animal species throughout the United States, including the American Alligator.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No derivations are necessary based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, so any record of it being found west of Texas would likely be relatively recent, possibly within the last few decades.\n   - Given the alligator's natural range, it might have been introduced or migrated to areas west of Texas due to human activity or environmental changes. For example, it could have been released as a pet or transported for other reasons.\n   - The debate about the indigenous status of alligators in the Brownsville region suggests that there might be historical records or early sightings that could provide clues about when alligators first appeared west of Texas.\n   - Based on the USGS NAS database, notable nonindigenous occurrences of American Alligators have been reported in states such as New York, New Jersey, West Virginia, Virginia, Indiana, Oklahoma, Colorado, and possibly Arizona and North Carolina. This suggests that the first occurrence west of Texas could be in one of these states or another western state.\n   - The earliest nonindigenous occurrence in a state west of Texas is likely to be documented in the USGS NAS database, which provides detailed records of the earliest and latest observations in each state.\n   - Given the difficulty in locating the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section, it is possible that the information is embedded within a different section or requires a more specific search term. For example, searching for 'American Alligator' followed by 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' might yield better results.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The mention of the Brownsville region and the debate about the indigenous status of alligators there indicates that there might be historical records or early sightings that could help pinpoint the first occurrence west of Texas.\n- The alligator's ability to be transported and released by humans suggests that any findings west of Texas could be related to human activity, which is more likely to have occurred in recent times due to increased human mobility and awareness of exotic pets.\n- The USGS NAS database is a comprehensive resource that tracks nonindigenous occurrences, making it a reliable source for finding the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n- The difficulty in locating the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section suggests that the information might be nested within a more detailed section or require a more precise search term.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Locate the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' Section**:\n   - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F or Command + F) to search for \"American Alligator\" and then look for \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\" within the results.\n   - Scroll to the section and ensure it is fully visible in the viewport.\n\n2. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Read through the table to identify states west of Texas (e.g., New Mexico, Arizona, California).\n   - Note the earliest year mentioned for each state.\n\n3. **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n   - Determine the earliest year among the states listed west of Texas.\n   - Verify the year by checking the references provided.\n\n4. **Summarize and Report**:\n   - Summarize the findings, including the specific year and the state where the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - Provide any additional relevant details from the page.\n\n### Example Commands for WebSurfer\n\n- **Locate the Section**:\n  ```sh\n  search \"American Alligator\"\n  ```\n\n- **Find Nonindigenous Occurrences**:\n  ```sh\n  search \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\"\n  ```\n\n- **Examine the Table**:\n  ```sh\n  scroll down 1 page\n  ```\n\n- **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n  ```sh\n  highlight \"StateFirst ObservedLast ObservedTotal HUCs with observations†HUCs with observations†\"\n  ```\n\n- **Summarize and Report**:\n  ```sh\n  summarize \"Earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas and the state where it was found\"\n  ```\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to efficiently locate and extract the required information from the USGS NAS database.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Search Term**: The search term 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' did not directly lead to the relevant section, possibly because the term is not unique or is embedded within a larger context.\n- **Inefficient Scrolling**: Scrolling down one page at a time was not effective in quickly locating the desired section.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: The search was too broad and did not focus on the specific species (American Alligator) and the specific information needed (first occurrence west of Texas).\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - Open the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database page for the American Alligator.\n   - URL: `https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=1191`\n\n2. **Search for the Specific Section**:\n   - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F or Command + F) to search for \"American Alligator\" to ensure we are on the correct species page.\n   - Then, search for \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\" to locate the relevant section.\n\n3. **Scroll to the Section**:\n   - If the section is not immediately visible, scroll down incrementally until the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' table is fully visible.\n\n4. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Read through the table to identify states west of Texas (e.g., New Mexico, Arizona, California).\n   - Note the earliest year mentioned for each state.\n\n5. **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n   - Determine the earliest year among the states listed west of Texas.\n   - Verify the year by checking the references provided.\n\n6. **Summarize and Report**:\n   - Summarize the findings, including the specific year and the state where the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - Provide any additional relevant details from the page.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Open the Correct Page**:\n  ```sh\n  navigate \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=1191\"\n  ```\n\n- **Search for the Specific Section**:\n  ```sh\n  search \"American Alligator\"\n  search \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\"\n  ```\n\n- **Scroll to the Section**:\n  ```sh\n  scroll down 1 page\n  ```\n\n- **Examine the Table**:\n  ```sh\n  highlight \"StateFirst ObservedLast ObservedTotal HUCs with observations†HUCs with observations†\"\n  ```\n\n- **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n  ```sh\n  highlight \"StateFirst Observed\"\n  ```\n\n- **Summarize and Report**:\n  ```sh\n  summarize \"Earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas and the state where it was found\"\n  ```\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to efficiently locate and extract the required information from the USGS NAS database."}

For example, it could have been released as a pet or transported for other reasons.\n   - The debate about the indigenous status of alligators in the Brownsville region suggests that there might be historical records or early sightings that could provide clues about when alligators first appeared west of Texas.\n   - Notable nonindigenous occurrences of American Alligators have been reported in states such as New York, New Jersey, West Virginia, Virginia, Indiana, Oklahoma, Colorado, and possibly Arizona and North Carolina. This suggests that the first occurrence west of Texas could be in one of these states or another western state.\n   - The earliest nonindigenous occurrence in a state west of Texas is likely to be documented in the USGS NAS database, which provides detailed records of the earliest and latest observations in each state.\n   - The 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section on the USGS NAS database page for the American Alligator is a critical resource for finding this information. However, the section might be nested within a more detailed part of the page or require a more specific search term to locate it effectively.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The mention of the Brownsville region and the debate about the indigenous status of alligators there indicates that there might be historical records or early sightings that could help pinpoint the first occurrence west of Texas.\n- The alligator's ability to be transported and released by humans suggests that any findings west of Texas could be related to human activity, which is more likely to have occurred in recent times due to increased human mobility and awareness of exotic pets.\n- The USGS NAS database is a comprehensive resource that tracks nonindigenous occurrences, making it a reliable source for finding the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n- The difficulty in locating the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section suggests that the information might be nested within a more detailed section or require a more precise search term. For example, searching for 'American Alligator' followed by 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' might yield better results.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - Open the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database page for the American Alligator: https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=1191.\n   - Ensure the page is fully loaded.\n\n2. **Search for the Specific Section**:\n   - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F or Command + F) to search for \"American Alligator\" to ensure we are on the correct species page.\n   - Then, search for \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\" to locate the relevant section.\n\n3. **Scroll to the Section**:\n   - If the section is not immediately visible, scroll down incrementally until the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' table is fully visible.\n\n4. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Read through the table to identify states west of Texas (e.g., New Mexico, Arizona, California).\n   - Note the earliest year mentioned for each state.\n\n5. **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n   - Determine the earliest year among the states listed west of Texas.\n   - Verify the year by checking the references provided.\n\n6. **Summarize and Report**:\n   - Summarize the findings, including the specific year and the state where the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - Provide any additional relevant details from the page.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Open the Correct Page**:\n  ```sh\n  navigate \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=1191\"\n  ```\n\n- **Search for the Specific Section**:\n  ```sh\n  search \"American Alligator\"\n  search \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\"\n  ```\n\n- **Scroll to the Section**:\n  ```sh\n  scroll down 1 page\n  ```\n\n- **Examine the Table**:\n  ```sh\n  highlight \"StateFirst ObservedLast ObservedTotal HUCs with observations†HUCs with observations†\"\n  ```\n\n- **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n  ```sh\n  highlight \"StateFirst Observed\"\n  ```\n\n- **Summarize and Report**:\n  ```sh\n  summarize \"Earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas and the state where it was found\"\n  ```\n\nBy following this updated plan, we should be able to efficiently locate and extract the required information from the USGS NAS database.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: The web browser was navigated to the main USGS NAS page instead of the specific fact sheet page for the American Alligator.\n- **Ineffective Search**: The search for 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' was performed on the wrong page, leading to irrelevant results.\n- **Lack of Verification**: There was no verification step to ensure that the correct page was loaded before proceeding with the search.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - Use the browser to navigate to the specific fact sheet page for the American Alligator: https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=1191.\n   - Verify that the page is fully loaded and that it is the correct page by checking for the title \"American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis)\".\n\n2. **Search for the Specific Section**:\n   - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F or Command + F) to search for \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\".\n   - If the section is not immediately visible, scroll down incrementally until the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' table is fully visible.\n\n3. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Read through the table to identify states west of Texas (e.g., New Mexico, Arizona, California).\n   - Note the earliest year mentioned for each state.\n\n4. **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n   - Determine the earliest year among the states listed west of Texas.\n   - Verify the year by checking the references provided.\n\n5. **Summarize and Report**:\n   - Summarize the findings, including the specific year and the state where the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - Provide any additional relevant details from the page.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n  ```sh\n  navigate \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=1191\"\n  ```\n\n- **Verify the Page**:\n  ```sh\n  search \"American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis)\"\n  ```\n\n- **Search for the Specific Section**:\n  ```sh\n  search \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\"\n  ```\n\n- **Scroll to the Section**:\n  ```sh\n  scroll down 1 page\n  ```\n\n- **Examine the Table**:\n  ```sh\n  highlight \"StateFirst ObservedLast ObservedTotal HUCs with observations†HUCs with observations†\"\n  ```\n\n- **Identify the Earliest Year**:\n  ```sh\n  highlight \"StateFirst Observed\"\n  ```\n\n- **Summarize and Report**:\n  ```sh\n  summarize \"Earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas and the state where it was found\"\n  ```\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to efficiently locate and extract the required information from the USGS NAS database."}
