Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n   - The restaurants should not be takeaway only.\n   - The restaurants must offer vegan mains.\n   - The vegan mains should cost under $15.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n   - Information on whether these restaurants serve vegan mains.\n   - Prices of vegan mains at these restaurants.\n   - Verification that the restaurants are not takeaway only.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Google Maps, Yelp, restaurant websites, and local food blogs.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which of the listed restaurants meet all the criteria (location, vegan options, price, and dine-in service).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the area around Washington Square Park, it is likely that there are several restaurants that cater to various dietary preferences, including vegan options.\n   - Some popular chains or local eateries known for affordable vegan options might be located in the area, such as fast-casual spots or cafes.\n   - Given the location in a bustling part of New York City, it's reasonable to assume that there are multiple dining options within the specified radius.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find a list of restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the websites or online profiles (e.g., Yelp, Google Maps) of the identified restaurants to check if they offer vegan mains.\n- **WebSurfer**: Verify the prices of the vegan mains to ensure they are under $15.\n- **WebSurfer**: Confirm that the restaurants are not takeaway only by checking their website or online profiles for dine-in information.\n- **Assistant**: Compile the findings into a list of restaurants that meet all the criteria.\n- **Assistant**: Present the final list to the user."}

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n   - The restaurants should not be takeaway only.\n   - The restaurants must offer vegan mains.\n   - The vegan mains should cost under $15.\n   - **Rosemary's** is a restaurant within 1 block of Washington Square Park, located at 18 Greenwich Avenue, New York, NY 10011.\n   - Rosemary's is not takeaway only; it offers dine-in service.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of other restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n   - Information on whether Rosemary's serves vegan mains and their prices.\n   - Information on whether other identified restaurants serve vegan mains.\n   - Prices of vegan mains at other identified restaurants.\n   - Verification that other identified restaurants are not takeaway only.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Google Maps, Yelp, restaurant websites, and local food blogs.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which of the listed restaurants meet all the criteria (location, vegan options, price, and dine-in service).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the area around Washington Square Park, it is likely that there are several restaurants that cater to various dietary preferences, including vegan options.\n   - Some popular chains or local eateries known for affordable vegan options might be located in the area, such as fast-casual spots or cafes.\n   - Given the location in a bustling part of New York City, it's reasonable to assume that there are multiple dining options within the specified radius.\n   - **Rosemary's** is a high-end Italian restaurant, and while it may offer vegan options, the prices might not fall under $15. We need to verify this.\n   - Other restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park, such as **Babbo**, **Monte's Trattoria**, **Union Square Cafe**, **Sant Ambroeus West Village**, and **Il Cantinori**, should be checked for vegan mains under $15 and dine-in service.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **WebSurfer**: Visit Rosemary's menu page to check for vegan mains and their prices.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find a list of other restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Visit the websites or online profiles of the other identified restaurants to check if they offer vegan mains under $15 and confirm that they are not takeaway only.\n4. **Assistant**: Compile the findings into a list of restaurants that meet all the criteria.\n5. **Assistant**: Present the final list to the user.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Navigation**: The WebSurfer did not efficiently navigate to the specific sections of the Rosemary's menu to check for vegan mains and their prices.\n2. **Lack of Systematic Approach**: The process of verifying each restaurant's details (vegan options, prices, and dine-in service) was not systematic, leading to incomplete information.\n3. **Repetition of Steps**: The WebSurfer repeated the same steps without progressing to the next restaurant, which slowed down the process and led to redundant actions.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Initial Web Search**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find a comprehensive list of restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and basic details (e.g., addresses) of these restaurants.\n\n2. **Systematic Verification**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each restaurant, visit their official website or online profiles (e.g., Yelp, Google Maps).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check if the restaurant offers vegan mains and note the prices.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the restaurant is not takeaway only by checking for dine-in options.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Document the findings for each restaurant.\n\n3. **Compile and Filter**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the findings into a list of restaurants that meet all the criteria (location, vegan options, price, and dine-in service).\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final list to the user.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initial Web Search**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and basic details of the restaurants from the search results.\n\n2. **Systematic Verification**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each restaurant:\n     - Visit the restaurant's official website or online profile.\n     - Check the menu for vegan mains and note the prices.\n     - Verify that the restaurant is not takeaway only by checking for dine-in options.\n     - Document the findings for each restaurant.\n\n3. **Compile and Filter**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the findings into a list of restaurants that meet all the criteria.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final list to the user.\n\n### Example Script\n\n```sh\n# Step 1: Initial Web Search\nweb_search \"restaurants within 1 block of Washington Square Park\"\n\n# Step 2: Systematic Verification\nfor restaurant in $(extract_restaurant_names_from_results); do\n    visit_website_or_profile $restaurant\n    check_vegan_mains_and_prices\n    verify_dine_in_options\n    document_findings $restaurant\ndone\n\n# Step 3: Compile and Filter\ncompile_findings\npresent_final_list\n```\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Efficient Navigation**: Use specific search terms and navigation actions to quickly find the relevant sections on each restaurant's website or profile.\n- **Systematic Approach**: Create a checklist or template to ensure all necessary information is gathered for each restaurant.\n- **Avoid Repetition**: Once a restaurant's details are verified, move on to the next restaurant without revisiting the same steps."}
