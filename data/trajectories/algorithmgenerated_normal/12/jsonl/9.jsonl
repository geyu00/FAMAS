{"agent": "MBTA_FranciscoFoxboroLine_Expert", "content": "To solve this task, I will first list all the stops on the MBTA’s Franklin-Foxboro line accurately. Then, I'll locate South Station and Windsor Gardens on the list and count the number of stops in between, excluding the two mentioned stations. \n\n### Step 1: List all the stops on the MBTA’s Franklin-Foxboro line\n\nThe stops on the Franklin-Foxboro line are as follows (as of May 2023):\n\n1. South Station\n2. Back Bay\n3. Forest Hills\n4. Readville\n5. Hyde Park\n6. Canton Junction\n7. Sharon\n8. Walpole\n9. Norfolk\n10. Franklin\n11. Dean College\n12. Foxboro\n13. Windsor Gardens\n\n### Step 2: Locate South Station and Windsor Gardens\n\n- **South Station** is the first stop on the list.\n- **Windsor Gardens** is the last stop on the list.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens\n\nTo find the number of stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens (excluding both), I will count the stops listed from the second position (Back Bay) to the second to last position (Foxboro).\n\n**Counting the stops:**\n- Back Bay\n- Forest Hills\n- Readville\n- Hyde Park\n- Canton Junction\n- Sharon\n- Walpole\n- Norfolk\n- Franklin\n- Dean College\n- Foxboro\n\nThere are a total of **11 stops** between South Station and Windsor Gardens.\n\nThus, the answer to the task is:\n\n```python\nnumber_of_stops = 11\nprint(number_of_stops)\n``` \n\nNow I will execute this code in the Computer_terminal to confirm the count."}
