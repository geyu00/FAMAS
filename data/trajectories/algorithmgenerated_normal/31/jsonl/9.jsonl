Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify the contributor to OpenCV 4.1.2 who has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Identify the contributors to OpenCV 4.1.2.\n2. Compare the names of the contributors with the names of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n\n## Output format\n- Name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n- Evidence of the match (e.g., links to GitHub profiles, historical records).\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure the accuracy of the OpenCV version and contributors.\n- Correctly identify the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n- Provide a clear and concise answer with verifiable evidence."}
{"agent": "OpenCV_Expert", "content": "To solve the task, I will follow the manager's plan step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Contributors to OpenCV 4.1.2\n\nI will first check the official OpenCV repository to find the contributors for version 4.1.2. I'll look for the changelog or tags in the repository for this version.\n\nLet's fetch the contributor data for OpenCV version 4.1.2. \n\n### Step 2: Fetching Contributors\n\nI will check the GitHub repository for OpenCV and extract the list of contributors for version 4.1.2. This may involve looking at the tags associated with this version.\n\nLet me execute the following command in a shell to get the contributors:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git\ncd opencv\ngit tag\ngit log --format='%an' 4.1.2\n```\n\nI will run this and provide the list of contributors."}
