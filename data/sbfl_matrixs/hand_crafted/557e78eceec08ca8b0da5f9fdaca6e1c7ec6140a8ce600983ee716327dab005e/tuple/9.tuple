A list of other bars near the Mummers Museum.\n   - Information on the wheelchair accessibility of these other bars.\n   - Specific distances between the Mummers Museum and other nearby bars.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The closest bar to the Mummers Museum based on the distances obtained.\n   - Confirmation that the closest bar is indeed wheelchair accessible.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Mummers Museum is likely located in a part of Philadelphia where there are several bars, given the cultural and historical significance of the Mummers in the city.\n   - Popular local review sites like Yelp or Google Maps might provide detailed information about the accessibility of bars in the area.\n   - Based on the initial search, some of the bars near the Mummers Museum include:\n     - 12 Steps Down (831 Christian St, Philadelphia, PA 19147)\n     - The Pub on Passyunk East (1501 E Passyunk Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19147)\n     - Dirty Franks\n     - Milkboy Coffee\n     - Varga Bar & Restaurant\n   - 12 Steps Down is confirmed to be wheelchair accessible, with both a wheelchair accessible entrance and parking lot.\n   - The Pub on Passyunk East is likely wheelchair accessible, as many modern establishments in urban areas are designed to be accessible, but this needs verification.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The initial search provided a list of bars near the Mummers Museum, which helps narrow down the options.\n- 12 Steps Down is confirmed to be wheelchair accessible, which is a significant piece of information that can help in the final decision.\n- The Pub on Passyunk East is a well-known establishment and is likely to be accessible, but we need to verify this to ensure accuracy.\n- We need to verify the wheelchair accessibility and distances for the other bars to ensure we have a comprehensive comparison.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Verify Wheelchair Accessibility of The Pub on Passyunk East**:\n   -

The search queries were too broad and did not yield specific, actionable information about the distances and wheelchair accessibility of the bars.\n   - We did not directly verify the wheelchair accessibility and distances for each bar, leading to incomplete information.\n\n2. **Lack of Direct Verification**:\n   - We relied too heavily on initial search results without verifying the information from multiple sources or the official websites of the establishments.\n\n3. **Repetition of Searches**:\n   - We repeated similar searches multiple times without refining the approach or using the information already gathered effectively.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use specific search queries to find the exact addresses and wheelchair accessibility of the bars.\n   - Example query: \"The Pub on Passyunk East address and wheelchair accessibility\".\n\n2. **Direct Verification**:\n   - For each bar, visit the official website or Google Maps to verify the address, wheelchair accessibility, and distance from the Mummers Museum.\n   - Use Google Maps to get the exact walking distance from the Mummers Museum (1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147) to each bar.\n\n3. **Organize Information**:\n   - Create a table or list to keep track of the bars, their addresses, wheelchair accessibility, and distances.\n   - Ensure all information is verified and recorded accurately.\n\n4. **Final Selection**:\n   - Once all the information is gathered, compare the distances and wheelchair accessibility to determine the closest and accessible bar.\n   - Provide the final answer with the name, address, and distance of the closest and wheelchair-accessible bar.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Queries**\n  -
