{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking for the highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n   - Specific real estate data for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for the year 2021.\n   - These facts can be found in real estate databases, such as Zillow, Redfin, or the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office. Additionally, local real estate news articles or reports from real estate firms like CBRE or Knight Frank might provide this information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific facts need to be derived from the given information. The required fact is a direct piece of data that can be obtained from the sources listed above.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge of the San Francisco real estate market, high-rise apartments in prime locations like Mission Bay often sell for several million dollars. However, without specific data, it is difficult to make an accurate guess about the exact highest price in 2021.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for real estate data for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for the year 2021.\n  - **Sources to check:**\n    - Zillow\n    - Redfin\n    - San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office website\n    - Local real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms\n\n- **Step 2:** Once the relevant data is found, use WebSurfer to extract the highest sale price for a high-rise apartment in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n\n- **Step 3:** Verify the extracted data by cross-referencing with at least one additional source to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Step 4:** Provide the verified highest sale price to the Assistant for final presentation.\n\n- **Step 5:** If necessary, use FileSurger to save any relevant data or screenshots for record-keeping."}

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking for the highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n   - The median sale price of a home in Mission Bay, San Francisco, as of a recent month in 2021, was $945,000, down 8.7% since the previous year. (Source: Redfin)\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n   - Specific real estate data for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for the year 2021.\n   - These facts can be found in real estate databases, such as Zillow, Redfin, or the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office. Additionally, local real estate news articles or reports from real estate firms like CBRE or Knight Frank might provide this information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific facts need to be derived from the given information. The required fact is a direct piece of data that can be obtained from the sources listed above.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the median sale price of $945,000 and the general knowledge of the San Francisco real estate market, it is reasonable to assume that the highest price for a high-rise apartment in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021 could be significantly higher, potentially in the range of $2 million to $3 million. This is because high-rise apartments in prime locations often command premium prices.\n   - One specific data point from a real estate news article mentions a high-rise apartment in Mission Bay selling for $2,250,000 in 2021. (Source: San Francisco Condo Mania) This suggests that the highest price could be around this amount or even higher, given the variability in high-end sales.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The median sale price provides a baseline understanding of the market, indicating that while the average price was $945,000, there were likely higher-end sales.\n- The specific data point from San Francisco Condo Mania gives a concrete example of a high sale price, which helps narrow down the range for the highest price.\n- Given the premium nature of high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, it is plausible that the highest sale price could be significantly above the median, potentially reaching the upper end of the $2 million to $3 million range.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect URLs and Navigation**: The initial attempts to navigate to the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office website resulted in 404 errors due to incorrect URLs.\n2. **Limited Search Scope**: The search queries used were too broad and did not directly lead to the specific data needed. The results often included general real estate information rather than the specific high sale price for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n3. **Lack of Direct Data Sources**: The search did not effectively target direct data sources like specific real estate reports or detailed transaction records.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific search terms to target real estate reports and transaction records for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n   - Example search terms: \"highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 report\" or \"Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales data.\"\n\n2. **Directly Access Reliable Sources**:\n   - Navigate to specific sections of Zillow, Redfin, and the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office website that provide detailed transaction data.\n   - For Zillow and Redfin, use advanced search filters to focus on high-rise apartments in Mission Bay for the year 2021.\n\n3. **Check Real Estate News and Reports**:\n   - Search for real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms like CBRE, Knight Frank, or local real estate publications that might have summarized the highest sale prices for 2021.\n\n4. **Use WebSurfer Effectively**:\n   - Ensure WebSurfer scrolls through pages and clicks on relevant links to access detailed information.\n   - Use WebSurfer to summarize pages and extract specific data points, such as the highest sale price.\n\n5. **Cross-Reference Data**:\n   - Verify the extracted data by cross-referencing with at least one additional source to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Save Relevant Data**:\n   - Use FileSurfer to save any relevant data or screenshots for record-keeping.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Queries**\n  - Use the search terms: \"highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 report\" or \"Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales data.\"\n  \n- **Step 2: Access Zillow and Redfin**\n  - Navigate to Zillow and Redfin.\n  - Use advanced search filters to focus on high-rise apartments in Mission Bay for the year 2021.\n  - Extract the highest sale price data.\n\n- **Step 3: Access San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office**\n  - Navigate to the correct URL: https://sfgov.org/assessor-recorder.\n  - Look for a section or link that provides access to real estate transaction data, particularly for Mission Bay in 2021.\n\n- **Step 4: Check Real Estate News and Reports**\n  - Search for real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms like CBRE, Knight Frank, or local real estate publications.\n  - Extract the highest sale price data.\n\n- **Step 5: Cross-Reference Data**\n  - Verify the extracted data by cross-referencing with at least one additional source.\n\n- **Step 6: Save Relevant Data**\n  - Use FileSurfer to save any relevant data or screenshots for record-keeping.\n\n- **Step 7: Provide the Verified Highest Sale Price**\n  - Present the verified highest sale price to the Assistant for final presentation."}

This is because high-rise apartments in prime locations often command premium prices.\n   - Given the specific data point from San Francisco Condo Mania, which mentions a high-rise apartment selling for $2,250,000 in 2021, it is plausible that this could be the highest sale price or very close to it. However, further verification is needed to confirm if this is indeed the highest price.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The median sale price provides a baseline understanding of the market, indicating that while the average price was $945,000, there were likely higher-end sales.\n- The specific data point from San Francisco Condo Mania gives a concrete example of a high sale price, which helps narrow down the range for the highest price.\n- Given the premium nature of high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, it is plausible that the highest sale price could be significantly above the median, potentially reaching the upper end of the $2 million to $3 million range.\n- The $2,250,000 sale price from San Francisco Condo Mania is a strong indicator that this could be the highest price, but additional sources should be checked to confirm this.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**\n   - Use more specific search terms to target real estate reports and transaction records for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n   - Example search terms: \"highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 report\" or \"Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales data.\"\n\n2. **Directly Access Reliable Sources**\n   - Navigate to specific sections of Zillow, Redfin, and the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office website that provide detailed transaction data.\n   - For Zillow and Redfin, use advanced search filters to focus on high-rise apartments in Mission Bay for the year 2021.\n\n3. **Check Real Estate News and Reports**\n   - Search for real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms like CBRE, Knight Frank, or local real estate publications that might have summarized the highest sale prices for 2021.\n\n4. **Use WebSurfer Effectively**\n   - Ensure WebSurfer scrolls through pages and clicks on relevant links to access detailed information.\n   - Use WebSurfer to summarize pages and extract specific data points, such as the highest sale price.\n\n5. **Cross-Reference Data**\n   - Verify the extracted data by cross-referencing with at least one additional source to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Save Relevant Data**\n   - Use FileSurfer to save any relevant data or screenshots for record-keeping.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Queries**\n  - Use the search terms: \"highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 report\" or \"Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales data.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Access Zillow and Redfin**\n  - Navigate to Zillow and Redfin.\n  - Use advanced search filters to focus on high-rise apartments in Mission Bay for the year 2021.\n  - Extract the highest sale price data.\n\n- **Step 3: Access San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office**\n  - Navigate to the correct URL: https://sfgov.org/assessor-recorder.\n  - Look for a section or link that provides access to real estate transaction data, particularly for Mission Bay in 2021.\n\n- **Step 4: Check Real Estate News and Reports**\n  - Search for real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms like CBRE, Knight Frank, or local real estate publications.\n  - Extract the highest sale price data.\n\n- **Step 5: Cross-Reference Data**\n  - Verify the extracted data by cross-referencing with at least one additional source.\n\n- **Step 6: Save Relevant Data**\n  - Use FileSurfer to save any relevant data or screenshots for record-keeping.\n\n- **Step 7: Provide the Verified Highest Sale Price**\n  - Present the verified highest sale price to the Assistant for final presentation.\n\n### Immediate Action\n\nPlease navigate to the following URLs and extract the highest sale price for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021:\n1.

The $2,250,000 sale price remains a strong candidate for the highest price, but verifying this through multiple sources will provide a more accurate answer.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The median sale price provides a baseline understanding of the market, indicating that while the average price was $945,000, there were likely higher-end sales.\n- The specific data point from San Francisco Condo Mania gives a concrete example of a high sale price, which helps narrow down the range for the highest price.\n- Given the premium nature of high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, it is plausible that the highest sale price could be significantly above the median, potentially reaching the upper end of the $2 million to $3 million range.\n- The $2,250,000 sale price from San Francisco Condo Mania is a strong indicator that this could be the highest price, but additional sources should be checked to confirm this.\n- The issues with accessing Redfin and Zillow suggest that alternative sources like the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office or local real estate news articles might be more reliable for extracting the required data.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**\n   - Use more specific search terms to target real estate reports and transaction records for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n   - Example search terms: \"highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 report\" or \"Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales data.\"\n\n2. **Directly Access Reliable Sources**\n   - Navigate to specific sections of the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office website that provide detailed transaction data.\n   - For San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office: https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Real-Estate-Sales-Data/r8cy-jpz4\n\n3. **Check Real Estate News and Reports**\n   - Search for real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms like CBRE, Knight Frank, or local real estate publications.\n   - Example search terms: \"Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales report\" or \"highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay 2021 news.\"\n\n4. **Use WebSurfer Effectively**\n   - Ensure WebSurfer scrolls through pages and clicks on relevant links to access detailed information.\n   - Use WebSurfer to summarize pages and extract specific data points, such as the highest sale price.\n   - If a CAPTCHA appears, use WebSurfer to navigate through it or try a different source.\n\n5. **Cross-Reference Data**\n   - Verify the extracted data by cross-referencing with at least one additional source to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Save Relevant Data**\n   - Use FileSurfer to save any relevant data or screenshots for record-keeping.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Queries**\n  - Use the search terms: \"highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 report\" or \"Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales data.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Access San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office**\n  - Navigate to: https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Real-Estate-Sales-Data/r8cy-jpz4\n  - Look for a section or link that provides access to real estate transaction data, particularly for Mission Bay in 2021.\n  - Extract the highest sale price data.\n\n- **Step 3: Check Real Estate News and Reports**\n  - Search for real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms like CBRE, Knight Frank, or local real estate publications.\n  - Extract the highest sale price data.\n\n- **Step 4: Cross-Reference Data**\n  - Verify the extracted data by cross-referencing with at least one additional source.\n\n- **Step 5: Save Relevant Data**\n  - Use FileSurfer to save any relevant data or screenshots for record-keeping.\n\n- **Step 6: Provide the Verified Highest Sale Price**\n  - Present the verified highest sale price to the Assistant for final presentation.\n\n### Immediate Action\n\nPlease navigate to the following URL and extract the highest sale price for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021:\n1.

The results often included general real estate information rather than the specific high sale price for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n\n4. **Lack of Direct Data Sources**:\n   - The search did not effectively target direct data sources like specific real estate reports or detailed transaction records.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Focus on Reliable Sources**:\n   - Prioritize the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office and local real estate news articles, which are less likely to have CAPTCHA or access issues.\n\n2. **Use Specific Search Terms**:\n   - Use more targeted search terms to find real estate reports and transaction records for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n\n3. **Navigate and Extract Data from the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office**:\n   - Directly access the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office data portal and use advanced filters to focus on high-rise apartments in Mission Bay for the year 2021.\n\n4. **Check Local Real Estate News and Reports**:\n   - Search for real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms like CBRE, Knight Frank, or local real estate publications.\n\n5. **Use WebSurfer Effectively**:\n   - Ensure WebSurfer scrolls through pages, clicks on relevant links, and extracts specific data points, such as the highest sale price.\n\n6. **Cross-Reference Data**:\n   - Verify the extracted data by cross-referencing with at least one additional source to ensure accuracy.\n\n7. **Save Relevant Data**:\n   - Use FileSurfer to save any relevant data or screenshots for record-keeping.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1: Access San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office**\n  - Navigate to: https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Real-Estate-Sales-Data/r8cy-jpz4\n  - Use advanced search filters to focus on high-rise apartments in Mission Bay for the year 2021.\n  - Extract the highest sale price data.\n\n- **Step 2: Check Local Real Estate News and Reports**\n  - Search for real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms like CBRE, Knight Frank, or local real estate publications.\n  - Example search terms: \"Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales report\" or \"highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay 2021 news.\"\n  - Extract the highest sale price data.\n\n- **Step 3: Cross-Reference Data**\n  - Verify the extracted data by cross-referencing with at least one additional source.\n\n- **Step 4: Save Relevant Data**\n  - Use FileSurfer to save any relevant data or screenshots for record-keeping.\n\n- **Step 5: Provide the Verified Highest Sale Price**\n  - Present the verified highest sale price to the Assistant for final presentation.\n\n### Immediate Action\n\nPlease navigate to the following URL and extract the highest sale price for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021:\n1.

(Source: Attempted access)\n- The San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office website (https://www.sfgov.org/assessorsrecorder) and the specific data portal (https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Real-Estate-Sales-Data/r8cy-jpz4) are not accessible, leading to a \"Page Not Found\" error. (Source: Attempted access)\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The highest price a high-rise apartment was sold for in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n- Specific real estate data for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, for the year 2021.\n- These facts can be found in real estate databases, such as the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office, or local real estate news articles or reports from real estate firms like CBRE or Knight Frank.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- No specific facts need to be derived from the given information. The required fact is a direct piece of data that can be obtained from the sources listed above.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Based on the median sale price of $945,000 and the general knowledge of the San Francisco real estate market, it is reasonable to assume that the highest price for a high-rise apartment in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021 could be significantly higher, potentially in the range of $2 million to $3 million. This is because high-rise apartments in prime locations often command premium prices.\n- Given the specific data point from San Francisco Condo Mania, which mentions a high-rise apartment selling for $2,250,000 in 2021, it is plausible that this could be the highest sale price or very close to it. However, further verification is needed to confirm if this is indeed the highest price.\n- **Updated Educated Guess**: Considering the difficulties in accessing the San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office and other primary data sources, the highest sale price data might be more reliably obtained from local real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms. The $2,250,000 sale price remains a strong candidate for the highest price, but verifying this through multiple sources will provide a more accurate answer.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The median sale price provides a baseline understanding of the market, indicating that while the average price was $945,000, there were likely higher-end sales.\n- The specific data point from San Francisco Condo Mania gives a concrete example of a high sale price, which helps narrow down the range for the highest price.\n- Given the premium nature of high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, it is plausible that the highest sale price could be significantly above the median, potentially reaching the upper end of the $2 million to $3 million range.\n- The $2,250,000 sale price from San Francisco Condo Mania is a strong indicator that this could be the highest price, but additional sources should be checked to confirm this.\n- The issues with accessing primary data sources suggest that alternative sources like local real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms might be more reliable for extracting the required data.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**\n   - Use more specific search terms to target real estate reports and transaction records for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n   - Example search terms: \"highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 report\" or \"Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales data.\"\n\n2. **Check Local Real Estate News and Reports**\n   - Search for real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms like CBRE, Knight Frank, or local real estate publications.\n   - Example search terms: \"Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales report\" or \"highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay 2021 news.\"\n\n3. **Use WebSurfer Effectively**\n   - Ensure WebSurfer scrolls through pages and clicks on relevant links to access detailed information.\n   - Use WebSurfer to summarize pages and extract specific data points, such as the highest sale price.\n   - If a CAPTCHA appears, use WebSurfer to navigate through it or try a different source.\n\n4. **Cross-Reference Data**\n   - Verify the extracted data by cross-referencing with at least one additional source to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Save Relevant Data**\n   - Use FileSurfer to save any relevant data or screenshots for record-keeping.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Queries**\n  - Use the search terms: \"highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 report\" or \"Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales data.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Check Local Real Estate News and Reports**\n  - Search for real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms like CBRE, Knight Frank, or local real estate publications.\n  - Extract the highest sale price data.\n\n- **Step 3: Cross-Reference Data**\n  - Verify the extracted data by cross-referencing with at least one additional source.\n\n- **Step 4: Save Relevant Data**\n  - Use FileSurfer to save any relevant data or screenshots for record-keeping.\n\n- **Step 5: Provide the Verified Highest Sale Price**\n  - Present the verified highest sale price to the Assistant for final presentation.\n\n### Immediate Action\n\nPlease search for the highest sale price of high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021 using the following search terms: 'highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 report' or 'Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales data'. Focus on reputable real estate news articles, reports, or official city data sources.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Access Issues with Primary Data Sources**:\n   - The San Francisco Assessor-Recorder’s Office and its data portal (https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Real-Estate-Sales-Data/r8cy-jpz4) returned \"Page Not Found\" errors, preventing us from accessing the necessary real estate transaction data.\n\n2. **Limited Search Scope**:\n   - The search queries used were not sufficiently refined to directly lead to the specific data needed. The results often included general real estate information rather than the specific high sale price for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n\n3. **CAPTCHA and Access Errors**:\n   - Access to Redfin and Zillow was blocked due to CAPTCHA and 403 errors, which prevented us from extracting the required data from these sources.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific and targeted search terms to find real estate reports and transaction records for high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021.\n   - Example search terms: \"highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 report\" or \"Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales data.\"\n\n2. **Check Local Real Estate News and Reports**:\n   - Focus on reputable real estate news articles, reports, or official city data sources.\n   - Example sources: San Francisco Condo Mania, CBRE, Knight Frank, or local real estate publications.\n\n3. **Use WebSurfer Effectively**:\n   - Ensure WebSurfer scrolls through pages, clicks on relevant links, and extracts specific data points, such as the highest sale price.\n   - If a CAPTCHA appears, use WebSurfer to navigate through it or try a different source.\n\n4. **Cross-Reference Data**:\n   - Verify the extracted data by cross-referencing with at least one additional source to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Save Relevant Data**:\n   - Use FileSurfer to save any relevant data or screenshots for record-keeping.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Queries**\n  - Use the search terms: \"highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 report\" or \"Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales data.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Check Local Real Estate News and Reports**\n  - Search for real estate news articles or reports from reputable firms like San Francisco Condo Mania, CBRE, Knight Frank, or local real estate publications.\n  - Extract the highest sale price data.\n\n- **Step 3: Cross-Reference Data**\n  - Verify the extracted data by cross-referencing with at least one additional source.\n\n- **Step 4: Save Relevant Data**\n  - Use FileSurfer to save any relevant data or screenshots for record-keeping.\n\n- **Step 5: Provide the Verified Highest Sale Price**\n  - Present the verified highest sale price to the Assistant for final presentation.\n\n### Immediate Action\n\nPlease search for the highest sale price of high-rise apartments in Mission Bay, San Francisco, in 2021 using the following search terms: 'highest sale price high-rise apartment Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 report' or 'Mission Bay San Francisco 2021 high-rise apartment sales data'.
