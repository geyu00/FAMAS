{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request asks about the year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source for this information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - This information can be found on the USGS website or in their published reports and databases related to wildlife and geographic distribution.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific facts need to be derived from the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, so it is plausible that its range expansion westward would have been documented by wildlife agencies.\n   - Given the historical context, it is likely that such a significant event would be well-documented and available in scientific literature or official records.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** WebSurfer will search the USGS website for information on the first recorded instance of the American Alligator being found west of Texas.\n- **Step 2:** If the information is not directly available on the USGS website, WebSurfer will search additional authoritative sources, such as scientific journals or wildlife agency reports.\n- **Step 3:** Once the relevant information is found, WebSurfer will provide the specific year and any additional context or details.\n- **Step 4:** Assistant will verify the information and format the final answer."}

American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998).Disclaimer:\nThe Nonindigenous Occurrences section of the NAS species profiles has a new structure. The section is now dynamically updated from the NAS database to ensure that it contains the most current and accurate information. Occurrences are summarized in Table 1, alphabetically by state, with years of earliest and most recent observations, and the tally and names of drainages where the species was observed. The table contains hyperlinks to collections tables of specimens based on the states, years, and drainages selected.

The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The alligators spotted in Essex County, New Jersey, may have escaped a lagoon in Military Park, Newark (Anonymous in Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n Perhaps they had been part of a public animal display.\n The \nA. mississippiensis collected from Mesa County, Colorado, escaped from a roadside zoo (Livo et al., 1998), while the one collected from the Colorado River in California had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978).\n Conant (1977) suggested that an animal dealer intentionally established the \nA. mississippiensis population found in the Brownsville area of Cameron County, Texas.\nStatus: All the American alligators found in New York have been collected (Anderson and Habuda, 2001; Anonymous, 2001a, b; Beebe, 2001c; Heaton-Jones, 2001; Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). They are not established in this state nor could they survive the cold winters, and the story of alligators dwelling in New York City sewers is simply a well-entrenched myth (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). One of the alligators found in Union County, New Jersey, was collected; although there is no further word about the success of the 1933 great gator hunt started on the Passaic River in Essex County (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n All \nA. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).\n Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous \nA. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are \"thriving.\" There is no evidence of reproduction.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as \"not well established\" in Arizona.\nImpact of Introduction: There is no evidence that any of the nonindigenous occurrences of American alligators have had any impact on indigenous ecosystems; however, an established population of these massive carnivores in a southwestern state could negatively impact indigenous fauna. The introductions in Oklahoma, and the presumptive introduction in Cameron County, Texas, could compromise the genetic integrity of extant indigenous populations. As mentioned above, the status of indigenous alligators in Oklahoma could be obfuscated, thus creating difficulties when deciding conservation measures and future protective legislation. A large alligator is a potentially dangerous carnivore.\n While attacks on humans are exceedingly rare, they do occur on occasion (Pooley et al., 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Anonymous, 2002).\nRemarks: The taxonomy of A. mississippiensis has been reviewed or summarized by Smith and Smith (1977), King (1989), Ross and Ernst (1994), and Crother et al. (2000). Liner (1994) provides a Spanish vernacular name for the American alligator.  Brisbin et al. (1986), Gibbons and Semlitsch (1991), and Ross and Ernst (1994) provide the best literature reviews of the natural history of alligators. A variety of authors have contributed to or summarized the natural history and biology of American alligators (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973, 1976; Mount, 1975; Lang, 1987, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Vliet, 1989; and a variety of contributions compiled by Webb et al., 1987). Scientific and standard English names follow Crother (2008).Alligator mississippiensis is an aquatic, omnicarnivorous reptile capable of living in many types of waterways, both natural and man-made, and feeding upon almost any fauna it can catch (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Mount, 1975; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Some alligators dig deep holes with connecting dens than can remain filled with water during droughts, thus maintaining an aquatic environment for indigenous fauna (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Grenard, 1991).\n Courtship and mating involves complex visual and auditory displays directed at prospective mates and competitors (McIlhenny, 1935; Lang, 1987, 1989; Vliet, 1989).\n The female buries her hard-shelled eggs in a nest she constructs of dead vegetation and the surrounding muck (McIlhenny, 1935; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Females exhibit varying degrees of parental care by guarding the nest, releasing hatchlings from the nest and eggs, and transporting them to water in her mouth (Kushlan and Simon, 1981; Lang, 1987; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n Young may remain in a protective crèche with the mother and sometimes other adults for a considerable length of time, sometimes exceeding a year (Lang, 1987, 1989; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n American alligators are subject to a variety of state and federal regulations (Levell, 1997); they should not be obtained by anyone before such legislation is understood along the responsibility that goes with keeping them as captives.\nReferences \n(click for full references) Ashton, R.

American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"og:site_name\": \"USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/GreatLakes/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Alligator mississippiensis (American alligator) - Species Profile\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/XIMAGESERVERX/2019/20190613131315.JPG\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Species summary for Alligator mississippiensis (American alligator)\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered and the progress we have made:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request asks about the year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source for this information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, including areas adjacent to the Texas border.\n   - The American Alligator has been known to inhabit areas from coastal North Carolina to southern Florida and the Keys, and it has been recorded as far west as Texas.\n   - The range of the American Alligator has expanded over time, and it is now found in various regions, including parts of Texas.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - This information can be found on the USGS website, in their published reports, or in databases related to wildlife and geographic distribution.\n   - Historical records or reports from state wildlife agencies in New Mexico and Arizona may also contain this information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific facts need to be derived from the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Year of First Recorded Instance**: Based on the available information, it is plausible that the first recorded instance of the American Alligator west of Texas occurred in the late 20th century. This is because the American Alligator was declared fully recovered from habitat loss and hunting in 1987, which suggests that its range might have expanded around this time.\n   - **Documentation by Wildlife Agencies**: Given the historical context and the importance of tracking the distribution of significant wildlife species, it is highly likely that the first recorded instance of the American Alligator west of Texas would be well-documented in official reports or publications from the USGS or state wildlife agencies.\n   - **Potential States**: The states of New Mexico and Arizona are the most likely candidates for the first recorded instance of the American Alligator west of Texas, as they are the closest states to Texas where the alligator might naturally expand its range.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses\n\n- **Year of First Recorded Instance**: The recovery of the American Alligator in 1987 and the subsequent expansion of its range suggest that the first recorded instance west of Texas could have occurred in the late 1980s or early 1990s. This period aligns with the recovery and conservation efforts that led to the population rebound.\n- **Documentation by Wildlife Agencies**: Wildlife agencies, particularly those involved in conservation and management of large reptiles, are likely to have detailed records of such significant events. The USGS, being a federal agency, would have comprehensive data on the distribution of the American Alligator.\n- **Potential States**: New Mexico and Arizona are geographically close to Texas and share similar ecological conditions, making them the most plausible locations for the first recorded instance of the American Alligator west of Texas.\n\nThis updated fact sheet reflects the current state of our knowledge and provides a more focused direction for further research.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Limited Search Results**: The web searches did not yield specific, reliable information about the first recorded instance of the American Alligator west of Texas.\n2. **Lack of Direct Sources**: The information we needed was not directly available on the USGS website or in easily accessible official reports.\n3. **Inefficient Search Queries**: The search queries used were too broad and did not target the specific information we needed effectively.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific and targeted search queries to find the exact information.\n   - Example queries: \"USGS first recorded American Alligator New Mexico\", \"USGS first recorded American Alligator Arizona\", \"USGS historical distribution American Alligator\".\n\n2. **Check Detailed Sections of USGS Website**:\n   - Navigate to specific sections of the USGS website that deal with wildlife distribution and historical records.\n   - Look for publications, reports, and databases that might contain the required information.\n\n3. **Utilize WebSurfer for Deeper Exploration**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate through multiple pages and sections of the USGS website.\n   - Explore sub-pages and detailed reports that might not appear in the initial search results.\n\n4. **Check State Wildlife Agency Websites**:\n   - Visit the official websites of the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish and the Arizona Game and Fish Department.\n   - Look for historical records, annual reports, and wildlife distribution data.\n\n5. **Contact USGS and State Wildlife Agencies**:\n   - Draft and send a more targeted email to the USGS and state wildlife agencies.\n   - Include specific questions and request for historical records or reports.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Perform web searches using the following queries:\n     - \"USGS first recorded American Alligator New Mexico\"\n     - \"USGS first recorded American Alligator Arizona\"\n     - \"USGS historical distribution American Alligator\"\n\n2. **Check Detailed Sections of USGS Website**:\n   - Navigate to the USGS website and explore the following sections:\n     - Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Database\n     - Publications and Reports\n     - Wildlife Distribution Maps\n   - Use WebSurfer to scroll through pages and look for detailed reports or historical data.\n\n3. **Utilize WebSurfer for Deeper Exploration**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate through multiple pages and sections of the USGS website.\n   - Look for sub-pages and detailed reports that might contain the required information.\n   - Example commands:\n     ```sh\n     scroll down\n     click on \"Publications and Reports\"\n     search for \"American Alligator distribution\"\n     ```\n\n4. **Check State Wildlife Agency Websites**:\n   - Visit the official websites of the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish and the Arizona Game and Fish Department.\n   - Look for historical records, annual reports, and wildlife distribution data.\n   - Example commands:\n     ```sh\n     go to https://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/\n     search for \"American Alligator historical records\"\n     go to https://www.azgfd.gov/\n     search for \"American Alligator distribution\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Contact USGS and State Wildlife Agencies**:\n   - Draft and send a more targeted email to the USGS and state wildlife agencies.\n   - Include specific questions and request for historical records or reports.\n   - Example email:\n     **Subject: Inquiry About the First Recorded Instance of American Alligator West of Texas**\n\n     ---\n     \n     Dear [Recipient's Name],\n     \n     I hope this message finds you well.

American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998).\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"og:site_name\": \"USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221\",\n        \"og:title\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/XIMAGESERVERX/2019/20190613131315.JPG\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Species summary for American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis)\",\n        \"Description\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered and the progress we have made:\n\n### Fact Sheet: First Recorded Instance of American Alligator West of Texas\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request asks about the year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n- The source for this information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n- The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, including areas adjacent to the Texas border.\n- The American Alligator has been known to inhabit areas from coastal North Carolina to southern Florida and the Keys, and it has been recorded as far west as Texas.\n- The range of the American Alligator has expanded over time, and it is now found in various regions, including parts of Texas.\n- The American Alligator was declared fully recovered from habitat loss and hunting in 1987, leading to increased monitoring and documentation of its distribution.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n- This information can be found on the USGS website, in their published reports, or in databases related to wildlife and geographic distribution.\n- Historical records or reports from state wildlife agencies in New Mexico and Arizona may also contain this information.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- No specific facts need to be derived from the given information.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Year of First Recorded Instance**: Based on the available information, it is plausible that the first recorded instance of the American Alligator west of Texas occurred in the late 1980s or early 1990s. This is because the American Alligator was declared fully recovered from habitat loss and hunting in 1987, which suggests that its range might have expanded around this time.\n- **Documentation by Wildlife Agencies**: Given the historical context and the importance of tracking the distribution of significant wildlife species, it is highly likely that the first recorded instance of the American Alligator west of Texas would be well-documented in official reports or publications from the USGS or state wildlife agencies.\n- **Potential States**: The states of New Mexico and Arizona are the most likely candidates for the first recorded instance of the American Alligator west of Texas, as they are the closest states to Texas where the alligator might naturally expand its range.\n- **Specific Locations**: Potential locations within New Mexico and Arizona where the American Alligator might have been first recorded include areas near the Rio Grande and other major waterways that could support alligator populations.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses\n\n- **Year of First Recorded Instance**: The recovery of the American Alligator in 1987 and the subsequent expansion of its range suggest that the first recorded instance west of Texas could have occurred in the late 1980s or early 1990s. This period aligns with the recovery and conservation efforts that led to the population rebound.\n- **Documentation by Wildlife Agencies**: Wildlife agencies, particularly those involved in conservation and management of large reptiles, are likely to have detailed records of such significant events. The USGS, being a federal agency, would have comprehensive data on the distribution of the American Alligator.\n- **Potential States**: New Mexico and Arizona are geographically close to Texas and share similar ecological conditions, making them the most plausible locations for the first recorded instance of the American Alligator west of Texas.\n- **Specific Locations**: Major waterways like the Rio Grande in New Mexico and Arizona are likely habitats for alligators due to their size and ability to support the species.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Explore Specific Links**:\n   - Visit the [American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221) and look for detailed historical records or reports.\n   - Review the [The History of Alligators in Texas - TPWD](https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/species/alligator/) for any mentions of alligator sightings outside Texas.\n\n2. **Check State Wildlife Agency Websites**:\n   - Visit the official websites of the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish and the Arizona Game and Fish Department.\n   - Look for historical records, annual reports, and wildlife distribution data.\n\n3. **Contact USGS and State Wildlife Agencies**:\n   - Draft and send a more targeted email to the USGS and state wildlife agencies.\n   - Include specific questions and request for historical records or reports.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to refine our search strategies, explore deeper into the available resources, and directly reach out to the relevant authorities to obtain the specific information needed.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Limited Search Results**: The web searches did not yield specific, reliable information about the first recorded instance of the American Alligator west of Texas.\n2. **Lack of Direct Sources**: The information we needed was not directly available on the USGS website or in easily accessible official reports.\n3. **Inefficient Search Queries**: The search queries used were too broad and did not target the specific information we needed effectively.\n4. **Insufficient Exploration of Detailed Sections**: We did not thoroughly explore detailed sections of the USGS website, such as the Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Database, Publications and Reports, and Wildlife Distribution Maps.\n5. **Missed Potential Sources**: We did not check state wildlife agency websites for historical records or reports.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific and targeted search queries to find the exact information.\n   - Example queries: \"USGS first recorded American Alligator New Mexico\", \"USGS first recorded American Alligator Arizona\", \"USGS historical distribution American Alligator\".\n\n2. **Check Detailed Sections of USGS Website**:\n   - Navigate to the USGS website and explore the following sections:\n     - Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Database\n     - Publications and Reports\n     - Wildlife Distribution Maps\n   - Use WebSurfer to scroll through pages and look for detailed reports or historical data.\n\n3. **Utilize WebSurfer for Deeper Exploration**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate through multiple pages and sections of the USGS website.\n   - Look for sub-pages and detailed reports that might contain the required information.\n   - Example commands:\n     ```sh\n     scroll down\n     click on \"Publications and Reports\"\n     search for \"American Alligator distribution\"\n     ```\n\n4. **Check State Wildlife Agency Websites**:\n   - Visit the official websites of the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish and the Arizona Game and Fish Department.\n   - Look for historical records, annual reports, and wildlife distribution data.\n   - Example commands:\n     ```sh\n     go to https://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/\n     search for \"American Alligator historical records\"\n     go to https://www.azgfd.gov/\n     search for \"American Alligator distribution\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Contact USGS and State Wildlife Agencies**:\n   - Draft and send a more targeted email to the USGS and state wildlife agencies.\n   - Include specific questions and request for historical records or reports.\n   - Example email:\n     **Subject: Inquiry About the First Recorded Instance of American Alligator West of Texas**\n\n     ---\n     \n     Dear [Recipient's Name],\n     \n     I hope this message finds you well.
