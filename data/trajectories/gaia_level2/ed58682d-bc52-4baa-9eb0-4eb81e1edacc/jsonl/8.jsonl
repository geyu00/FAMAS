Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The artist is referred to as the \"King of Pop,\" which is Michael Jackson.\n   - The song in question is the fifth single from Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The title of Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.\n   - The list of singles from that album, specifically the fifth single.\n   - The lyrics of the fifth single, particularly the section leading up to the second chorus.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact position of the second chorus in the song.\n   - The last word before the second chorus based on the lyrics.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Michael Jackson's sixth studio album is likely \"Bad,\" released in 1987.\n   - The fifth single from \"Bad\" is likely \"Smooth Criminal.\"\n   - Based on the typical structure of Michael Jackson's songs, the second chorus is likely to follow a verse or a bridge, but the exact last word would need to be confirmed from the lyrics.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Album and Single**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for Michael Jackson's discography and confirm the sixth studio album and its fifth single.\n  \n- **Find the Lyrics**\n  - Once the fifth single is identified, use WebSurfer to find the lyrics of the song.\n  \n- **Locate the Second Chorus**\n  - Analyze the lyrics to locate the second chorus and identify the last word before it.\n\n- **Verify the Information**\n  - Double-check the identified word by cross-referencing with additional reliable sources if necessary.\n\n- **Report the Result**\n  - Provide the last word before the second chorus as the final answer."}

Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information we have gathered:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The artist is referred to as the \"King of Pop,\" which is Michael Jackson.\n   - The song in question is the fifth single from Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.\n   - Michael Jackson's sixth studio album is \"Thriller,\" released in 1982.\n   - The fifth single from \"Thriller\" is \"Human Nature.\"\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The full lyrics of \"Human Nature,\" particularly the section leading up to the second chorus.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact position of the second chorus in the song.\n   - The last word before the second chorus based on the lyrics.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the typical structure of Michael Jackson's songs, the second chorus is likely to follow a verse or a bridge.\n   - The last word before the second chorus is likely to be a key word from the preceding verse or bridge. Given the lyrics we have seen so far, the last word before the second chorus might be \"way,\" as it appears multiple times in the chorus sections.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- We have confirmed that \"Human Nature\" is the fifth single from Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" album.\n- The lyrics provided in the search results show that the word \"way\" is repeated in the chorus, making it a strong candidate for the last word before the second chorus. However, we need to verify this by finding the full lyrics and identifying the exact position of the second chorus.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Access Issues**: The attempts to access lyrics from AZLyrics were blocked due to their no-index, no-follow policy.\n- **Incomplete Lyrics**: The initial search results provided partial lyrics, but not the full section leading up to the second chorus.\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: The search and navigation through the web pages did not consistently lead to the full lyrics, causing delays and incomplete information.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Use Reliable Sources Directly**: Focus on using Genius or Musixmatch directly, as they are known for providing full and accurate lyrics.\n- **Direct Linking**: Instead of searching through multiple results, directly navigate to the specific lyrics page on Genius or Musixmatch.\n- **Extract Full Lyrics**: Ensure the full lyrics are extracted, including the section leading up to the second chorus.\n- **Identify the Last Word**: Carefully analyze the lyrics to identify the last word before the second chorus.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Navigate to Genius or Musixmatch Directly**:\n   - Use the direct link to the lyrics page for \"Human Nature\" by Michael Jackson on Genius or Musixmatch.\n   - For example, use the link: https://genius.com/Michael-jackson-human-nature-lyrics\n\n2. **Extract Full Lyrics**:\n   - Scroll down the page to ensure the full lyrics are visible.\n   - Copy the full lyrics and provide them here.\n\n3. **Identify the Section Leading to the Second Chorus**:\n   - Analyze the lyrics to locate the second chorus.\n   - Identify the last word before the second chorus.\n\n4. **Report the Result**:\n   - Provide the last word before the second chorus as the final answer.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Direct Links**: Use direct links to avoid search result pages that may not lead to the full lyrics.\n- **Scroll and Verify**: Ensure the entire lyrics are visible and complete before extracting the relevant section.\n- **Double-Check**: Cross-reference the identified section with the structure of the song to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Action:\nCan you navigate to the direct link for the lyrics of \"Human Nature\" by Michael Jackson on Genius and extract the full lyrics?

Something had happened at school and it just inspired me. I wrote the song while we were mixing “Africa” and was just tinkering on the piano and wrote ‘Human Nature.’ It was one of a batch of three songs I had written in a certain time period. I had written the lyrics, which were the same verse I was singing over and over again. I had the ‘why, why’ chorus with the slap echo. Like most of my songs it was an unfinished song.\nQuincy had been asking David for songs and he was sending a messenger almost every day to David’s house – where I was living at the time – to pick up anything David was working on. And so David was sending him stuff. One time, he had gotten a call that the messenger was on his way and he called down to me and told me to throw something we’d been working on onto a cassette. I didn’t have any blank cassettes, so I took a cassette that had ‘Human Nature’ on one side and turned the B-side over, rewound it and put on these two songs of David’s. and then gave them to the messenger.\nJones played both sides of the cassette and was excited about “Human Nature.” Quincy called David the next day and was raving about this tune that went ‘why, why.’ It took David half an hour to tell Quincy that it wasn’t his song! But the song was incomplete lyric-wise and Jones asked Porcaro to finish them. Porcaro recalls: “I forced myself to write the lyrics and Quincy was less than thrilled with them and he asked me if I would mind if he brought in John Bettis to finish them. I was completely thrilled with what John did with the lyrics.\nKeyboardist/Emulator Michael Boddicker:\nThat was Steve Porcaro’s track. He used a Yamaha CS-80 with glide (chromatic instead of portamento) at the head — it’s got that nice little CS fuzz around the sound. That fuzz was also part of a multi-layered sound I used for the four-chord basic string vamp on “Billie Jean” — Michael Jackson himself played that part on a CS-80 in one take. No punches. No repairs. No sequencers or time correction. Seven minutes. Perfect performance.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
