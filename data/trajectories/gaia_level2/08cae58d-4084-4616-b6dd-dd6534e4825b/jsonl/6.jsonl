{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request asks about the first year Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n   - The source for this information is specified as Google Finance.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year when Apple stock first went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n   - This information can be found on Google Finance by looking at historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are necessary for this request, as the information can be directly obtained from historical stock price data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge of Apple's stock history, it is likely that this event occurred sometime in the early 2000s, given the company's significant growth during that period. However, this is a guess and needs verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to Google Finance and search for historical stock prices of Apple (AAPL).\n- **Data Extraction**: Have WebSurfer locate the specific year when Apple stock first went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n- **Verification**: Ensure the data is accurate by cross-referencing with the historical price chart or a detailed price history table.\n- **Report**: Provide the year identified by WebSurfer as the answer to the request."}

It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade.\nWikipediaCEO\nTim CookFounded\nApr 1, 1976\nHeadquarters\nCupertino\n, \nCalifornia\nUnited States\nWebsite\napple.com\nEmployees\n164,000\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>\n\nI will now scroll up further to reach the historical price data chart.\n\nI scrolled up one page in the browser.\n\nThe web browser is open to the page [AAPL $211.16 (▼0.59%) Apple Inc | Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ?window=MAX).\nThe viewport shows 28% of the webpage, and is positioned at the top of the page\nThe following text is visible in the viewport:\n\nFinance\nSign inMarkets\nUS\nEurope\nAsia\nCurrencies\nCrypto\nFutures\nDow Jones\n44,371.51\n-0.63%\n-279.13\nS&P 500\n6,259.75\n-0.33%\n-20.71\nNasdaq\n20,585.53\n-0.22%\n-45.14\nRussell\n2,234.83\n-1.26%\n-28.58\nVIX\n16.40\n+\n3.93%\n+\n0.62\nHome\nAAPL\n • \nNASDAQ\nApple Inc\nFollow\nShare\n$211.16\n263,850.00%\n+\n211.08\nMAX\nJul 11\n, \n8:30:00 PM UTC-4\n · \nUSD\n · \nNASDAQ\n · \nDisclaimer1D\n5D\n1M\n6M\nYTD\n1Y\n5Y\nMAX\n1990\n2000\n2010\n2020\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nsearch\nCompare to\nAmazon.com Inc\n$225.02AMZN\n249,922.22%\nNVIDIA Corp\n$164.92NVDA\n412,200.00%\nTesla Inc\n$313.51TSLA\n24,392.97%\nMicrosoft Corp\n$503.32MSFT\n503,220.00%\nPalantir Technologies Inc\n$142.10PLTR\n1,444.57%\nInvesco QQQ Trust, Series 1\n$554.20QQQ\n946.25%\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc Class B\n$475.86BRK.B\n1,882.75%\nNetflix Inc\n$1,245.11NFLX\nTop news\nequalizer\nMost active\nStock\nUS listed security\nUS headquartered\nPrevious close\n$212.41\nDay range\n$209.86\n - \n$212.13\nYear range\n$169.21\n - \n$260.09\nMarket cap\n3.15T\nUSD\nAvg Volume\n54.54M\nP/E ratio\n32.95\nDividend yield\n0.49%\nPrimary exchange\nNASDAQ\nAbout\n\nApple Inc. is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley.
