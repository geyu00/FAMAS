To answer this request we have assembled the following team: Assistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills. ComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks). FileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files. WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded. Here is an initial fact sheet to consider: Certainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and refined educated guesses: ### Fact Sheet 1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS** - The series must have more than 1 season. - Ted Danson must have starred in the series. - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US). - The series must be rated according to Rotten Tomatoes. 2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP** - A comprehensive list of all TV series starring Ted Danson. - The number of seasons for each of these series. - The Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each of these series. - The availability of these series on Amazon Prime Video (US). 3. **FACTS TO DERIVE** - Determine which series meet all the criteria: more than 1 season, starring Ted Danson, available on Amazon Prime Video (US), and their respective Rotten Tomatoes ratings. - Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating among those that meet the criteria. 4. **EDUCATED GUESSES** - **Series with Multiple Seasons**: - **Becker**: 6 seasons - **Bored to Death**: 3 seasons - **Cheers**: 11 seasons - **CSI: Crime Scene Investigation**: 15 seasons - **Damages**: 5 seasons - **Casual**: 3 seasons - **Somerset**: 7 seasons - **Less Popular Series**: - \"Bored to Death\" and \"Help Me Help You\" are less well-known and had shorter runs, which might indicate lower ratings. - \"Casual\" had mixed reviews and ran for multiple seasons, making it a potential candidate for the worst-rated series. - \"Ink\" was a short-lived series but had some positive reviews, so it's worth checking its Rotten Tomatoes score. - **Established Series**: - \"Becker\" and \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" are longer-running series and are likely to have more consistent ratings, but they should still be checked for their Rotten Tomatoes scores and availability on Amazon Prime Video (US). **Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:** - **\"Bored to Death\"** and **\"Help Me Help You\"** are less well-known and had shorter runs, which might indicate lower ratings. - **\"Casual\"** had mixed reviews and ran for multiple seasons, making it a potential candidate for the worst-rated series. - **\"Ink\"** was a short-lived series but had some positive reviews, so it's worth checking its Rotten Tomatoes score. - **\"Becker\"** and **\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"** are more established and popular, but verifying their ratings and availability is still important to ensure accuracy. ### Next Steps 1. **Extract Series Information**: - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Ranker page and extract the names of all TV series starring Ted Danson. - **WebSurfer**: Note the number of seasons for each series. 2. **Filter by Number of Seasons**: - **WebSurfer**: Filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season. 3. **Check Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**: - **WebSurfer**: For each series with more than 1 season, navigate to Rotten Tomatoes and find the series rating. - **WebSurfer**: Record the Rotten Tomatoes rating for each series. 4. **Check Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**: - **WebSurfer**: For each series with more than 1 season, navigate to Amazon Prime Video (US) and check if the series is available. - **WebSurfer**: Record the availability status for each series. 5. **Compile and Analyze Data**: - **WebSurfer**: Create a table or list of series that meet all criteria (more than 1 season, starring Ted Danson, available on Amazon Prime Video, and have a Rotten Tomatoes rating). - **WebSurfer**: Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating among those that meet the criteria. 6. **Report Findings**: - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the findings and provide the name of the worst-rated series that meets all the criteria. ### Example Table | Series Name | Number of Seasons | Rotten Tomatoes Rating | Available on Amazon Prime Video (US) | |--------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------| | Becker | 6 | 78% | Yes | | Bored to Death | 3 | 80% | Yes | | Cheers | 11 | 97% | Yes | | CSI: Crime Scene Investigation | 15 | 74% | Yes | | Casual | 3 | 72% | Yes | | Damages | 5 | 82% | Yes | | Somerset | 7 | N/A | No | | Help Me Help You | 1 | N/A | No | | Ink | 1 | N/A | No | ### Final Step - **WebSurfer**: Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating from the compiled table and report the findings.
