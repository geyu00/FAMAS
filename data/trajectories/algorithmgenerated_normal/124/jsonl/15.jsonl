{"agent": "Validation_Expert", "content": "It seems that the code executed successfully, but the output returned an empty list, indicating that no management team information was extracted from the FuboTV website. This could be due to several reasons, such as:\n\n1. The webpage structure may not match the assumptions made in the code.\n2. The relevant information might not be present on the specific URL used.\n3. There may be restrictions on web scraping for that page.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo address this issue, I suggest the following adjustments:\n\n1. **Check the URL**: Ensure that the URL used is correct and that the management team information is indeed available there.\n2. **Inspect the HTML Structure**: Manually inspect the HTML layout of the website to determine the appropriate tags and classes to use for scraping the required information.\n3. **Use Alternative Sources**: If the information is not accessible via scraping, consider checking other reliable sources such as company press releases or news articles.\n\nWould you like me to help you refine the scraping code based on a different approach, or should we look for information in alternative sources?"}
