Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The language being used is Tizin.\n   - Basic sentence structure in Tizin: Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n   - \"Pa\" is the nominative form for oneself.\n   - \"Mato\" is the accusative form for oneself.\n   - \"Sing\" is the genitive form for oneself.\n   - The root verb for an intense like is \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Maktay\" is used in the present tense.\n   - \"Tay\" is used in the preterit past tense.\n   - \"Aktay\" is used in the imperfect past tense.\n   - \"Maktay\" translates better as \"is pleasing to\".\n   - The word for apples in Tizin is \"Apple\" (nominative), \"Zapple\" (accusative), and \"Izapple\" (genitive).\n   - The sentence to translate is \"I like apples\".\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - No specific facts need to be looked up as all necessary information is provided in the request.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The correct form of the verb \"Maktay\" to use in the present tense.\n   - The correct placement of \"Apple\" (direct object) and \"Pa\" (subject) in the sentence structure.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The sentence \"I like apples\" will likely be structured as \"Maktay Zapple Pa\" based on the given sentence structure and the roles of the words.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Confirm the sentence structure and verb conjugation rules from the given information.\n- Construct the sentence \"I like apples\" in Tizin using the provided grammar and vocabulary.\n- Verify the constructed sentence for accuracy based on the given rules.\n- Present the final translation to the user.\n\nGiven the straightforward nature of the task and the complete information provided, there is no need to involve the ComputerTerminal, FileSurfer, or WebSurfer. The Assistant can handle the translation directly."}
