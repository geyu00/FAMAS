The American series premiered on May 31, 2000, on \nCBS. It is hosted by \nJeff Probst, who is also an \nexecutive producer along with \nMark Burnett and the original creator, Parsons. \nSurvivor places a group of people in an isolated location, where they must provide food, fire, and shelter for themselves. The contestants compete in challenges including testing the contestants' physical abilities like running and swimming or their mental abilities like puzzles and endurance challenges for rewards and \nimmunity from elimination. The contestants are progressively eliminated from the game as they are voted out by their fellow contestants until only two or three remain. At that point, the contestants who were eliminated vote for the winner. They are given the title of \"Sole Survivor\" and are awarded the grand prize of $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 in \nWinners at War). \nThe American version has been very successful. From the \n2000–01 through the \n2005–06 television seasons, its first 11 seasons (competitions) rated among the top 10 most-watched shows. It is commonly considered the leader of American \nreality TV because it was the first \nhighly rated and profitable reality show on \nbroadcast television in the U.S., and is considered one of the best shows of the 2000s (decade).\n[1][2][3] The series has been nominated for 63 \nEmmy Awards, including winning for Outstanding Sound Mixing in 2001, Outstanding Special Class Program in 2002, and was subsequently nominated four times for \nOutstanding Reality-Competition Program when the category was introduced in 2003. Probst won the award for \nOutstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Survivor (American TV series)\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series)\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q28856068\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q28856068\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2007-11-16T16:45:01Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-11T12:12:19Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/400px-Survivor.borneo.logo.png\",\n        \"headline\": \"American version of the international Survivor reality competition television franchise\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/400px-Survivor.borneo.logo.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"400\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Survivor (American TV series) - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Sixteen or more players, split between two or more \"tribes\", are taken to a remote isolated location (usually in a tropical climate) and are forced to live off the land with meager supplies for 39 days (42 in \nThe Australian Outback, 26 in post-\nCOVID seasons).\n[a] Frequent physical and mental challenges are used to pit the teams against each other for rewards, such as food or luxuries, or for \"immunity\", forcing the other tribe to attend \"Tribal Council\", where they must vote off one of their tribemates. \nSignaling the halfway point in the game, survivors from both tribes come together to live as one, making it to the \"merge\". At this point, survivors will compete against each other to win individual immunity; winning immunity prevents that player from being voted out at Tribal Council. Most players that are voted out after the merge form the game's \"jury\". Once the group gets down to two or three people, a Final Tribal Council is held where the remaining players plead their case to the jury members. The jury then votes for which player should be considered the \"Sole Survivor\" and win the show's grand prize. In all seasons for the American version (excluding \nSurvivor: Winners at War whose winner won $2 million), this has included a $1-million prize in addition to the Sole Survivor title; some seasons (particularly earlier seasons) have included additional prizes offered during the game, such as a car, as well as fan-favorite prizes awarded at the finale. All contestants are paid on a sliding scale based on the order they were voted out: the first player voted out has been given \nUS$2,500 and the amount increases from there. Some of the seasons that have featured returning players have increased these amounts: \nSurvivor: All-Stars featured payouts starting at \nUS$5,000, while \nWinners at War had a minimum \nUS$25,000 payout. All players are offered \nUS$10,000 for participating in the finale show.\n[9]\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

All players are offered \nUS$10,000 for participating in the finale show.\n[9]The American version has introduced numerous modifications, or \"twists\", on the core rules in order to keep the players on their toes and to prevent players from relying on strategies that succeeded in prior seasons. These changes have included tribal switches, seasons starting with more than two tribes, the ability to exile a player from a tribe for a short time on \"Exile Island\", hidden immunity idols that players can use to save themselves or others at Tribal Council, special voting powers which can be used to influence the result at Tribal Council, the chance to return to regular gameplay after elimination through \"Redemption Island\", \"Edge of Extinction\" or \"The Outcast Tribe\" twists, and special advantages to help players in the game like an extra vote, the ability to steal a vote, a idol nullifier, and a final four fire-making challenge as of season 35. \nSeries overview[edit]See also: \nList of Survivor (American TV series) episodes (seasons 1–20), \nList of Survivor (American TV series) episodes (seasons 21–40), and \nList of Survivor (American TV series) episodes (seasons 41–present)The United States version is produced by \nMark Burnett and hosted by \nJeff Probst, who also serves as an executive producer. Each competition is called a season, has a unique name, and lasts from 13 to 16 episodes. The first season, \nSurvivor: Borneo, was broadcast as a summer replacement show in 2000. Starting with the third season, \nSurvivor: Africa, there have been two seasons aired during each American television season.\n[b] Starting with the 41st season, no subtitle has been used in promotion of the season. Instead, the show began following a number format similar to \nBig Brother and \nThe Amazing Race. \nIn the first season, there was a 75-person crew.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAs of August 2023, who is the only winner of the US version of Survivor to be born in the month of May?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question is asking about the US version of Survivor.\n   - The winner must have been born in the month of May.\n   - The time frame is as of August 2023.\n   - We have confirmed the birth months of several US Survivor winners:\n     - Richard Hatch: September\n     - Ethan Zohn: November\n     - J.T. Thomas: June\n     - Todd Herzog: January\n     - Parvati Shallow: September\n     - Sandra Diaz-Twine: July\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of all winners of the US version of Survivor.\n   - The birth months of the remaining winners.\n   - Sources: Official Survivor website, Wikipedia pages for Survivor seasons and winners, and possibly interviews or biographical information from news articles or fan sites.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the list of winners with their birth months to identify those born in May.\n   - Confirming that only one winner was born in May.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the verified birth months of several winners, it is becoming clearer that the winner born in May might be less well-known or less frequently mentioned in easily accessible sources.\n   - Given the specificity of the question and the fact that we have not found any May-born winners yet, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the May-born winner might be from a more recent season or less prominently featured in common biographies.\n   - One potential candidate to check is **Boston Rob Mariano**, as he is a prominent figure in Survivor history, but his birth month is not immediately known from the sources we have checked so far.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Perform a web search for the birth month of Boston Rob Mariano.\n- Continue checking the birth months of other US Survivor winners, particularly those from more recent seasons, to ensure we have a comprehensive list.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Context Length Exceeded**: The web surfing process repeatedly failed due to exceeding the maximum context length allowed by the model (32768 tokens). This indicates that the conversation history or the accumulated data being processed was too large.\n- **Redundant Actions**: The repeated attempts to visit the same pages and perform the same actions without addressing the underlying issue of context length led to continuous failures.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Reset Context**:\n   - Clear the current conversation history to start fresh and avoid exceeding the context length.\n   - Ensure that each step is concise and focused to prevent the accumulation of large amounts of data.\n\n2. **Efficient Web Searches**:\n   - Perform targeted web searches for the birth months of specific US Survivor winners, starting with those who have not been checked yet.\n   - Use direct search queries to minimize the number of steps and reduce the risk of context length issues.\n\n3. **Check Remaining Winners**:\n   - Start with Boston Rob Mariano, as he is a prominent figure and his birth month is not yet known.\n   - Continue with other notable winners whose birth months are unknown, such as:\n     - Tony Vlachos\n     - Yul Kwon\n     - Tyson Apostol\n     - Others as needed\n\n4. **Cross-Reference and Verify**:\n   - Once the birth months of the remaining winners are found, cross-reference the list to identify the winner born in May.\n   - Verify that only one winner was born in May.\n\n5. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Once the winner born in May is identified, provide the final answer to the request.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Clear Current Conversation History**:\n   - Reset the conversation to start fresh.\n\n2. **Perform Targeted Web Searches**:\n   - **Action**: Perform a web search for \"Boston Rob Mariano birth month\".\n   - **Action**: Perform a web search for \"Tony Vlachos birth month\".\n   - **Action**: Perform a web search for \"Yul Kwon birth month\".\n   - **Action**: Perform a web search for \"Tyson Apostol birth month\".\n   - **Action**: Perform web searches for other notable winners as needed.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference and Verify**:\n   - **Action**: Compile a list of all verified birth months.\n   - **Action**: Identify the winner born in May and verify that they are the only one.\n\n4. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - **Action**: Provide the name of the winner born in May.\n\n### Execution\n\nLet's start by performing a web search for \"Boston Rob Mariano birth month\"."}
