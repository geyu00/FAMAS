It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and our current progress:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The reference point is the end of 2022.\n   - The direct link to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard is currently inaccessible due to an \"Access Denied\" error.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n   - The text, specifically the last line of the rhyme, under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo.\n   - An archived version of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page as of the end of 2022.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identifying which flavor is considered the oldest based on the information available in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard or an archived version.\n   - Determining the exact location of the headstone in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard likely contains detailed information about each retired flavor, including photos and rhymes.\n   - The oldest flavor might be one of the original flavors introduced by Ben & Jerry's, such as Chunky Monkey or Cherry Garcia, but this needs verification.\n   - The last line of the rhyme might be a common phrase used in Ben & Jerry's flavor descriptions, but it could also be unique to the specific flavor.\n   - Given the access issues with the current Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page, an archived version from the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) or another reliable source might be the best alternative to find the required information.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Archived Version**: Since the direct link to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard is inaccessible, an archived version from the Wayback Machine or another reliable source is a logical next step. This will help us bypass the access issues and still find the necessary information.\n- **Original Flavors**: While Chunky Monkey and Cherry Garcia are well-known and early flavors, verifying which one is the oldest or if there is an even older flavor will require checking the archived page or another detailed source.\n- **Common Phrases**: The last line of the rhyme could indeed be a common phrase used across multiple flavors, but it's also possible that each flavor has a unique rhyme. Checking the archived page will help confirm this.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Access Issues**: The direct link to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard resulted in an \"Access Denied\" error, preventing us from directly accessing the required information.\n- **Lack of Alternative Sources**: We did not immediately seek out alternative sources, such as archived versions of the page, which could have provided the necessary information.\n\n### New Plan\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for an archived version of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page as of the end of 2022 using the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine).\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the archived page and locate the section for the oldest flavor.\n- **WebSurfer**: Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and look for any headstones visible in the background.\n- **WebSurfer**: Zoom in or enhance the image to clearly read the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone in the background.\n- **WebSurfer**: Extract and provide the last line of the rhyme.\n- **Assistant**: Verify the extracted information and format the final answer.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Search for Archived Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) and search for the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page as of the end of 2022.\n2. **Locate Oldest Flavor Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once on the archived page, locate the section for the oldest flavor.\n3. **Identify Background Headstone**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and look for any headstones visible in the background.\n4. **Zoom In and Read Rhyme**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Zoom in or enhance the image to clearly read the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone in the background.\n5. **Extract and Provide Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the last line of the rhyme and provide it.\n6. **Verify and Format Answer**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the extracted information and format the final answer.\n\nBy focusing on the archived version of the page, we can avoid the access issues and ensure we have the necessary information to complete the task."}

Despite their demise, these flavors remain part of the company’s legacy. \nA Tourist Attraction With A Purpose: The Flavor Graveyard draws over 350,000 visitors annually, making it a popular stop for ice cream lovers. \nThe site not only entertains but also strengthens the emotional connection between the brand and its fans. \nVisitors can reminisce about their favorite discontinued flavors while enjoying a scoop of Ben & Jerry’s current offerings at the nearby factory.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and our current progress:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The reference point is the end of 2022.\n   - The direct link to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard is currently inaccessible due to an \"Access Denied\" error.\n   - The Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard was established in 1997 with the first four flavors: Dastardly Mash, Economic Crunch, Ethan Almond, and Tuskegee Chunk.\n   - The flavor graveyard has grown to include more than 40 retired flavors over the years.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n   - The text, specifically the last line of the rhyme, under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo.\n   - An archived version of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page as of the end of 2022.\n   - High-resolution images of the flavor graveyard that clearly show the oldest flavor's headstone and any headstones in the background.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identifying which flavor is considered the oldest based on the information available in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard or an archived version.\n   - Determining the exact location of the headstone in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard likely contains detailed information about each retired flavor, including photos and rhymes.\n   - The oldest flavor might be one of the original flavors introduced by Ben & Jerry's, such as Chunky Monkey or Cherry Garcia, but this needs verification.\n   - The last line of the rhyme might be a common phrase used in Ben & Jerry's flavor descriptions, but it could also be unique to the specific flavor.\n   - Given the access issues with the current Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page, an archived version from the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) or another reliable source might be the best alternative to find the required information.\n   - The original flavors from 1997, such as Dastardly Mash, Economic Crunch, Ethan Almond, and Tuskegee Chunk, are strong candidates for being among the oldest flavors in the graveyard.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Archived Version**: Since the direct link to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard is inaccessible, an archived version from the Wayback Machine or another reliable source is a logical next step. This will help us bypass the access issues and still find the necessary information.\n- **Original Flavors**: The flavors Dastardly Mash, Economic Crunch, Ethan Almond, and Tuskegee Chunk were among the first to be included in the flavor graveyard in 1997, making them strong candidates for being the oldest flavors.\n- **Common Phrases**: The last line of the rhyme could indeed be a common phrase used across multiple flavors, but it's also possible that each flavor has a unique rhyme. Checking the archived page will help confirm this.\n- **High-Resolution Images**: High-resolution images of the flavor graveyard can provide clear views of the headstones, making it easier to read the text and identify the specific headstone in the background.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Search for Archived Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) and search for the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page as of the end of 2022.\n2. **Locate Oldest Flavor Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once on the archived page, locate the section for the oldest flavor.\n3. **Identify Background Headstone**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and look for any headstones visible in the background.\n4. **Zoom In and Read Rhyme**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Zoom in or enhance the image to clearly read the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone in the background.\n5. **Extract and Provide Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the last line of the rhyme and provide it.\n6. **Verify and Format Answer**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the extracted information and format the final answer.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Search for Archived Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) and search for the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page as of the end of 2022.\n2. **Locate Oldest Flavor Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once on the archived page, locate the section for the oldest flavor.\n3. **Identify Background Headstone**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and look for any headstones visible in the background.\n4. **Zoom In and Read Rhyme**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Zoom in or enhance the image to clearly read the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone in the background.\n5. **Extract and Provide Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the last line of the rhyme and provide it.\n6. **Verify and Format Answer**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the extracted information and format the final answer.\n\nBy focusing on the archived version of the page and high-resolution images, we can ensure we have the necessary information to complete the task.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Access Issues**: The direct link to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard resulted in an \"Access Denied\" error, preventing us from directly accessing the required information.\n- **Ineffective Image Search**: The image search did not yield high-resolution images that clearly showed the oldest flavor's headstone and the headstone in the background.\n- **Lack of Detailed Archival Search**: We did not thoroughly search for an archived version of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page as of the end of 2022.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Search for Archived Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) and search for the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page as of the end of 2022.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the exact date is not available, find the closest archived version from late 2022.\n\n2. **Locate Oldest Flavor Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once on the archived page, locate the section for the oldest flavor.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n\n3. **Identify Background Headstone**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for any headstones visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Zoom in or enhance the image to clearly read the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone in the background.\n\n4. **Extract and Provide Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the last line of the rhyme and provide it.\n\n5. **Verify and Format Answer**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the extracted information and format the final answer.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) and search for the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page as of the end of 2022.\n- **WebSurfer**: If the exact date is not available, find the closest archived version from late 2022.\n- **WebSurfer**: Once on the archived page, locate the section for the oldest flavor.\n- **WebSurfer**: Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n- **WebSurfer**: Look for any headstones visible in the background of the photo.\n- **WebSurfer**: Zoom in or enhance the image to clearly read the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone in the background.\n- **WebSurfer**: Extract the last line of the rhyme and provide it.\n- **Assistant**: Verify the extracted information and format the final answer."}

Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and our current progress:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The reference point is the end of 2022.\n   - The direct link to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard is currently inaccessible due to an \"Access Denied\" error.\n   - The Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard was established in 1997 with the first four flavors: Dastardly Mash, Economic Crunch, Ethan Almond, and Tuskegee Chunk.\n   - The flavor graveyard has grown to include more than 40 retired flavors over the years.\n   - Initial searches for high-resolution images of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard have not yielded the specific photo needed.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n   - The text, specifically the last line of the rhyme, under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo.\n   - An archived version of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page as of the end of 2022.\n   - High-resolution images of the flavor graveyard that clearly show the oldest flavor's headstone and any headstones in the background.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identifying which flavor is considered the oldest based on the information available in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard or an archived version.\n   - Determining the exact location of the headstone in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard likely contains detailed information about each retired flavor, including photos and rhymes.\n   - The oldest flavor might be one of the original flavors introduced by Ben & Jerry's, such as Dastardly Mash, Economic Crunch, Ethan Almond, or Tuskegee Chunk, but this needs verification.\n   - The last line of the rhyme might be a common phrase used in Ben & Jerry's flavor descriptions, but it could also be unique to the specific flavor.\n   - Given the access issues with the current Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page, an archived version from the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) or another reliable source might be the best alternative to find the required information.\n   - High-resolution images of the flavor graveyard can provide clear views of the headstones, making it easier to read the text and identify the specific headstone in the background.\n   - The Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page might have been updated or restructured, which could explain why the exact URL is not available in the Wayback Machine.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Archived Version**: Since the direct link to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard is inaccessible, an archived version from the Wayback Machine or another reliable source is a logical next step. This will help us bypass the access issues and still find the necessary information.\n- **Original Flavors**: The flavors Dastardly Mash, Economic Crunch, Ethan Almond, and Tuskegee Chunk were among the first to be included in the flavor graveyard in 1997, making them strong candidates for being the oldest flavors.\n- **Common Phrases**: The last line of the rhyme could indeed be a common phrase used across multiple flavors, but it's also possible that each flavor has a unique rhyme. Checking the archived page will help confirm this.\n- **High-Resolution Images**: High-resolution images of the flavor graveyard can provide clear views of the headstones, making it easier to read the text and identify the specific headstone in the background.\n- **Page Structure**: The Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page might have been updated or restructured, which could explain why the exact URL is not available in the Wayback Machine. We should try searching for similar pages or broader terms related to the flavor graveyard.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Search for Archived Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) and search for the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page as of the end of 2022.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the exact URL is not available, try searching for similar pages or broader terms related to the flavor graveyard.\n2. **Locate Oldest Flavor Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once on the archived page, locate the section for the oldest flavor.\n3. **Identify Background Headstone**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and look for any headstones visible in the background.\n4. **Zoom In and Read Rhyme**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Zoom in or enhance the image to clearly read the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone in the background.\n5. **Extract and Provide Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the last line of the rhyme and provide it.\n6. **Verify and Format Answer**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the extracted information and format the final answer.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Search for Archived Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) and search for the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page as of the end of 2022.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the exact URL is not available, try searching for similar pages or broader terms related to the flavor graveyard.\n2. **Locate Oldest Flavor Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once on the archived page, locate the section for the oldest flavor.\n3. **Identify Background Headstone**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and look for any headstones visible in the background.\n4. **Zoom In and Read Rhyme**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Zoom in or enhance the image to clearly read the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone in the background.\n5. **Extract and Provide Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the last line of the rhyme and provide it.\n6. **Verify and Format Answer**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the extracted information and format the final answer.\n\nBy focusing on the archived version of the page and high-resolution images, we can ensure we have the necessary information to complete the task.\n\n### Next Step\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) and search for the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page as of the end of 2022. If the exact URL is not available, try searching for similar pages or broader terms related to the flavor graveyard.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Inaccessible Direct Link**: The direct link to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard resulted in an \"Access Denied\" error, preventing us from directly accessing the required information.\n- **Limited Results from Web Searches**: Initial web searches for high-resolution images of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard did not yield the specific photo needed.\n- **No Archived Version Found**: Searches in the Wayback Machine did not return any captures for the exact URL of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page from late 2022.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Search for Similar Pages in the Wayback Machine**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) and search for the Ben & Jerry's website (`https://www.benjerry.com`) for the year 2022.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Browse through the archived versions to find any pages related to the flavor graveyard, even if they are not the exact URL.\n\n2. **Use Broader Search Terms**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using broader terms such as \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022\" to find any articles, blogs, or media coverage that might have high-resolution images or detailed descriptions of the graveyard.\n\n3. **Check Social Media and Official Channels**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for Ben & Jerry's official social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) for posts or stories from 2022 that might feature the flavor graveyard.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check Ben & Jerry's official blog or news section for any articles or updates about the flavor graveyard from 2022.\n\n4. **Contact Ben & Jerry's Customer Support (If Possible)**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Although we cannot contact external people, check if there is a way to submit a support request on Ben & Jerry's website for information about the flavor graveyard.\n\n5. **Analyze Found Images and Text**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once a relevant image or page is found, analyze it to locate the oldest flavor's headstone and the headstone in the background.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Zoom in or enhance the image to clearly read the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone in the background.\n\n6. **Extract and Provide Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the last line of the rhyme and provide it.\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the extracted information and format the final answer.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) and search for the Ben & Jerry's website (`https://www.benjerry.com`) for the year 2022.\n- **WebSurfer**: Browse through the archived versions to find any pages related to the flavor graveyard.\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using broader terms such as \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022\" to find any articles, blogs, or media coverage.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for Ben & Jerry's official social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) for posts or stories from 2022.\n- **WebSurfer**: Check Ben & Jerry's official blog or news section for any articles or updates about the flavor graveyard from 2022.\n- **WebSurfer**: Once a relevant image or page is found, analyze it to locate the oldest flavor's headstone and the headstone in the background.\n- **WebSurfer**: Zoom in or enhance the image to clearly read the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone in the background.\n- **WebSurfer**: Extract the last line of the rhyme and provide it.\n- **Assistant**: Verify the extracted information and format the final answer."}
