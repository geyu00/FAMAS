It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is for a GFF3 file related to beluga whales.\n   - The file must have been the most recent as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The Ensembl database contains a genome assembly for the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) with the assembly name ASM228892v3 (GCA_002288925.3).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific location within the Ensembl database where the GFF3 file for the beluga whale is stored.\n   - The most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales available as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The exact URL or link to the GFF3 file.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file is likely to be found in the 'Downloads' section of the Ensembl page for the beluga whale genome.\n   - The file might be part of a larger dataset or project focused on marine mammals or beluga whales specifically.\n   - Given that the current Ensembl release is 114 (May 2025), the GFF3 file for the beluga whale as of 20/10/2020 might be available in an archived version of the Ensembl database or a previous release.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The Ensembl database is a primary source for genomic data, and the presence of the beluga whale genome assembly (ASM228892v3) suggests that the GFF3 file is likely available there.\n- Since the current Ensembl release is much later than 20/10/2020, it is reasonable to assume that the most recent GFF3 file as of that date might be in an older release or an archived version of the database.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Navigate to the 'Downloads' section of the Ensembl page for the beluga whale genome (https://mart.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index).\n- Look for the GFF3 file and verify if it is the most recent version as of 20/10/2020.\n- If not found, check for archived versions or previous releases of the Ensembl database.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Navigation Issue:** The WebSurfer navigated to the wrong page when clicking the 'Downloads' link, leading to a page about accessing Ensembl data in general rather than the specific downloads for the beluga whale genome.\n- **Lack of Verification:** There was no verification step to ensure that the correct page was reached after clicking the 'Downloads' link.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Navigate to the Correct Page:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate back to the beluga whale genome page (https://mart.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index).\n  - Click on the 'Downloads' section to ensure it leads to the specific downloads for the beluga whale genome.\n\n- **Verify the Correct Page:**\n  - Check the URL and page content to ensure it is the correct downloads page for the beluga whale genome.\n\n- **Locate the GFF3 File:**\n  - Scroll down to the section where GFF3 files are listed.\n  - Identify the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n\n- **Extract the Link:**\n  - Copy the direct URL or download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n- **Verify the Link:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to click the link and ensure it leads to a valid GFF3 file.\n\n- **Provide the Final Answer:**\n  - Use Assistant to provide the final link to the GFF3 file in a clear and concise manner.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Correct Page**\n  - WebSurfer: Navigate to https://mart.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index.\n  - WebSurfer: Click on the 'Downloads' section.\n\n- **Step 2: Verify the Correct Page**\n  - WebSurfer: Check the URL to ensure it is the correct downloads page for the beluga whale genome.\n  - WebSurfer: Verify the page content to ensure it lists GFF3 files for the beluga whale.\n\n- **Step 3: Locate the GFF3 File**\n  - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the section where GFF3 files are listed.\n  - WebSurfer: Identify the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n\n- **Step 4: Extract the Link**\n  - WebSurfer: Copy the direct URL or download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n- **Step 5: Verify the Link**\n  - WebSurfer: Click the link to ensure it leads to a valid GFF3 file.\n\n- **Step 6: Provide the Final Answer**\n  - Assistant: Provide the final link to the GFF3 file in a clear and concise manner.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and adjustments:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is for a GFF3 file related to beluga whales.\n   - The file must have been the most recent as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The Ensembl database contains a genome assembly for the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) with the assembly name ASM228892v3 (GCA_002288925.3).\n   - The Ensembl page for the beluga whale genome is accessible at https://mart.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific location within the Ensembl database where the GFF3 file for the beluga whale is stored.\n   - The most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales available as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The exact URL or link to the GFF3 file.\n   - The release notes or changelog for the Ensembl database around the time of 20/10/2020 to identify the relevant release.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determine the Ensembl release closest to 20/10/2020 to find the most recent GFF3 file for that date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file is likely to be found in the 'Downloads' section of the Ensembl page for the beluga whale genome.\n   - The file might be part of a larger dataset or project focused on marine mammals or beluga whales specifically.\n   - Given that the current Ensembl release is 114 (May 2025), the GFF3 file for the beluga whale as of 20/10/2020 might be available in an archived version of the Ensembl database or a previous release.\n   - The most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020 is likely to be in Ensembl release 100 or 101, which were active around that time.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The Ensembl database is a primary source for genomic data, and the presence of the beluga whale genome assembly (ASM228892v3) suggests that the GFF3 file is likely available there.\n- Since the current Ensembl release is much later than 20/10/2020, it is reasonable to assume that the most recent GFF3 file as of that date might be in an older release or an archived version of the database.\n- Ensembl releases are typically numbered sequentially, and the release around 20/10/2020 would likely be in the range of 100-101.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate back to the beluga whale genome page (https://mart.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index).\n   - Click on the 'Downloads' section to ensure it leads to the specific downloads for the beluga whale genome.\n\n2. **Verify the Correct Page:**\n   - Check the URL to ensure it is the correct downloads page for the beluga whale genome.\n   - Verify the page content to ensure it lists GFF3 files for the beluga whale.\n\n3. **Locate the GFF3 File:**\n   - Scroll down to the section where GFF3 files are listed.\n   - Identify the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n\n4. **Extract the Link:**\n   - Copy the direct URL or download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n5. **Verify the Link:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to click the link and ensure it leads to a valid GFF3 file.\n\n6. **Check Archived Releases:**\n   - If the GFF3 file is not found in the current release, navigate to the Ensembl archive site (https://archive.ensembl.org/) and look for the relevant release (100 or 101).\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer:**\n   - Use Assistant to provide the final link to the GFF3 file in a clear and concise manner.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Correct Page**\n  - WebSurfer: Navigate to https://mart.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index.\n  - WebSurfer: Click on the 'Downloads' section.\n\n- **Step 2: Verify the Correct Page**\n  - WebSurfer: Check the URL to ensure it is the correct downloads page for the beluga whale genome.\n  - WebSurfer: Verify the page content to ensure it lists GFF3 files for the beluga whale.\n\n- **Step 3: Locate the GFF3 File**\n  - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the section where GFF3 files are listed.\n  - WebSurfer: Identify the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n\n- **Step 4: Extract the Link**\n  - WebSurfer: Copy the direct URL or download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n- **Step 5: Verify the Link**\n  - WebSurfer: Click the link to ensure it leads to a valid GFF3 file.\n\n- **Step 6: Check Archived Releases**\n  - WebSurfer: If the file is not found, navigate to https://archive.ensembl.org/ and look for release 100 or 101.\n\n- **Step 7: Provide the Final Answer**\n  - Assistant: Provide the final link to the GFF3 file in a clear and concise manner.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Incorrect Navigation:** The WebSurfer navigated to the wrong page when clicking the 'Downloads' link, leading to a general data access page instead of the specific downloads page for the beluga whale genome.\n- **Lack of Verification:** There was no step to verify that the correct page was reached after clicking the 'Downloads' link, which led to confusion and incorrect navigation.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Correct Page**\n  - WebSurfer: Navigate to https://mart.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index.\n  - WebSurfer: Click on the 'Downloads' section to ensure it leads to the specific downloads page for the beluga whale genome.\n\n- **Step 2: Verify the Correct Page**\n  -

Check the URL to ensure it is the correct downloads page for the beluga whale genome.\n   - Verify the page content to ensure it lists GFF3 files for the beluga whale.\n\n3. **Locate the GFF3 File:**\n   - Scroll down to the section where GFF3 files are listed.\n   - Identify the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n\n4. **Extract the Link:**\n   - Copy the direct URL or download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n5. **Verify the Link:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to click the link and ensure it leads to a valid GFF3 file.\n\n6. **Check Archived Releases:**\n   - If the GFF3 file is not found in the current release, navigate to the Ensembl archive site (https://archive.ensembl.org/) and look for the relevant release (100 or 101).\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer:**\n   - Use Assistant to provide the final link to the GFF3 file in a clear and concise manner.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Correct Page**\n  - WebSurfer: Navigate to https://mart.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index.\n  - WebSurfer: Click on the 'Downloads' section.\n\n- **Step 2: Verify the Correct Page**\n  - WebSurfer: Check the URL to ensure it is the correct downloads page for the beluga whale genome.\n  - WebSurfer: Verify the page content to ensure it lists GFF3 files for the beluga whale.\n\n- **Step 3: Locate the GFF3 File**\n  -

WebSurfer: Click the link to ensure it leads to a valid GFF3 file.\n\n- **Step 6: Check Archived Releases**\n  - WebSurfer: If the GFF3 file is not found, navigate to https://archive.ensembl.org/ and look for release 100 or 101.\n\n- **Step 7: Provide the Final Answer**\n  - Assistant: Provide the final link to the GFF3 file in a clear and concise manner.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Incorrect Navigation:** The WebSurfer navigated to a general data access page instead of the specific downloads page for the beluga whale genome when clicking the 'Downloads' section.\n- **Lack of Verification:** There was no step to verify that the correct page was reached after clicking the 'Downloads' link, leading to confusion and incorrect navigation.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Correct Page**\n  - WebSurfer: Navigate to https://mart.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index.\n  - WebSurfer: Click on the 'Downloads' section.\n\n- **Step 2: Verify the Correct Page**\n  - WebSurfer: Check the URL to ensure it is the correct downloads page for the beluga whale genome.\n  -

We maintain the Ensembl Archive sites so that there are stable links to data from a particular release. As of December 2016 these will be available for \nfive years, together with the following longer term archives: \nAnnotation on the \nhuman NCBI36 assembly is available at our \nEnsembl 54 archive site.\nAnnotation on the \nmouse NCBIm37 assembly is available at our \nEnsembl 67 archive site.\nAs from August 2014 we are supporting the \nhuman GRCh37 assembly at our dedicated \nGRCh37 human site. Unlike the other Ensembl archive sites, this will be updated to the latest web interface every Ensembl release and there may be occasional data updates to human.\n Archived databases are also maintained for at least 10 years. More information is available from our \nMySQL database documentation. We also maintain data archives from 2004 available from our \nFTP site. \nFor all enquiries, please \ncontact the Ensembl HelpDesk.\nNotes\nEnsembl aims to maintain stable identifiers for genes (ENSG), transcripts (ENST), proteins (ENSP) and exons (ENSE) as long as possible. Changes within the genome sequence assembly or an updated genome annotation may dramatically change a gene model. In these cases, the old set of stable IDs is retired and a new one assigned. Gene and transcript pages both have an ID History view which maps changes in the ID from the earliest version in Ensembl.\nProtein family identifiers (fam), Ensembl EST gene identifiers (ENSESTG) and Genscan identifiers (GENSCAN) are currently not stable.\nWith the exception of the GRCh37 human site \nBLAST, BLAT and other tools are not available from the archive sites.\nAccounts are shared between the current site and almost all archives. The exceptions are the older human NCBI36 and the mouse GRCm37 sites where changes in architecture and code make sharing logins impractical. \nLinking to the Archive Ensembl sites\nThe Archive Ensembl sites have the format: \nhttp://<three-letter-month><year>.archive.ensembl.org for example \nhttp://nov2008.archive.ensembl.org)\nIn the footer of each current Ensembl page, there is a link called 'Permanent link', which links to the corresponding page in the Ensembl Archive. A similar link on each archive page links back to the current site (i.e. www.ensembl.org).\nFor example if you are looking at the Alternative Splicing view for human gene BRCA2 on the \nmain Ensembl site in August 2015, when Ensembl 80 was the current version, the URL would be:\nhttp://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Splice?db=core;g=ENSG00000139618;r=13:31787617-31871809;t=ENST00000380152and the equivalent archived page URL would be:\nhttp://jul2015.archive.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Splice?db=core;g=ENSG00000139618;r=13:31787617-31871809;t=ENST00000380152This website requires cookies, and the limited processing of your personal data in order to function.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the link to the GFF3 file for beluga whales that was the most recent one on 20/10/2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is for a GFF3 file related to beluga whales.\n   - The file must have been the most recent as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The Ensembl database contains a genome assembly for the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) with the assembly name ASM228892v3 (GCA_002288925.3).\n   - The Ensembl page for the beluga whale genome is accessible at https://mart.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index.\n   - The 'Downloads' section on the beluga whale genome page leads to a general data access page rather than the specific downloads page for the beluga whale genome.\n   - The Ensembl archive site (https://archive.ensembl.org/) provides access to older releases, including release 101 (August 2020).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific location within the Ensembl database where the GFF3 file for the beluga whale is stored.\n   - The most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales available as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The exact URL or link to the GFF3 file.\n   - The release notes or changelog for the Ensembl database around the time of 20/10/2020 to identify the relevant release.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determine the Ensembl release closest to 20/10/2020 to find the most recent GFF3 file for that date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file is likely to be found in the 'Downloads' section of the Ensembl page for the beluga whale genome, but the correct subsection needs to be identified.\n   - The file might be part of a larger dataset or project focused on marine mammals or beluga whales specifically.\n   - Given that the current Ensembl release is 114 (May 2025), the GFF3 file for the beluga whale as of 20/10/2020 might be available in an archived version of the Ensembl database or a previous release.\n   - The most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020 is likely to be in Ensembl release 100 or 101, which were active around that time.\n   - The specific GFF3 file might be listed under the \"FTP site\" or \"BioMart\" sections, as these are common methods for accessing large datasets in Ensembl.\n   - The GFF3 file for the beluga whale might be available in the FTP directory for the specific release (e.g., `ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-101/gff3/delphinapterus_leucas/`).\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The Ensembl database is a primary source for genomic data, and the presence of the beluga whale genome assembly (ASM228892v3) suggests that the GFF3 file is likely available there.\n- Since the current Ensembl release is much later than 20/10/2020, it is reasonable to assume that the most recent GFF3 file as of that date might be in an older release or an archived version of the database.\n- Ensembl releases are typically numbered sequentially, and the release around 20/10/2020 would likely be in the range of 100-101.\n- The FTP site and BioMart are common methods for accessing large datasets in Ensembl, so the GFF3 file might be listed there.\n- The FTP directory structure often follows a consistent pattern, and the GFF3 file for the beluga whale might be located in a specific subdirectory for that release.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the beluga whale genome page in the Ensembl archive site for release 101 (https://aug2020.archive.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index).\n   - Click on the 'Downloads' section to ensure it leads to the specific downloads for the beluga whale genome.\n\n2. **Verify the Correct Page:**\n   - Check the URL to ensure it is the correct downloads page for the beluga whale genome.\n   - Verify the page content to ensure it lists GFF3 files for the beluga whale.\n\n3. **Locate the GFF3 File:**\n   - Scroll down to the section where GFF3 files are listed.\n   - Identify the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n\n4. **Extract the Link:**\n   - Copy the direct URL or download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n5. **Verify the Link:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to click the link and ensure it leads to a valid GFF3 file.\n\n6. **Check FTP Directory:**\n   - If the GFF3 file is not found on the web page, navigate to the FTP directory for release 101 (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-101/gff3/delphinapterus_leucas/) and look for the GFF3 file.\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer:**\n   - Use Assistant to provide the final link to the GFF3 file in a clear and concise manner.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Correct Page**\n  - WebSurfer: Navigate to https://aug2020.archive.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index.\n  - WebSurfer: Click on the 'Downloads' section.\n\n- **Step 2: Verify the Correct Page**\n  - WebSurfer: Check the URL to ensure it is the correct downloads page for the beluga whale genome.\n  - WebSurfer: Verify the page content to ensure it lists GFF3 files for the beluga whale.\n\n- **Step 3: Locate the GFF3 File**\n  - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the section where GFF3 files are listed.\n  - WebSurfer: Identify the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n\n- **Step 4: Extract the Link**\n  - WebSurfer: Copy the direct URL or download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n- **Step 5: Verify the Link**\n  - WebSurfer: Click the link to ensure it leads to a valid GFF3 file.\n\n- **Step 6: Check FTP Directory**\n  - WebSurfer: If the GFF3 file is not found, navigate to ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-101/gff3/delphinapterus_leucas/ and look for the GFF3 file.\n\n- **Step 7: Provide the Final Answer**\n  - Assistant: Provide the final link to the GFF3 file in a clear and concise manner.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Incorrect Navigation:** The WebSurfer navigated to the general data access page instead of the specific downloads page for the beluga whale genome when clicking the 'Downloads' section.\n- **Lack of Verification:** There was no step to verify that the correct page was reached after clicking the 'Downloads' link, leading to confusion and incorrect navigation.\n- **Repetitive Actions:** The same steps were repeated without addressing the underlying issue of incorrect navigation and verification.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page:**\n   - WebSurfer: Navigate to https://aug2020.archive.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index.\n   - WebSurfer: Click on the 'Downloads' section.\n\n2. **Verify the Correct Page:**\n   - WebSurfer: Check the URL to ensure it is the correct downloads page for the beluga whale genome.\n   - WebSurfer: Verify the page content to ensure it lists GFF3 files for the beluga whale.\n\n3. **Locate the GFF3 File:**\n   - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the section where GFF3 files are listed.\n   - WebSurfer: Identify the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n\n4. **Extract the Link:**\n   - WebSurfer: Copy the direct URL or download link for the GFF3 file.\n\n5. **Verify the Link:**\n   - WebSurfer: Click the link to ensure it leads to a valid GFF3 file.\n\n6. **Check FTP Directory:**\n   - If the GFF3 file is not found on the web page, use the ComputerTerminal to navigate to the FTP directory for release 101 and look for the GFF3 file.\n     ```sh\n     wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -A gff3 ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-101/gff3/delphinapterus_leucas/\n     ```\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer:**\n   - Assistant: Provide the final link to the GFF3 file in a clear and concise manner.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n- **Verification:** Always verify the URL and page content after navigating to a new page to ensure it is the correct page.\n- **Specificity:** Ensure that the 'Downloads' section leads to the specific downloads page for the beluga whale genome, not a general data access page.\n- **Attention to Detail:** Pay close attention to the structure of the page and the sections where GFF3 files are listed.\n- **FTP Fallback:** If the GFF3 file is not found on the web page, use the FTP directory as a fallback method to locate the file.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

Various REST endpoints provide access to vast amounts of Ensembl data.\nComplete datasets and databases\nMany datasets, e.g. all genes for a species, are available to download in a variety of formats from our \nFTP site.\nEntire databases are also available via FTP as MySQL dumps.\nComplex cross-database queries\nMore complex datasets can be retrieved using the \nBioMart data-mining tool.\nAll data produced by the Ensembl project is \nfreely available for your own use.\nEnsembl release 101 - August 2020 © \nEMBL-EBI.\nAbout Us\nAbout usContact usCiting EnsemblGet help\nUsing this websiteAdding custom tracksDownloading dataOur sister sites\nEnsembl BacteriaEnsembl FungiEnsembl PlantsFollow us\nBlog \nTwitter \nFacebookThis website requires cookies, and the limited processing of your personal data in order to function.
