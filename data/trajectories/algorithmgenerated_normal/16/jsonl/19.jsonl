The voice actor is Andy Serkis. \n\nFirst, I'll write a Python script to search for videos that match these criteria and retrieve their details, focusing on the date and relevant keywords. \n\nLet's execute the following code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Set the API key and endpoint\nAPI_KEY = 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_DATA_API_KEY'\nSEARCH_ENDPOINT = 'https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search'\n\n# Define the parameters for the search\nparams = {\n    'part': 'snippet',\n    'q': '360 VR Andy Serkis dinosaur',\n    'type': 'video',\n    'publishedAfter': '2018-03-01T00:00:00Z',\n    'publishedBefore': '2018-03-31T23:59:59Z',\n    'key': API_KEY\n}\n\n# Perform the search request\nresponse = requests.get(SEARCH_ENDPOINT, params=params)\nvideo_data = response.json()\n\n# Check for videos\nif 'items' in video_data:\n    for item in video_data['items']:\n        print(f\"Title: {item['snippet']['title']}, Video ID: {item['id']['videoId']}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No videos found.\")\n```\n\nI will provide this script to the Computer_terminal for execution to find the relevant video ID.

This might indicate that the video may not be indexed under those search terms, or it may not have been released in that time frame as initially thought.\n\nTo move forward, we can take a few alternative approaches:\n\n1. **Manual Search**: We can manually search for the 360 VR video narrated by Andy Serkis from March 2018 using YouTube to verify if the video exists.\n2. **Broaden the Date Range**: We could expand the date range slightly to see if the video falls outside our initial limits while remaining within a reasonable frame.\n3. **Check for Other Narrations**: If it is not specifically 360 VR, we could check for videos narrated by Andy Serkis about dinosaurs more generally.\n\nIf you have a preference for any of these alternatives or any other approach, please let me know how you would like to proceed."}
