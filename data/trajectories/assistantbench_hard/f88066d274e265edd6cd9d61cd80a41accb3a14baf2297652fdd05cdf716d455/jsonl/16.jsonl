Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The trails must be in Yosemite National Park.\n   - The trails must lead to waterfalls.\n   - The trails must have more than 1,000 reviews on TripAdvisor.\n   - The trails must be recommended as fully accessible to wheelchairs by at least three different people.\n   - The trails must have an average rating of 4.5/5 or higher on TripAdvisor.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific names of popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park.\n   - Number of reviews for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n   - Average ratings for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n   - Recommendations regarding wheelchair accessibility for each trail, specifically from at least three different sources.\n   - Sources for this information could include:\n     - Official Yosemite National Park website.\n     - TripAdvisor reviews and ratings.\n     - Accessibility guides or reports from the National Park Service.\n     - Travel blogs and forums focused on accessible travel.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which trails meet all the criteria (more than 1,000 reviews, 4.5/5 or higher rating, and at least three recommendations for wheelchair accessibility).\n   - Cross-referencing multiple sources to ensure the accuracy of the wheelchair accessibility claims.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, popular trails in Yosemite that often come up in discussions about waterfalls and accessibility might include the Lower Yosemite Falls Trail and the Bridalveil Fall Trail. However, these would need to be verified against the specific criteria given in the request.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify Popular Hiking Trails to Waterfalls in Yosemite National Park**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park.\n  - Focus on reputable sources such as the official Yosemite National Park website, TripAdvisor, and travel blogs.\n\n- **Step 2: Filter Trails by Review Count and Rating**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the TripAdvisor pages for the identified trails.\n  - Extract the number of reviews and average ratings for each trail.\n  - Filter out trails that do not have more than 1,000 reviews and an average rating of 4.5/5 or higher.\n\n- **Step 3: Check Wheelchair Accessibility Recommendations**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for accessibility information for the remaining trails.\n  - Look for at least three different sources recommending each trail as fully accessible to wheelchairs.\n  - Sources could include official park accessibility guides, travel blogs, and user reviews on platforms like TripAdvisor.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile and Verify the Final List**\n  - Use Assistant to compile the final list of trails that meet all the criteria.\n  - Double-check the information for accuracy and consistency.\n\n- **Step 5: Present the Findings**\n  - Use Assistant to format and present the final list of trails, including their names, review counts, average ratings, and sources of wheelchair accessibility recommendations."}

Storms in late fall rejuvenate some of the waterfalls and all of them accumulate frost along their edges many nights during the winter.\nAs you approach a waterfall during high flow, you'll have a powerful experience complete with misty wind and booming water. But, the waterfalls at low flow have their own beauty and serenity. Be sure to stay on trails—the rock is extremely slick (even when dry) and the ciurrent in the river or creek is very powerful.\nYosemite is home to so many waterfalls primarily as a result of \nglaciers. \nRivers cut deep canyons, which glaciers later widened, steepened, and further deepened. Without glaciers, these same creeks and rivers would still exist, but would form shorter cascades as they tumbled down slopes (instead of cliffs).\nBelow is an incomplete list of some of Yosemite's more famous waterfalls. While all but the last two of the waterfalls listed are in Yosemite Valley, Yosemite Valley and many other areas of the park have waterfalls both big and small.\nYosemite Falls\n2,245 feet / 740 m\nFlows: approximately November through July, with peak flow in May.\nLook for the ice cone at the base of the upper fall during winter and for roaring runoff April through June. Yosemite Falls, one of the world's tallest, is actually made up of three separate falls: Upper Yosemite Fall (1,430 feet), the middle cascades (675 feet), and Lower Yosemite Fall (320 feet).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n---\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The trails must be in Yosemite National Park.\n   - The trails must lead to waterfalls.\n   - The trails must have more than 1,000 reviews on TripAdvisor.\n   - The trails must be recommended as fully accessible to wheelchairs by at least three different people.\n   - The trails must have an average rating of 4.5/5 or higher on TripAdvisor.\n   - The Lower Yosemite Fall Trail is a popular attraction and is described as easily accessible by people of all ages, with a good walking road leading to the fall. The eastern side of the loop trail from the shuttle stop to the base of the waterfall is wheelchair accessible.\n\n#### 2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific names of popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park.\n     - **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: Confirmed as popular and partially wheelchair accessible.\n     - **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: Needs verification.\n     - **Mist Trail to Vernal Fall**: Needs verification.\n   - Number of reviews for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n     - **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: Needs verification.\n     - **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: Needs verification.\n     - **Mist Trail to Vernal Fall**: Needs verification.\n   - Average ratings for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n     - **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: Needs verification.\n     - **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: Needs verification.\n     - **Mist Trail to Vernal Fall**: Needs verification.\n   - Recommendations regarding wheelchair accessibility for each trail, specifically from at least three different sources.\n     - **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: Partially confirmed; needs more sources.\n     - **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: Needs verification.\n     - **Mist Trail to Vernal Fall**: Needs verification.\n   - Sources for this information could include:\n     - Official Yosemite National Park website.\n     - TripAdvisor reviews and ratings.\n     - Accessibility guides or reports from the National Park Service.\n     - Travel blogs and forums focused on accessible travel.\n\n#### 3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which trails meet all the criteria (more than 1,000 reviews, 4.5/5 or higher rating, and at least three recommendations for wheelchair accessibility).\n   - Cross-referencing multiple sources to ensure the accuracy of the wheelchair accessibility claims.\n\n#### 4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**: Based on the information from the official Yosemite National Park website and initial searches, this trail is likely to meet the criteria. It is popular, has a portion that is wheelchair accessible, and is described as easily accessible by people of all ages. However, we need to verify the number of reviews, average rating, and additional sources for wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: This trail is often mentioned as being short and relatively easy, which suggests it might be accessible. However, it needs to be verified for the number of reviews, average rating, and wheelchair accessibility recommendations.\n   - **Mist Trail to Vernal Fall**: This trail is known for its scenic beauty and popularity, but it is also known to be more challenging. It needs to be verified for the number of reviews, average rating, and wheelchair accessibility recommendations.\n   - **Additional Trails**: There may be other trails in Yosemite National Park that are popular and accessible, such as the Valley Loop Trail or the Cook's Meadow Loop. These trails should also be considered and verified for the given criteria.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Verify the Lower Yosemite Fall Trail**:\n   - Check the number of reviews and average rating on TripAdvisor.\n   - Find at least three different sources recommending it as fully accessible to wheelchairs.\n\n2. **Verify the Bridalveil Fall Trail**:\n   - Check the number of reviews and average rating on TripAdvisor.\n   - Find at least three different sources recommending it as fully accessible to wheelchairs.\n\n3. **Verify the Mist Trail to Vernal Fall**:\n   - Check the number of reviews and average rating on TripAdvisor.\n   - Find at least three different sources recommending it as fully accessible to wheelchairs.\n\n4. **Explore Additional Trails**:\n   - Investigate other popular trails in Yosemite National Park, such as the Valley Loop Trail and Cook's Meadow Loop, for their accessibility and ratings.\n\n5. **Cross-reference all findings** to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n- **Ensure Full Page Load**: Before extracting information, use the `sleep` function to ensure the page is fully loaded.\n- **Scroll to Relevant Sections**: Use the `scroll` function to navigate to the review and rating sections of the page.\n- **Extract Specific Information**: Use specific keywords to extract the number of reviews, average ratings, and wheelchair accessibility recommendations.\n- **Cross-Reference Multiple Sources**: Ensure that the information is consistent across multiple sources to avoid errors.\n\n---\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to gather the required information for the Lower Yosemite Fall Trail, Bridalveil Fall Trail, and Mist Trail to Vernal Fall. We will also explore additional trails as needed.\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Lower Yosemite Fall Trail\nNavigate to the TripAdvisor page for the Lower Yosemite Fall Trail: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g61000-d12361670-Reviews-Lower_Yosemite_Fall_Trail-Yosemite_National_Park_California.html.

Peak runoff typically happens in May or June, with some waterfalls (including Yosemite Falls) often only a trickle or completely dry by August. Storms in late fall rejuvenate some of the waterfalls and all of them accumulate frost along their edges many nights during the winter.\nAs you approach a waterfall during high flow, you'll have a powerful experience complete with misty wind and booming water. But, the waterfalls at low flow have their own beauty and serenity. Be sure to stay on trails—the rock is extremely slick (even when dry) and the ciurrent in the river or creek is very powerful.\nYosemite is home to so many waterfalls primarily as a result of \nglaciers. \nRivers cut deep canyons, which glaciers later widened, steepened, and further deepened. Without glaciers, these same creeks and rivers would still exist, but would form shorter cascades as they tumbled down slopes (instead of cliffs).\nBelow is an incomplete list of some of Yosemite's more famous waterfalls. While all but the last two of the waterfalls listed are in Yosemite Valley, Yosemite Valley and many other areas of the park have waterfalls both big and small.\nYosemite Falls\n2,245 feet / 740 m\nFlows: approximately November through July, with peak flow in May.\nLook for the ice cone at the base of the upper fall during winter and for roaring runoff April through June. Yosemite Falls, one of the world's tallest, is actually made up of three separate falls: Upper Yosemite Fall (1,430 feet), the middle cascades (675 feet), and Lower Yosemite Fall (320 feet).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

It is comprised of multiple cascades, which range in height from 50 to 500 feet.\nYou can see this waterfall from areas along Southside Drive near the Sentinel Beach Picnic Area, and near the Four Mile Trailhead. Alternatively, you can view it from across Yosemite Valley near Leidig Meadow, or while hiking the Yosemite Falls Trail.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
