Let's proceed with that. \n\n### Step 1: Identify Featured Articles Promoted in November 2016\n\nI will search for Featured Articles that were promoted in that timeframe and filter for dinosaur-related articles. \n\nI'll write a query to fetch that information from the relevant Wikipedia API. \n\nLet's execute the necessary code to retrieve the list of Featured Articles promoted in November 2016. \n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Fetch Featured Articles promoted in November 2016\ndef fetch_featured_articles_november_2016():\n    url = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php\"\n    params = {\n        \"action\": \"query\",\n        \"list\": \"featuredarticles\",\n        \"faprop\": \"timestamp|user|comment|title\",\n        \"fauser\": \"true\",\n        \"format\": \"json\",\n        \"continue\": \"\",\n        \"fauntil\": \"2016-11-30T23:59:59Z\",\n        \"fafrom\": \"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z\"\n    }\n    \n    response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n    data = response.json()\n    \n    return data\n\nfeatured_articles_november_2016 = fetch_featured_articles_november_2016()\nprint(featured_articles_november_2016)\n```\n\nNow, I will execute the above code to see the featured articles promoted in November 2016."}
