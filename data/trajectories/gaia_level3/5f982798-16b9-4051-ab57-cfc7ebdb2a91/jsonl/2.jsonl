There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - There was a diagram of an X-ray time profile in the paper.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors published in July 2020.\n   - The user is looking for the difference in seconds in the measured time span between the two diagrams.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact measured time span in seconds for the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact measured time span in seconds for the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - Both papers can be found on Arxiv, and the specific diagrams should be located within these papers.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the measured time spans of the two diagrams once the specific values are obtained.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The time spans are likely to be in the range of milliseconds to seconds, given the nature of fast radio bursts.\n   - The difference in time spans might be small, as both diagrams are related to fast radio bursts and are from the same author. However, this is speculative without the actual data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Papers**: Use WebSurfer to search for the papers on Arxiv using the provided dates (March 2021 and July 2020) and keywords (multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts).\n- **Locate the Diagrams**: Once the papers are found, use WebSurfer to locate the specific diagrams mentioned (X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper and burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper).\n- **Extract Time Span Data**: Use WebSurfer to extract the measured time spans in seconds from the diagrams in both papers.\n- **Calculate the Difference**: Use Assistant to calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n- **Provide the Answer**: Provide the calculated difference in seconds to the user."}

Introduction\n\nThe multiwavelength (MWL) approach to study transient astronomical events has demonstrated its\neffectiveness in solving many puzzles in astronomy, both related to “local” and extragalactic sources. The\nGamma Ray Burst (GRB) phenomenon represents a perfect example. Wide area detectors (e.g., high-energy\nmonitors) or speciﬁc surveys monitoring large areas of the sky can detect events that only last for a short\nperiod of time. Being able to reduce positional uncertainties and perform timely MWL observations\nusing sensitive and high-enough resolution instruments could be the only way to discriminate among\nthe possible progenitors. This is a key point when the transient astronomical event is only detected in a\n\nUniverse 2021, 7, 76; doi:10.3390/universe7030076\n\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/universe\n\n\fUniverse 2021, 7, 76\n\n2 of 48\n\nsingle band of the electromagnetic spectrum or when multiple sources could produce that event. Studying\nthe source emission in a as wide as possible spectral band justiﬁes huge efforts in terms of observational\ntime and manpower. It, typically, turns out to be the only way to solve the most challenging questions in\nastrophysics.\n\nFast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are among the most studied astrophysical transients, still their origin and\nwhether there are multiple types of progenitors and emission mechanisms are still open questions (see [1–5]\nfor a review). Are (apparently) one-off and repeating events representative of distinct samples or are they\nthe realization of a very wide timescales distribution of the same objects class? Can the periodicity seen in\na few FRBs be reconciled with the proposed models? Is the behavior distinctive of a class or sub-class of\nFRBs? Of the about 140 distinct sources known [https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/] (accessed on 1 March 2021)\n(but we are aware that many more have been discovered but remain unpublished at the time of writing this\nreview), only for a bunch of them a MWL search campaign was possible, in particular for the two repeating\n(and periodic) sources FRB 20121102A (commonly referred as FRB 121102) and FRB 20180916B (also referred\nas FRB 180916 and FRB 180916.J0158+65, see below for the details).

Wide area detectors (e.g., high-energy\nmonitors) or speciﬁc surveys monitoring large areas of the sky can detect events that only last for a short\nperiod of time. Being able to reduce positional uncertainties and perform timely MWL observations\nusing sensitive and high-enough resolution instruments could be the only way to discriminate among\nthe possible progenitors. This is a key point when the transient astronomical event is only detected in a\n\nUniverse 2021, 7, 76; doi:10.3390/universe7030076\n\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/universe\n\n\fUniverse 2021, 7, 76\n\n2 of 48\n\nsingle band of the electromagnetic spectrum or when multiple sources could produce that event.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Let's update the fact sheet based on the progress and insights we've gained so far.\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - There was a diagram of an X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors published in July 2020.\n   - The user is looking for the difference in seconds in the measured time span between the two diagrams.\n   - The March 2021 paper is titled \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\" and is available on Arxiv with the identifier `arXiv:2103.07786`.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact measured time span in seconds for the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact measured time span in seconds for the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - The title and identifier of the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the measured time spans of the two diagrams once the specific values are obtained.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The time spans are likely to be in the range of milliseconds to seconds, given the nature of fast radio bursts.\n   - The difference in time spans might be small, as both diagrams are related to fast radio bursts and are from the same author. However, this is speculative without the actual data.\n   - The X-ray time profile diagram in the March 2021 paper is likely to be found in the results or discussion sections, as these sections often contain detailed observational data.\n   - The July 2020 paper is likely to be titled similarly to the March 2021 paper, possibly with a focus on a specific aspect of fast radio bursts, such as \"Multiwavelength Observations of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts\" or \"High-Energy Counterparts to Fast Radio Bursts.\"\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses\n- **Location of the X-ray Time Profile Diagram**: Scientific papers often place detailed observational data in the results or discussion sections. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect the X-ray time profile diagram to be in one of these sections.\n- **Title and Focus of the July 2020 Paper**: Given that the author(s) of the March 2021 paper have also published on similar topics, it is likely that the July 2020 paper will have a related title and focus. This can help narrow down the search on Arxiv.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Locate the X-ray Time Profile Diagram in the March 2021 Paper**: Open the PDF `/workspace/2103.07786v2.pdf` and navigate to the results or discussion sections to find the X-ray time profile diagram and note the measured time span in seconds.\n2. **Find the July 2020 Paper**: Use the author names and keywords to search for the July 2020 paper on Arxiv. Once found, locate the burst-1 diagram and note the measured time span in seconds.\n3. **Calculate the Difference**: Once both time spans are obtained, calculate the difference in seconds and provide the answer to the user.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to find the required information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\nThe primary issue encountered was the inability to open and navigate the local PDF file `/workspace/2103.07786v2.pdf` using the web surfer. The web surfer is designed to interact with web pages and URLs, not local file paths, which led to the `net::ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED` error.\n\n### New Plan\n\nTo overcome this issue, we will use the `FileSurfer` to handle the local PDF file and extract the necessary information.

For example while a short GRB detected in the γ-rays can also last a few tens of\nmilliseconds [6,7], it can remain detectable at other wavelengths for days or longer. In the FRB case, even though\nsome of the many, still viable, emission mechanisms predict a sort of afterglow emission similar to that of GRBs,\nthey also predict a very weak signal on time scales of (at most) minutes after the radio burst. Therefore it seems\nmuch more promising searching for an almost simultaneous, ms-duration burst also at wavelengths outside the\nradio band. The recently proposed unified magnetar models by Lu et al. (2020) [8] and Margalit et al. (2020a) [9]\nsupport this scenario. This would then require MWL simultaneous observational campaigns and the use of\ndetectors capable of acquiring data at a high cadence. Fine time resolution is normal for high-energy detectors\non-board satellites, much less for on-ground optical/NIR cameras.\n\nIn spite of the lack of MWL detections, possibly due to the limited capabilities of existing instruments,\nthere is no doubt that also non-detections in FRB follow-up campaigns remain of great importance. Collecting\nobservational data and flux upper limits at all wavelengths are helpful to constrain rate and spectral properties,\nas well as to identify periods of active emission phases and then estimate the probability of events detection.\nThis is the case for repeating FRBs (rFRBs). Upper limits on fluxes are also relevant to constrain the fluence\nratios between the high energy bands (optical and X-/γ-ray) and the radio band, which in turn put constraints\non the proposed FRB emission models (e.g., [10], http://frbtheorycat.org (accessed on 1 March 2021)). At the\ncurrent stage of the FRB research, observational data that can rule out theories represent a highly valuable\nwork. Vacuum synchrotron maser, plasma synchrotron maser and synchrotron maser from magnetized\nshocks, coherent curvature emission, are among the most invoked mechanisms (see e.g., [4,5,11] for a review)\nbut, as it was the case for GRBs, the controversy on which radiation mechanism fits best the data may last\nawhile before reaching a final conclusion. With the additional complication of the (apparent/real) dicothomy\nof one-off and repeating bursts. Meanwhile, coordinated MWL observing campaigns, in particular of rFRBs,\nrepresent a key point to verify/challenge their predictions.\n\nAs new MWL observational data are being published on the transient emission from the Galactic\nmagnetars SGR J1935+2154 [12–18], 1E 1547.0–5408 [19], XTE J1810–197 [20], Swift J1818.0–1607 [21],\nsimilarities with the FRB phenomena become more and more striking, and then the possible common\nphysical processes involved [8]. On the other hand MWL campaigns on FRB 20180916B can rule out the\noccurrence of magnetar giant ﬂares (MGF) (E < 1045−47 erg) either simultaneous to a few radio bursts,\nor in general during some of the radio-burst active phases [22–26] and constrain the possible associated\npersistent X-ray luminosity to <2 × 1040 erg s−1 [22], which is still decades above the observed persistent\nluminosity of magnetars. In addition, the possible existence of a population of extragalactic magnetars\nthat are equally or even more active than their Galactic siblings and that can emit even more energetic\n\n\fUniverse 2021, 7, 76\n\n3 of 48\n\nﬂares [27,28], as was also the recent case of a MGF from NGC 253 (Sculptor Galaxy) at 3.5 Mpc [29–31],\nadds to the case of monitoring the high-energy activity of nearby rFRBs. In parallel, the expected growing\nsample of rFRBs in the coming years will enable a systematic search for past activity hidden in the optical\nand high-energy surveys, as was done for the few known cases (e.g., [32–36]).\n\nRegarding the FRBs host galaxies, as of today 13 have been ﬁrmly identiﬁed. Such limited sample\ndoes not yet allow us to draw solid conclusions about potential progenitors as observational selection\nbiases could play an important role. However statistical studies of stellar masses and star formation rates\n(SFRs) suggest that, at least some of them, are consistent with the host galaxies of core-collapse supernovae\n(CCSNe), but not with the hosts of long GRBs (LGRBs) and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) [37–39].\nThis strengthens the possibility that FRBs are produced by magnetars. As a larger sample of FRB hosts\nbecomes available, possibly with offset distribution and local environment studies, it may turn up evidence\nfor alternate magnetar formation channels or call for a second progenitor scenario for FRBs.\n\nFRB 20121102A [40] was the ﬁrst FRB for which multiple bursts were detected, and is then known as\nthe “repeating FRB” [41]. Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) sub-arcsec localisation allowed its host\ngalaxy at z (cid:39) 0.193 to be identiﬁed [42–44]. FRB 20180916B [45] was discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen\nIntensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and was immediately identiﬁed as a repeater.

In Section 4\nwe illustrate the various efforts and outcome from the observational campaigns and archival searches for\nthe high-energy counterpart of FRBs, from the optical band to the very high-energy (VHE) γ-rays.

The recent outcome from the MWL\nobservations performed during the April 2020 SGR J1935+2154 active phase are illustrated in Section 6. Our\nconclusions are summarized in Section 7.\n\n2. Magnetars\n\nSoft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) are thought to be magnetars, that\nis, young neutron stars (NSs) with extremely high magnetic ﬁelds [51–53] and are among the candidates\nfor the sources of FRBs. About thirty magnetars [http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~pulsar/magnetar/\n\n\fUniverse 2021, 7, 76\n\n4 of 48\n\nmain.html] (accessed on 1 March 2021) are currently known in our Galaxy (and the Magellanic Clouds),\nﬁve of which exhibited transient radio pulsations. The recent detection of γ-ray emission simultaneous\nto a fast radio burst (FRB 20200428A) originated in the Galactic SGR J1935+2154 has demonstrated the\ncommon origin of these phenomena. However the energetic for this event is of the order of 10−6 times\nthat of a cosmological FRB at z ∼ 1. We should point out that recently bursts just one decade more\nenergetic than FRB 20200428A were observed for FRB 20180916B [54], so it is not clear if it represents\njust the tail of a population, as volumetric-rate estimates might suggest [8]. Assuming this is the case,\nnot only must emission models be able to explain the extremely wide range of radio ﬂuxes, but also the\nradio-to-γ-ray ﬂuence ratio of FRB 20200428A ((cid:39) 2–4 × 10−6 in [12] and, more reliably, 3 × 10−5 in [13]),\nwhich is more than ﬁve orders of magnitude greater than that of SGR 1806−20 as no FRB was observed\nin the giant 27 December 2004 outburst of this SGR [55]. The Galactic FRB 20200428A is by far the most\nradio-luminous such event detected from any Galactic magnetar. The brightest radio burst previously\nseen from a magnetar was during the 2009 outburst of 1E 1547.0–408 and was three orders of magnitude\nfainter. Thus, FRB 20200428A clearly suggests that magnetars can produce far brighter radio bursts than\nhas been previously known.\n\nThe prominent role of magnetars as promising candidates for extragalactic FRB sources has fostered a\nnumber of complementary attempts to identify counterparts or associations with other classes of known\nsources: since magnetars are believed to represent the endpoint of some core-collapsed progenitors of\nlong GRBs (e.g., [56–58]), as well as the result of a compact binary merger signalled by a short GRB\n(e.g., [59–61]), some of these GRB sources were targeted by radio follow-up observations, either within\nhours of the GRB or years later, to search for FRB emission [62–67]. Systematic and sensitive searches for\nemission compatible with MGFs from well localised FRB sources have also been carried out in parallel,\nboth independently of and simultaneously with radio observations, whose results and implications are\npresented in Section 6.\n\n3.

The recent detection of γ-ray emission simultaneous\nto a fast radio burst (FRB 20200428A) originated in the Galactic SGR J1935+2154 has demonstrated the\ncommon origin of these phenomena. However the energetic for this event is of the order of 10−6 times\nthat of a cosmological FRB at z ∼ 1. We should point out that recently bursts just one decade more\nenergetic than FRB 20200428A were observed for FRB 20180916B [54], so it is not clear if it represents\njust the tail of a population, as volumetric-rate estimates might suggest [8]. Assuming this is the case,\nnot only must emission models be able to explain the extremely wide range of radio ﬂuxes, but also the\nradio-to-γ-ray ﬂuence ratio of FRB 20200428A ((cid:39) 2–4 × 10−6 in [12] and, more reliably, 3 × 10−5 in [13]),\nwhich is more than ﬁve orders of magnitude greater than that of SGR 1806−20 as no FRB was observed\nin the giant 27 December 2004 outburst of this SGR [55]. The Galactic FRB 20200428A is by far the most\nradio-luminous such event detected from any Galactic magnetar. The brightest radio burst previously\nseen from a magnetar was during the 2009 outburst of 1E 1547.0–408 and was three orders of magnitude\nfainter. Thus, FRB 20200428A clearly suggests that magnetars can produce far brighter radio bursts than\nhas been previously known.\n\nThe prominent role of magnetars as promising candidates for extragalactic FRB sources has fostered a\nnumber of complementary attempts to identify counterparts or associations with other classes of known\nsources: since magnetars are believed to represent the endpoint of some core-collapsed progenitors of\nlong GRBs (e.g., [56–58]), as well as the result of a compact binary merger signalled by a short GRB\n(e.g., [59–61]), some of these GRB sources were targeted by radio follow-up observations, either within\nhours of the GRB or years later, to search for FRB emission [62–67].

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - There was a diagram of an X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors published in July 2020.\n   - The user is looking for the difference in seconds in the measured time span between the two diagrams.\n   - The March 2021 paper is titled \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\" and is available on Arxiv with the identifier `arXiv:2103.07786`.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact measured time span in seconds for the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact measured time span in seconds for the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - The title and identifier of the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the measured time spans of the two diagrams once the specific values are obtained.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The time spans are likely to be in the range of milliseconds to seconds, given the nature of fast radio bursts.\n   - The difference in time spans might be small, as both diagrams are related to fast radio bursts and are from the same author. However, this is speculative without the actual data.\n   - The X-ray time profile diagram in the March 2021 paper is likely to be found in the results or discussion sections, as these sections often contain detailed observational data.\n   - The July 2020 paper is likely to be titled similarly to the March 2021 paper, possibly with a focus on a specific aspect of fast radio bursts, such as \"Multiwavelength Observations of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts\" or \"High-Energy Counterparts to Fast Radio Bursts.\"\n   - The X-ray time profile diagram in the March 2021 paper may be labeled or described with specific time units (e.g., milliseconds, seconds) in the caption or text near the diagram.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses\n- **Location of the X-ray Time Profile Diagram**: Scientific papers often place detailed observational data in the results or discussion sections. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect the X-ray time profile diagram to be in one of these sections.\n- **Title and Focus of the July 2020 Paper**: Given that the author(s) of the March 2021 paper have also published on similar topics, it is likely that the July 2020 paper will have a related title and focus. This can help narrow down the search on Arxiv.\n- **Time Units in the Diagram**: Papers typically provide clear labels and units for measurements in diagrams, especially in scientific contexts. Therefore, the time span in the X-ray time profile diagram is likely to be explicitly stated.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Locate the X-ray Time Profile Diagram in the March 2021 Paper**: Open the PDF `/workspace/2103.07786v2.pdf` and navigate to the results or discussion sections to find the X-ray time profile diagram and note the measured time span in seconds.\n2. **Find the July 2020 Paper**: Use the author names and keywords to search for the July 2020 paper on Arxiv. Once found, locate the burst-1 diagram and note the measured time span in seconds.\n3. **Calculate the Difference**: Once both time spans are obtained, calculate the difference in seconds and provide the answer to the user.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to find the required information.\n\n### Action\nNavigate to the results or discussion sections of the March 2021 paper to locate the X-ray time profile diagram and note the measured time span in seconds.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigation and Search Efficiency**: The previous attempts to navigate through the PDF and locate the X-ray time profile diagram were not efficient. The search terms used might not have been specific enough to quickly find the relevant section.\n- **Lack of Specific Search Terms**: The search terms used to find the X-ray time profile diagram were too broad, leading to inefficient navigation through the document.\n- **Manual Navigation**: Manual navigation through the PDF pages without specific guidance or search terms led to repeated viewing of the same sections without finding the desired diagram.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Specific Search Terms**:\n   - **Action**: Use `FileSurfer` to search for specific keywords related to the X-ray time profile diagram, such as \"X-ray time profile,\" \"X-ray light curve,\" \"X-ray burst,\" \"X-ray observation,\" or \"X-ray data.\"\n   - **Instruction**: Use the search function within the PDF to find these keywords and navigate directly to the relevant sections.\n\n2. **Locate the X-ray Time Profile Diagram**:\n   - **Action**: Once the keywords are found, carefully examine the surrounding text and figures to locate the X-ray time profile diagram.\n   - **Instruction**: Note the measured time span in seconds from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n\n3. **Find the July 2020 Paper**:\n   - **Action**: Use `WebSurfer` to search for the July 2020 paper on Arxiv using the author names and keywords.\n   - **Instruction**: Look for the paper titled \"Multiwavelength Observations of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts\" or similar. Once found, download the PDF and use the same search terms to locate the burst-1 diagram and note the measured time span in seconds.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - **Action**: Use `Assistant` to calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n   - **Instruction**: Subtract the time span of the burst-1 diagram from the time span of the X-ray time profile diagram.\n\n5. **Provide the Answer**:\n   - **Action**: Use `Assistant` to provide the calculated difference in seconds to the user.\n   - **Instruction**: Clearly state the difference in seconds.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Search for Specific Keywords in the March 2021 Paper**:\n   ```python\n   # Use FileSurfer to search for specific keywords in the PDF\n   file_surfer.search_in_pdf(\"/workspace/2103.07786v2.pdf\", [\"X-ray time profile\", \"X-ray light curve\", \"X-ray burst\", \"X-ray observation\", \"X-ray data\"])\n   ```\n\n2. **Locate the X-ray Time Profile Diagram**:\n   - **Action**: Once the keywords are found, navigate to the relevant sections and locate the X-ray time profile diagram.\n   - **Instruction**: Note the measured time span in seconds from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n\n3. **Find the July 2020 Paper**:\n   ```python\n   # Use WebSurfer to search for the July 2020 paper on Arxiv\n   web_surfer.search(\"Arxiv multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts July 2020 Luciano Nicastro\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Download and Search the July 2020 Paper**:\n   - **Action**: Once the paper is found, download the PDF and use the same search terms to locate the burst-1 diagram.\n   - **Instruction**: Note the measured time span in seconds from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   ```python\n   # Use Assistant to calculate the difference\n   def calculate_difference(time_span_march, time_span_july):\n       return time_span_march - time_span_july\n   ```\n\n6. **Provide the Answer**:\n   ```python\n   # Use Assistant to provide the answer\n   difference_in_seconds = calculate_difference(time_span_march, time_span_july)\n   print(f\"The difference in seconds is: {difference_in_seconds}\")\n   ```\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to efficiently locate the required diagrams, extract the time spans, and provide the user with the correct answer."}

This identiﬁcation, second ever for a rFRB, immediately showed a\ndichotomy with the case of the original repeater, with FRB 20180916B associated to a star-forming region\nwithin a nearby massive spiral galaxy whereas FRB 20121102A host is a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy.\nThe subsequent continuous monitoring of FRB 20180916B by CHIME led to the ﬁrst identiﬁcation of a\nperiodicity in the active phases of a rFRB [47], recurring every 16.3 days and with an active window phase\nof approx ±2.6 days around the midpoint of the window. Thanks to the continuing monitoring and bursts\ncollection, a periodicity of 161 ± 5 days in the FRB 20121102A bursts was later claimed by [48,49]. Models to\nexplain this recurring active phases are growing, with the most recent one invoking a potential connection\nto ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), the closest known persistent super-Eddington sources [50]. More\nabout these two peculiar FRBs in the Section 5.\n\nIn this paper we review the outcome of most FRB MWL searches reported in the literature, discuss\nthe capabilities of present and being built instrumentation and what we believe are the most promising\nstrategies to adopt in future campaigns. In Section 2 we introduce magnetars and the FRB 20200428A\ndetected from SGR J1935+2154. We discuss the characteristics of the currently identified FRB host galaxies\nin Section 3. A critical comparison of the various transient source hosts is also presented. In Section 4\nwe illustrate the various efforts and outcome from the observational campaigns and archival searches for\nthe high-energy counterpart of FRBs, from the optical band to the very high-energy (VHE) γ-rays. We\nfocus in particular on coordinated observational campaigns, being the most promising approach in light\nof the (quasi-)simultaneous MWL emission predicted by the magnetar-engine models. The most favoured\nemission models are also briefly discussed. FRBs γ-ray energetic is compared to the radio one and to that\nof GRBs and galactic magnetars. In Section 5 optical and higher-energy observations of the two periodic\nrepeaters FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B are extensively discussed. The recent outcome from the MWL\nobservations performed during the April 2020 SGR J1935+2154 active phase are illustrated in Section 6. Our\nconclusions are summarized in Section 7.\n\n2. Magnetars\n\nSoft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) are thought to be magnetars, that\nis, young neutron stars (NSs) with extremely high magnetic ﬁelds [51–53] and are among the candidates\nfor the sources of FRBs. About thirty magnetars [http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~pulsar/magnetar/\n\n\fUniverse 2021, 7, 76\n\n4 of 48\n\nmain.html] (accessed on 1 March 2021) are currently known in our Galaxy (and the Magellanic Clouds),\nﬁve of which exhibited transient radio pulsations. The recent detection of γ-ray emission simultaneous\nto a fast radio burst (FRB 20200428A) originated in the Galactic SGR J1935+2154 has demonstrated the\ncommon origin of these phenomena. However the energetic for this event is of the order of 10−6 times\nthat of a cosmological FRB at z ∼ 1. We should point out that recently bursts just one decade more\nenergetic than FRB 20200428A were observed for FRB 20180916B [54], so it is not clear if it represents\njust the tail of a population, as volumetric-rate estimates might suggest [8]. Assuming this is the case,\nnot only must emission models be able to explain the extremely wide range of radio ﬂuxes, but also the\nradio-to-γ-ray ﬂuence ratio of FRB 20200428A ((cid:39) 2–4 × 10−6 in [12] and, more reliably, 3 × 10−5 in [13]),\nwhich is more than ﬁve orders of magnitude greater than that of SGR 1806−20 as no FRB was observed\nin the giant 27 December 2004 outburst of this SGR [55]. The Galactic FRB 20200428A is by far the most\nradio-luminous such event detected from any Galactic magnetar. The brightest radio burst previously\nseen from a magnetar was during the 2009 outburst of 1E 1547.0–408 and was three orders of magnitude\nfainter. Thus, FRB 20200428A clearly suggests that magnetars can produce far brighter radio bursts than\nhas been previously known.\n\nThe prominent role of magnetars as promising candidates for extragalactic FRB sources has fostered a\nnumber of complementary attempts to identify counterparts or associations with other classes of known\nsources: since magnetars are believed to represent the endpoint of some core-collapsed progenitors of\nlong GRBs (e.g., [56–58]), as well as the result of a compact binary merger signalled by a short GRB\n(e.g., [59–61]), some of these GRB sources were targeted by radio follow-up observations, either within\nhours of the GRB or years later, to search for FRB emission [62–67]. Systematic and sensitive searches for\nemission compatible with MGFs from well localised FRB sources have also been carried out in parallel,\nboth independently of and simultaneously with radio observations, whose results and implications are\npresented in Section 6.\n\n3.
