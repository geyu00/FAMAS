This might include terms like \"H. pylori infection\", \"acne treatment\", or simply \"acne vulgaris\".\n   \n2. **Expand Date Range**: I can initially keep the date range as is to see if we get more results, but if that yields no results, I will consider exploring a larger timeframe.\n\nLet's first execute a revised search query with broader terms. Hereâ€™s how I will adjust the search query in the code:\n\n1. Search for \"H. pylori\" AND \"acne\" in a single query, as it may capture trials related to either term.\n2. Include other relevant variations that might apply to the treatment of acne vulgaris or research related to H. pylori.\n\nI will implement these changes and re-execute the code to see if we can find any trials.
