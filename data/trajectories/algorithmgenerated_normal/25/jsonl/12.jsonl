Which of these words is used to describe a type of society in a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016? Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify the figure with three axes in the AI regulation paper submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022, extract the label words at both ends of each axis, and check the Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016, for any of these label words. Determine which of these words is used to describe a type of society in the 2016 article.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The AI regulation expert will locate the figure with three axes in the June 2022 paper and extract the label words at both ends of each axis.\n2. The Physics and Society expert will check the August 2016 article for any of these label words and determine which one describes a type of society.\n3. The checker will verify the accuracy and consistency of the findings.\n\n## Output format\n- List of label words at both ends of each axis from the June 2022 paper.\n- The word used to describe a type of society in the August 2016 article.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure the label words are accurately extracted from the figure in the June 2022 paper.\n- Verify that the word describing a type of society in the August 2016 article matches one of the label words from the June 2022 paper."}

However, I will need the input from the AI regulation expert first to provide me with the label words extracted from the June 2022 paper.\n\nOnce the AI regulation expert provides the label words from the figure in the June 2022 paper, I will then compare them against the 2016 article to find which word describes a type of society.\n\nCould the AI regulation expert please share the label words from the June 2022 paper?"}

Once that is done, I can assist in verifying and discussing the findings related to the 2016 article.\n\nPlease go ahead with the extraction of label words from the June 2022 paper, and share them here when ready."}
