Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nDetermine the number of High Energy Physics - Lattice articles listed in January 2020 on Arxiv that had ps versions available.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Extract the list of High Energy Physics - Lattice articles from Arxiv for January 2020.\n2. Analyze the extracted data to identify which articles have ps versions available.\n3. Count the number of articles with ps versions available.\n\n## Output format\nThe output should be a single integer representing the number of articles with ps versions available.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The data should be accurately extracted from Arxiv for the specified category and time period.\n- The analysis should correctly identify and count the articles with ps versions available.\n\n## Results from last response\n0\n\n## Reason for the results\nNo High Energy Physics - Lattice articles were found for January 2020 on Arxiv, and thus none of these articles had ps versions available."}

Extract the list of High Energy Physics - Lattice articles from Arxiv for January 2020.\n2. Identify the articles that have ps versions available.\n3. Count those articles.\n\nFirst, I will extract the relevant articles. I will use the Arxiv API to gather this data. Here is the Python code to do that:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\ndef extract_hep_lattice_articles():\n    url = \"http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?\"\n    search_query = \"cat:hep-lat AND submittedDate:[2020-01-01 TO 2020-01-31]\"\n    max_results = 1000  # You can adjust this if necessary\n    query = f\"{url}search_query={search_query}&start=0&max_results={max_results}\"\n    \n    response = requests.get(query)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        return response.text\n    else:\n        return None\n\narticles_xml = extract_hep_lattice_articles()\nprint(articles_xml)  # Output the raw XML data for verification\n```\n\nI'll run this code in the Computer_terminal to extract the articles and review the XML response to verify if there are any articles available. Let's proceed with the execution."}
