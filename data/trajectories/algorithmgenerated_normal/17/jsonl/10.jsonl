According to Wikipedia as of January 1, 2021, what is the 2020 estimated population of that island, to the nearest thousand? Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nVerify the 2020 estimated population of Greenland according to Wikipedia as of January 1, 2021, ensuring the accuracy of the data.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Access the Wikipedia page for Greenland as of January 1, 2021.\n2. Locate the specific population data for 2020.\n3. Verify and confirm the population data.\n\n## Output format\nThe 2020 estimated population of Greenland, rounded to the nearest thousand.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The information must be accurate and verified from Wikipedia as of January 1, 2021.\n\n## Results from last response\nThe estimated population of Greenland in 2020, rounded to the nearest thousand, is 57,000. This was based on interpolation from 2022 data."}
