Order the list by the order in which the fractions appear. Please solve the problem carefully.The attached file path is: ../2023/validation/9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nAnalyze the provided image and extract all the fractions that use / as the fraction line. Then solve the sample problems and provide the answers.\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The image processing expert will analyze the image and extract all the fractions using / as the fraction line.\n2. The mathematical problem-solving expert will solve the extracted fractions.\n3. The checker will verify the accuracy of the extracted fractions and their solutions.\n## Output format\nProvide a comma-separated list with no whitespace, containing all the fractions and their solutions in the order they appear in the image.\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure all fractions using / as the fraction line are accurately extracted.\n- Ensure all sample problems are correctly solved.\n- Provide the output in the specified format.\n## Results from last response\nFinal Result: 3/4,1/4,2/4,5/35,1/21,30/5,3/4,1/4,1/2,1/7,1/21,6\n## Reason for the results\nThe team followed a structured plan:\n1. The ImageProcessing_Expert used OCR to extract text from the image, identifying the fractions.\n2. The ProblemSolving_Expert simplified and solved the fractions.\n3. The Verification_Expert compiled and verified the results.\n## Errors or issues in the conversation\n- The final result includes unsimplified fractions (2/4, 5/35, 30/5) alongside their simplified forms (1/2, 1/7, 6). Ideally, only the simplified forms should be included in the final result list, as per the task instructions to solve the fractions.\n### Need to double-check?\nYes\n## Additional information (file path, code blocks, url, etc.)\nFile path: ../2023/validation/9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png\nOCR function code:\n```python\nfrom functions import optical_character_recognition\n\n# Perform OCR on the provided image\nimage_path = \"../2023/validation/9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png\"\nextracted_text = optical_character_recognition(image_path)\nprint(extracted_text)\n```\nFraction solving code:\n```python\nfrom functions import fraction_to_mixed_numbers\n\n# Simplify and solve the extracted fractions\nfractions = [(3, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (5, 35), (1, 21), (30, 5)]\n\nsimplified_fractions = []\nfor num, denom in fractions:\n    simplified_fraction = fraction_to_mixed_numbers(num, denom)\n    simplified_fractions.append(simplified_fraction)\n\nprint(simplified_fractions)\n```"}
