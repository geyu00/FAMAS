{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase during this period.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - The transaction fees for each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each eligible fund at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each eligible fund over the specified period using the formula: \\((\\text{Ending Value} - \\text{Starting Value}) / \\text{Starting Value} \\times 100\\).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is likely that some funds may have experienced lower growth or even negative returns during this period.\n   - Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds typically focus on investments in developing countries, which can be more volatile than developed markets.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify Eligible Funds**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Fidelity's official website and find a list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n  - Verify which of these funds have $0 transaction fees.\n\n- **Collect Historical Data**\n  - For each eligible fund, use WebSurfer to find the net asset value (NAV) or share price at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024.\n  - Record this data in a structured format, such as a CSV file.\n\n- **Calculate Percentage Increase**\n  - Use Assistant to write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each fund over the specified period.\n  - Run the script using ComputerTerminal to process the data and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n- **Summarize and Report**\n  - Use Assistant to summarize the findings and provide the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n  - Ensure all steps are documented and results are clearly presented."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase during this period.\n   - Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) is one of the Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - The transaction fees for each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each eligible fund at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n   - Specific details on the transaction fees for Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each eligible fund over the specified period using the formula: \\((\\text{Ending Value} - \\text{Starting Value}) / \\text{Starting Value} \\times 100\\).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is likely that some funds may have experienced lower growth or even negative returns during this period.\n   - Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds typically focus on investments in developing countries, which can be more volatile than developed markets.\n   - The Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) is a prominent fund in this category, and it is likely that it has $0 transaction fees, as it is a widely recognized fund in the Fidelity lineup.\n   - Other Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds may also have $0 transaction fees, and we need to verify this information to ensure we are considering all eligible funds.\n   - The historical performance data for the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) is likely available on the Fidelity website or through financial databases, which will help us calculate the percentage increase for this fund.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Identify Eligible Funds**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Fidelity's official website and find a comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - Verify which of these funds have $0 transaction fees.\n\n2. **Collect Historical Data**\n   - For each eligible fund, use WebSurfer to find the net asset value (NAV) or share price at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024.\n   - Record this data in a structured format, such as a CSV file.\n\n3. **Calculate Percentage Increase**\n   - Use Assistant to write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each fund over the specified period.\n   - Run the script using ComputerTerminal to process the data and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n4. **Summarize and Report**\n   - Use Assistant to summarize the findings and provide the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   - Ensure all steps are documented and results are clearly presented.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues**: The WebSurfer was unable to navigate to the specific sections of the Fidelity website where the historical performance data for the mutual funds is located. This could be due to the website's structure, dynamic content loading, or the need for user interaction to access certain data.\n2. **Data Extraction Challenges**: Even when the WebSurfer managed to navigate to the correct pages, it was difficult to extract the specific data points (NAV or share prices) for the required time periods (May 2019 and May 2024).\n3. **User Interaction Requirements**: Some pages may require user interaction (like confirming client categories) before displaying the necessary data, which the WebSurfer did not handle effectively.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Identify Eligible Funds**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Fidelity's official website and search for a list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify which of these funds have $0 transaction fees by checking the transaction fee information on the fund pages or through a search query.\n\n2. **Collect Historical Data**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each eligible fund, navigate to the historical performance section of the fund's page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm the client category (e.g., Personal Investors) if required to access the data.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the net asset value (NAV) or share price at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the data is not directly available, use the search functionality to find the closest available dates and note them down.\n\n3. **Handle Dynamic Content and User Interaction**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the `sleep` function to wait for dynamic content to load fully before attempting to extract data.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on any necessary buttons or links to confirm client categories or navigate to the historical performance section.\n\n4. **Record Data in a Structured Format**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the extracted data in a structured format, such as a CSV file, including the fund name, ISIN, starting and ending NAV/share prices, and the dates used.\n\n5. **Calculate Percentage Increase**\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each fund over the specified period using the formula: \\((\\text{Ending Value} - \\text{Starting Value}) / \\text{Starting Value} \\times 100\\).\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script to process the data and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n6. **Summarize and Report**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   - **Assistant**: Ensure all steps are documented and results are clearly presented.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Identify Eligible Funds**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees\" on Fidelity's official website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of funds and verify their transaction fees.\n\n2. **Collect Historical Data**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each eligible fund, navigate to the fund's page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm the client category if required.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the historical performance section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the NAV/share price at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If exact dates are not available, use the closest available dates and note them down.\n\n3. **Handle Dynamic Content and User Interaction**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use `sleep(5)` to wait for dynamic content to load.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on any necessary buttons or links to confirm client categories or navigate to the historical performance section.\n\n4. **Record Data in a Structured Format**\n   -

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase during this period.\n   - Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) is one of the Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - The search for \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees\" on Bing returned several relevant results, including Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - The transaction fees for each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each eligible fund at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n   - Specific details on the transaction fees for Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each eligible fund over the specified period using the formula: \\((\\text{Ending Value} - \\text{Starting Value}) / \\text{Starting Value} \\times 100\\).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is likely that some funds may have experienced lower growth or even negative returns during this period.\n   - Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds typically focus on investments in developing countries, which can be more volatile than developed markets.\n   - The Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) is a prominent fund in this category, and it is likely that it has $0 transaction fees, as it is a widely recognized fund in the Fidelity lineup.\n   - Other Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds may also have $0 transaction fees, and we need to verify this information to ensure we are considering all eligible funds.\n   - The historical performance data for the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) is likely available on the Fidelity website or through financial databases, which will help us calculate the percentage increase for this fund.\n   - Since the search results on Bing included Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426), it is a strong candidate for further investigation. Other funds mentioned in the search results should also be considered, such as the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX).\n\n### New Educated Guesses\n- **Dynamic Content and User Interaction**: The issues encountered with the web browser might be due to the dynamic nature of the Fidelity website, which may require user interaction to load certain pages fully. Using a different approach, such as a more robust web scraping tool or manual verification, might be necessary.\n- **Alternative Sources**: If the Fidelity website continues to pose challenges, financial databases like Morningstar or financial news websites like Bloomberg might provide the necessary historical data more reliably.\n- **Multiple Funds**: There are likely multiple Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees. Verifying and comparing these funds will be crucial to identifying the one with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Identify Eligible Funds**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Fidelity's official website and find a comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - Verify which of these funds have $0 transaction fees by checking the transaction fee information on the fund pages or through a search query.\n   - If the Fidelity website remains challenging, use alternative sources like Morningstar or financial news websites to gather the same information.\n\n2. **Collect Historical Data**\n   - For each eligible fund, use WebSurfer to find the net asset value (NAV) or share price at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024.\n   - If the data is not directly available, use the search functionality to find the closest available dates and note them down.\n   - Record this data in a structured format, such as a CSV file.\n\n3. **Handle Dynamic Content and User Interaction**\n   - Use the `sleep` function to wait for dynamic content to load fully before attempting to extract data.\n   - Click on any necessary buttons or links to confirm client categories or navigate to the historical performance section.\n\n4. **Calculate Percentage Increase**\n   - Use Assistant to write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each fund over the specified period.\n   - Run the script using ComputerTerminal to process the data and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n5. **Summarize and Report**\n   - Use Assistant to summarize the findings and provide the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   - Ensure all steps are documented and results are clearly presented.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Identify Eligible Funds**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees\" on Fidelity's official website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of funds and verify their transaction fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the Fidelity website is uncooperative, use alternative sources like Morningstar or financial news websites to gather the same information.\n\n2. **Collect Historical Data**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each eligible fund, navigate to the fund's page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm the client category if required.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the historical performance section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the NAV/share price at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If exact dates are not available, use the closest available dates and note them down.\n\n3. **Handle Dynamic Content and User Interaction**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use `sleep(5)` to wait for dynamic content to load.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on any necessary buttons or links to confirm client categories or navigate to the historical performance section.\n\n4. **Record Data in a Structured Format**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Create a CSV file with columns: Fund Name, ISIN, Starting Date, Starting NAV/Share Price, Ending Date, Ending NAV/Share Price.\n\n5. **Calculate Percentage Increase**\n   - **Assistant**: Write the following Python script to calculate the percentage increase:\n     ```python\n     import csv\n\n     def calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n         return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\n     # Read the CSV file\n     with open('funds_data.csv', mode='r') as file:\n         reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n         funds = [row for row in reader]\n\n     # Calculate percentage increase for each fund\n     for fund in funds:\n         start_value = float(fund['Starting NAV/Share Price'])\n         end_value = float(fund['Ending NAV/Share Price'])\n         fund['Percentage Increase'] = calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value)\n\n     # Find the fund with the lowest percentage increase\n     lowest_increase_fund = min(funds, key=lambda x: x['Percentage Increase'])\n\n     print(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is: {lowest_increase_fund['Fund Name']} with a percentage increase of {lowest_increase_fund['Percentage Increase']}%.\")\n     ```\n\n6. **Run the Script**\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script using:\n     ```sh\n     python3 calculate_percentage_increase.py\n     ```\n\n7. **Summarize and Report**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   - **Assistant**: Document all steps and ensure the results are clearly presented.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step by using WebSurfer to navigate to Fidelity's official website and find a comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees. If the Fidelity website continues to pose challenges, we will switch to alternative sources like Morningstar.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Network Issues**: The web browser encountered a `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` when trying to navigate to the Fidelity website. This could be due to network instability, server issues, or browser configuration problems.\n2. **Dynamic Content Loading**: The Fidelity website may use dynamic content loading, which requires user interaction or additional time to fully load. The previous attempts did not account for this, leading to incomplete data extraction.\n3. **User Interaction Requirements**: Some pages on the Fidelity website may require user interaction (e.g., confirming client categories) before displaying the necessary data. The WebSurfer did not handle these interactions effectively.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Alternative Sources**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to financial databases like Morningstar or financial news websites like Bloomberg to find a list of Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the transaction fees and historical performance data for these funds.\n\n2. **Handle Dynamic Content and User Interaction**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the `sleep` function to wait for dynamic content to load fully before attempting to extract data.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on any necessary buttons or links to confirm client categories or navigate to the historical performance section.\n\n3. **Record Data in a Structured Format**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Create a CSV file with columns: Fund Name, ISIN, Starting Date, Starting NAV/Share Price, Ending Date, Ending NAV/Share Price.\n\n4. **Calculate Percentage Increase**\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each fund over the specified period.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script to process the data and identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n5. **Summarize and Report**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   - **Assistant**: Document all steps and ensure the results are clearly presented.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Use Alternative Sources**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Morningstar's website and search for \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of funds and verify their transaction fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If necessary, navigate to individual fund pages to find the net asset value (NAV) or share price at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024.\n\n2. **Handle Dynamic Content and User Interaction**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use `sleep(5)` to wait for dynamic content to load.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on any necessary buttons or links to confirm client categories or navigate to the historical performance section.\n\n3. **Record Data in a Structured Format**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Create a CSV file with the following columns: Fund Name, ISIN, Starting Date, Starting NAV/Share Price, Ending Date, Ending NAV/Share Price.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the extracted data in this CSV file.\n\n4. **Calculate Percentage Increase**\n   - **Assistant**: Write the following Python script to calculate the percentage increase:\n     ```python\n     import csv\n\n     def calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n         return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\n     # Read the CSV file\n     with open('funds_data.csv', mode='r') as file:\n         reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n         funds = [row for row in reader]\n\n     # Calculate percentage increase for each fund\n     for fund in funds:\n         start_value = float(fund['Starting NAV/Share Price'])\n         end_value = float(fund['Ending NAV/Share Price'])\n         fund['Percentage Increase'] = calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value)\n\n     # Find the fund with the lowest percentage increase\n     lowest_increase_fund = min(funds, key=lambda x: x['Percentage Increase'])\n\n     print(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is: {lowest_increase_fund['Fund Name']} with a percentage increase of {lowest_increase_fund['Percentage Increase']}%.\")\n     ```\n\n5. **Run the Script**\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script using:\n     ```sh\n     python3 calculate_percentage_increase.py\n     ```\n\n6. **Summarize and Report**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   - **Assistant**: Document all steps and ensure the results are clearly presented.\n\n### Initial Step\n\nPlease navigate to Morningstar's website and search for \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees\".

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser.

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase during this period.\n   - Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) is one of the Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - The search for \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees\" on Bing returned several relevant results, including Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - The transaction fees for each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each eligible fund at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n   - Specific details on the transaction fees for Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each eligible fund over the specified period using the formula: \\((\\text{Ending Value} - \\text{Starting Value}) / \\text{Starting Value} \\times 100\\).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is likely that some funds may have experienced lower growth or even negative returns during this period.\n   - Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds typically focus on investments in developing countries, which can be more volatile than developed markets.\n   - The Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) is a prominent fund in this category, and it is likely that it has $0 transaction fees, as it is a widely recognized fund in the Fidelity lineup.\n   - Other Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds may also have $0 transaction fees, and we need to verify this information to ensure we are considering all eligible funds.\n   - The historical performance data for the Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426) is likely available on the Fidelity website or through financial databases, which will help us calculate the percentage increase for this fund.\n   - Since the search results on Bing included Fidelity Funds - Emerging Markets Fund A-USD (ISIN: LU0048575426), it is a strong candidate for further investigation. Other funds mentioned in the search results should also be considered, such as the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX).\n\n### New Educated Guesses\n- **Dynamic Content and User Interaction**: The issues encountered with the web browser might be due to the dynamic nature of the Fidelity website, which may require user interaction to load certain pages fully. Using a different approach, such as a more robust web scraping tool or manual verification, might be necessary.\n- **Alternative Sources**: If the Fidelity website continues to pose challenges, financial databases like Morningstar or financial news websites like Bloomberg might provide the necessary historical data more reliably.\n- **Multiple Funds**: There are likely multiple Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees. Verifying and comparing these funds will be crucial to identifying the one with the lowest percentage increase.\n- **Manual Verification**: Given the repeated issues with automated navigation, manually verifying the data from the Fidelity website or Morningstar might be the most reliable approach. This involves manually navigating to the relevant pages and recording the necessary data.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Identify Eligible Funds**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Fidelity's official website and find a comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify which of these funds have $0 transaction fees by checking the transaction fee information on the fund pages or through a search query.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the Fidelity website remains challenging, use alternative sources like Morningstar or financial news websites to gather the same information.\n\n2. **Collect Historical Data**\n   -

**Assistant**: Document all steps and ensure the results are clearly presented.\n\n### Initial Step\n\nPlease navigate to the 'Funds' section on the Morningstar website and search for 'Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees'. Extract the list of funds and verify their transaction fees. If necessary, navigate to individual fund pages to find the net asset value (NAV) or share price at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024. Record this data in a structured format, such as a CSV file. If the Fidelity website continues to pose challenges, manually verify the data from the Fidelity website or Morningstar.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Dynamic Content and User Interaction**: The Fidelity website and possibly Morningstar use dynamic content loading and require user interaction to fully load certain pages. Automated navigation and data extraction were hindered by this.\n2. **Network Issues**: There were network issues, such as `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`, which prevented successful navigation to the Fidelity website.\n3. **Incorrect Navigation**: The WebSurfer was directed to click on irrelevant links, such as articles, instead of navigating to the 'Funds' section where the necessary data is located.\n4. **Lack of Robust Error Handling**: The scripts and instructions did not account for potential errors or delays in page loading, leading to failed attempts to interact with elements that were not yet present on the page.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the 'Funds' Section on Morningstar**:\n   -

Automated navigation and data extraction were hindered by this.\n3. **Network Issues**: There were network issues, such as `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`, which prevented successful navigation to the Fidelity website.\n4. **Incorrect Navigation**: The WebSurfer was directed to click on irrelevant links, such as articles, instead of navigating to the 'Funds' section where the necessary data is located.\n5. **Lack of Robust Error Handling**: The scripts and instructions did not account for potential errors or delays in page loading, leading to failed attempts to interact with elements that were not yet present on the page.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Complete Human Verification Manually**:\n   - **User**: Manually complete the human verification step on the Morningstar website by selecting all the buckets and confirming.\n\n2. **Navigate to the 'Funds' Section on Morningstar**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Morningstar website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Funds' section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search bar to search for 'Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use `sleep(5)` to wait for the search results to load fully.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of funds and verify their transaction fees.\n\n3. **Collect Historical Data for Each Fund**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each eligible fund, navigate to the fund's page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm the client category if required.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the historical performance section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use `sleep(5)` to wait for the historical data to load fully.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the NAV/share price at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If exact dates are not available, use the closest available dates and note them down.\n\n4. **Record Data in a Structured Format**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Create a CSV file with columns: Fund Name, ISIN, Starting Date, Starting NAV/Share Price, Ending Date, Ending NAV/Share Price.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the extracted data in this CSV file.\n\n5. **Calculate Percentage Increase**:\n   - **Assistant**: Write the following Python script to calculate the percentage increase:\n     ```python\n     import csv\n\n     def calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n         return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\n     # Read the CSV file\n     with open('funds_data.csv', mode='r') as file:\n         reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n         funds = [row for row in reader]\n\n     # Calculate percentage increase for each fund\n     for fund in funds:\n         start_value = float(fund['Starting NAV/Share Price'])\n         end_value = float(fund['Ending NAV/Share Price'])\n         fund['Percentage Increase'] = calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value)\n\n     # Find the fund with the lowest percentage increase\n     lowest_increase_fund = min(funds, key=lambda x: x['Percentage Increase'])\n\n     print(f\"The fund with the lowest percentage increase is: {lowest_increase_fund['Fund Name']} with a percentage increase of {lowest_increase_fund['Percentage Increase']}%.\")\n     ```\n\n6. **Run the Script**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script using:\n     ```sh\n     python3 calculate_percentage_increase.py\n     ```\n\n7. **Summarize and Report**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n   - **Assistant**: Document all steps and ensure the results are clearly presented.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Complete Human Verification Manually**\n   - **User**: Manually complete the human verification step on the Morningstar website by selecting all the buckets and confirming.\n\n2. **Navigate to the 'Funds' Section on Morningstar**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Morningstar website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Funds' section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search bar to search for 'Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use `sleep(5)` to wait for the search results to load fully.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of funds and verify their transaction fees.\n\n3. **Collect Historical Data for Each Fund**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each eligible fund, navigate to the fund's page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm the client category if required.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the historical performance section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use `sleep(5)` to wait for the historical data to load fully.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the NAV/share price at the beginning of May 2019 and the end of May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If exact dates are not available, use the closest available dates and note them down.\n\n4. **Record Data in a Structured Format**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Create a CSV file with columns: Fund Name, ISIN, Starting Date, Starting NAV/Share Price, Ending Date, Ending NAV/Share Price.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the extracted data in this CSV file.\n\n5. **Calculate Percentage Increase**\n   - **Assistant**: Write the following Python script to calculate the percentage increase:\n     ```python\n     import csv\n\n     def calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value):\n         return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100\n\n     #
