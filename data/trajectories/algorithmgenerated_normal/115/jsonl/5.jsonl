{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "Based on the previously provided numbers, the costs were stated as follows:\n\n- Cost of a daily ticket: $60\n- Cost of a season pass: $120\n\nLet's proceed with these values for the calculations.\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of visiting once a month for four months using daily tickets:\n   - Total cost of daily tickets = Daily ticket price × Number of visits\n   - Total cost of daily tickets = $60 × 4 = $240\n\n2. Compare the total cost of daily tickets with the cost of a season pass:\n   - Cost of a season pass: $120\n   - Savings by purchasing a season pass = Total cost of daily tickets - Cost of a season pass\n   - Savings = $240 - $120 = $120\n\nThus, by purchasing a season pass, you would save $120 compared to buying daily tickets for four visits.\n\nIf everyone is in agreement with this calculation, we can conclude the discussion. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed!"}

The total cost of visiting once a month for four months using daily tickets is indeed calculated as:\n   - Total cost of daily tickets = $60 × 4 = $240\n\n2. The comparison with the cost of a season pass shows:\n   - Savings by purchasing a season pass = $240 - $120 = $120\n\nThis confirms that you would save $120 by opting for a season pass instead of daily tickets.\n\nIf everyone agrees with the findings and calculations, we can proceed to conclude the discussion.
