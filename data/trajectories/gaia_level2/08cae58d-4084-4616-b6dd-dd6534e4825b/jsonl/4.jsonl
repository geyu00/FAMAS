{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is to find the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n   - The source to verify this information is Google Finance.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance.\n   - The specific date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are needed beyond identifying the date or year from the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone several splits over the years, so the $50 threshold without adjustment likely occurred in the early to mid-2000s, given the company's growth trajectory during that period. However, this is a guess and needs verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to navigate to Google Finance and search for Apple (AAPL) historical stock prices.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to locate and extract the historical price data, focusing on the earliest date when the stock price first exceeded $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n- **Step 3:** Verify the extracted date or year to ensure accuracy.\n- **Step 4:** Report the findings back to the user."}

It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade.\nHistorical

Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is to find the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n   - The source to verify this information is Google Finance.\n   - We have accessed the historical prices section on Google Finance for Apple (AAPL).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance, specifically focusing on the period before the recent years.\n   - The specific date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are needed beyond identifying the date or year from the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone several splits over the years, so the $50 threshold without adjustment likely occurred in the early to mid-2000s, given the company's growth trajectory during that period. However, this is a guess and needs verification.\n   - Based on the historical data visible on Google Finance, it appears that the stock price was below $50 in the late 2020s. Therefore, the year we are looking for is likely earlier than 2023. This narrows our search to the period between 2000 and 2022.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The historical data we have seen so far shows that the stock price was well above $50 in recent years (2023 and 2024). However, it was below $50 in the late 2020s, which suggests that the crossover point is likely in the earlier part of the 2000s or 2010s.\n- Given Apple's significant growth and the multiple stock splits, it is reasonable to assume that the stock price crossed $50 in the early to mid-2000s, aligning with the company's rapid expansion during that period.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Continue to scroll through the historical prices section on Google Finance to find the exact date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Scrolling Inefficiency**: The repeated scrolling down did not efficiently locate the historical price data for the desired period. The viewport did not consistently show the relevant data, leading to wasted attempts.\n2. **Lack of Specific Search**: Instead of scrolling manually, a more targeted approach to find the specific historical price data was needed.\n3. **Inconsistent Viewport**: The viewport often showed irrelevant sections of the page, such as financial statements, which did not contain the historical price data.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Historical Prices Directly**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate directly to the historical prices section of the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance.\n   - Click on the \"Historical prices\" tab or similar link to access the detailed historical price data.\n\n2. **Adjust Time Range**:\n   - Set the time range to a longer period, such as \"MAX\" or \"10Y\", to ensure we cover the entire history of the stock.\n\n3. **Search for Specific Year**:\n   - Use the search functionality within the historical prices table to look for the year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n   - If a search function is not available, scroll through the data systematically, starting from the earliest available dates.\n\n4. **Extract and Verify the Date**:\n   - Identify the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n   - Verify the extracted date or year to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Report the Findings**:\n   - Report the findings back to the user with the specific date or year when the Apple stock first went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance.\n- **Step 2**: Click on the \"Historical prices\" tab or similar link to access the detailed historical price data.\n- **Step 3**: Set the time range to \"MAX\" or \"10Y\" to cover the entire history.\n- **Step 4**: Use the search functionality within the historical prices table to look for the year when the stock price first exceeded $50. If a search function is not available, scroll through the data systematically, starting from the earliest available dates.\n- **Step 5**: Identify and verify the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n- **Step 6**: Report the findings back to the user.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan.\n\n### Execution\n\nPlease navigate to the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance and click on the \"Historical prices\" tab or similar link to access the detailed historical price data. Then, set the time range to \"MAX\" or \"10Y\" to cover the entire history."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is to find the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n   - The source to verify this information is Google Finance.\n   - We have accessed the historical prices section on Google Finance for Apple (AAPL).\n   - The historical prices chart on Google Finance shows data from 1990 to the present.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance, specifically focusing on the period before the recent years.\n   - The specific date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are needed beyond identifying the date or year from the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone several splits over the years, so the $50 threshold without adjustment likely occurred in the early to mid-2000s, given the company's growth trajectory during that period. However, this is a guess and needs verification.\n   - Based on the historical data visible on Google Finance, it appears that the stock price was below $50 in the late 2020s. Therefore, the year we are looking for is likely earlier than 2023. This narrows our search to the period between 2000 and 2022.\n   - The stock price chart shows a significant increase in the early 2000s, which aligns with Apple's introduction of the iPod and the subsequent growth in consumer electronics.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The historical data chart on Google Finance shows a gradual increase in stock price starting from the early 2000s, which is consistent with Apple's major product launches and market expansion during that period.\n- The stock price was below $50 in the late 2020s, which confirms that the crossover point is likely in the earlier part of the 2000s or 2010s.\n- Given the significant milestones and product launches (i.e., iPod, iPhone), it is reasonable to assume that the stock price crossed $50 in the early to mid-2000s.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Continue to scroll through the historical prices section on Google Finance to find the exact date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n- Focus on the period between 2000 and 2010, as this is the most likely timeframe for the crossover point.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the 'Historical prices' tab on the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance.\n- **Step 2**: Set the time range to 'MAX' or '10Y' to cover the entire history.\n- **Step 3**: Scroll through the historical prices data, focusing on the period between 2000 and 2010.\n- **Step 4**: Identify the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n- **Step 5**: Verify the extracted date or year to ensure accuracy.\n- **Step 6**: Report the findings back to the user.\n\nPlease continue scrolling through the historical prices data and identify the earliest date or year when the Apple stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The previous attempts involved clicking on irrelevant sections of the page, such as 'About', instead of navigating directly to the 'Historical prices' tab.\n2. **Inefficient Scrolling**: The scrolling was not systematic, and the viewport often showed irrelevant sections of the page, such as news articles and financial statements, rather than the historical price data.\n3. **Lack of Specific Search**: There was no targeted approach to find the specific historical price data, leading to wasted attempts and inefficiency.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Historical Prices**:\n   - **Action**: Click on the 'Historical prices' tab on the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance.\n   - **Hint**: Ensure the tab is selected and the historical prices section is visible.\n\n2. **Set Time Range**:\n   - **Action**: Set the time range to 'MAX' to cover the entire history of the stock.\n   - **Hint**: This will ensure we have access to all historical data.\n\n3. **Scroll Systematically**:\n   - **Action**: Scroll through the historical prices data, focusing on the period between 2000 and 2010.\n   - **Hint**: Start from the earliest available dates and move forward until the stock price exceeds $50.\n\n4. **Identify the Crossover Point**:\n   - **Action**: Identify the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n   - **Hint**: Look for the first instance where the closing price is above $50.\n\n5. **Verify the Date**:\n   - **Action**: Double-check the identified date or year to ensure accuracy.\n   - **Hint**: Cross-reference with adjacent dates to confirm the crossover point.\n\n6. **Report the Findings**:\n   - **Action**: Report the findings back to the user with the specific date or year when the Apple stock first went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the 'Historical prices' tab on the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance.\n- **Step 2**: Set the time range to 'MAX'.\n- **Step 3**: Scroll through the historical prices data, starting from the earliest available dates.\n- **Step 4**: Identify the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n- **Step 5**: Verify the extracted date or year to ensure accuracy.\n- **Step 6**: Report the findings back to the user.\n\nPlease navigate to the 'Historical prices' tab on the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance and set the time range to 'MAX'. Then, start scrolling through the data to find the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50."}

It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no,minimal-ui\",\n        \"google-site-verification\": \"sxp7zFOFUzk09RdlFhuH2SoCn5nOkXgomiLeLIQ48p0\",\n        \"mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"application-name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-title\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\": \"default\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"msapplication-tap-highlight\": \"no\",\n        \"description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_770x402.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"770\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"402\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary\",\n        \"twitter:site\": \"@google\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_496x496.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and refined educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is to find the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n   - The source to verify this information is Google Finance.\n   - We have accessed the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance.\n   - The historical prices chart on Google Finance shows data from 1990 to the present.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance, specifically focusing on the period before the recent years.\n   - The specific date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are needed beyond identifying the date or year from the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone several splits over the years, so the $50 threshold without adjustment likely occurred in the early to mid-2000s, given the company's growth trajectory during that period. However, this is a guess and needs verification.\n   - Based on the historical data visible on Google Finance, it appears that the stock price was below $50 in the late 2020s. Therefore, the year we are looking for is likely earlier than 2023. This narrows our search to the period between 2000 and 2022.\n   - The stock price chart shows a significant increase in the early 2000s, which aligns with Apple's introduction of the iPod and the subsequent growth in consumer electronics.\n   - Given the significant milestones and product launches (i.e., iPod, iPhone), it is reasonable to assume that the stock price crossed $50 in the early to mid-2000s.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The historical data chart on Google Finance shows a gradual increase in stock price starting from the early 2000s, which is consistent with Apple's major product launches and market expansion during that period.\n- The stock price was below $50 in the late 2020s, which confirms that the crossover point is likely in the earlier part of the 2000s or 2010s.\n- Given the significant milestones and product launches (i.e., iPod, iPhone), it is reasonable to assume that the stock price crossed $50 in the early to mid-2000s.\n- Specifically, the introduction of the iPod in 2001 and the subsequent success of the product likely contributed to a significant rise in the stock price around that time.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Navigate to the 'Historical prices' tab on the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance.\n- Set the time range to 'MAX' to cover the entire history.\n- Scroll through the historical prices data, focusing on the period between 2000 and 2010.\n- Identify the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n- Verify the extracted date or year to ensure accuracy.\n- Report the findings back to the user.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the 'Historical prices' tab on the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance.\n- **Step 2**: Set the time range to 'MAX'.\n- **Step 3**: Scroll through the historical prices data, starting from the earliest available dates.\n- **Step 4**: Identify the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n- **Step 5**: Verify the extracted date or year to ensure accuracy.\n- **Step 6**: Report the findings back to the user.\n\nPlease navigate to the 'Historical prices' tab on the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance and set the time range to 'MAX'. Then, start scrolling through the data to find the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**:\n   - The previous attempts involved clicking on irrelevant sections of the page, such as 'About', instead of navigating directly to the 'Historical prices' tab.\n2. **Inefficient Scrolling**:\n   - The scrolling was not systematic, and the viewport often showed irrelevant sections of the page, such as news articles and financial statements, rather than the historical price data.\n3. **Lack of Specific Search**:\n   - There was no targeted approach to find the specific historical price data, leading to wasted attempts and inefficiency.\n4. **Repetition of Mistakes**:\n   - Despite multiple attempts, the same mistakes were repeated, indicating a need for a more structured and detailed plan.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - **Action**: Open the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance.\n   - **Hint**: Ensure the URL is `https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ`.\n\n2. **Locate the 'Historical prices' Tab**:\n   - **Action**: Click on the 'Historical prices' tab.\n   - **Hint**: This tab is typically located near the top of the page, below the main stock information.\n\n3. **Set the Time Range to 'MAX'**:\n   - **Action**: Set the time range to 'MAX' to cover the entire history of the stock.\n   - **Hint**: This will ensure we have access to all historical data.\n\n4. **Scroll Through the Data Systematically**:\n   - **Action**: Scroll through the historical prices data, starting from the earliest available dates.\n   - **Hint**: Focus on the period between 2000 and 2010, as this is the most likely timeframe for the crossover point.\n\n5. **Identify the Crossover Point**:\n   - **Action**: Identify the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n   - **Hint**: Look for the first instance where the closing price is above $50.\n\n6. **Verify the Date**:\n   - **Action**: Double-check the identified date or year to ensure accuracy.\n   - **Hint**: Cross-reference with adjacent dates to confirm the crossover point.\n\n7. **Report the Findings**:\n   - **Action**: Report the findings back to the user with the specific date or year when the Apple stock first went above $50 (without adjusting for stock splits).\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1**: Open the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance.\n  - **URL**: `https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ`\n- **Step 2**: Click on the 'Historical prices' tab.\n- **Step 3**: Set the time range to 'MAX'.\n- **Step 4**: Scroll through the historical prices data, starting from the earliest available dates.\n- **Step 5**: Identify the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n- **Step 6**: Verify the extracted date or year to ensure accuracy.\n- **Step 7**: Report the findings back to the user.\n\nPlease follow these steps to navigate to the 'Historical prices' tab on the Apple (AAPL) stock page on Google Finance, set the time range to 'MAX', and start scrolling through the data to find the earliest date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50."}

It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no,minimal-ui\",\n        \"google-site-verification\": \"sxp7zFOFUzk09RdlFhuH2SoCn5nOkXgomiLeLIQ48p0\",\n        \"mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"application-name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-title\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\": \"default\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"msapplication-tap-highlight\": \"no\",\n        \"description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_770x402.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"770\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"402\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary\",\n        \"twitter:site\": \"@google\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_496x496.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
