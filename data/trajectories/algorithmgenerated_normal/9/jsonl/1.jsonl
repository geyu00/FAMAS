{"agent": "GameTheory_Expert", "content": "Let's solve the problem step by step following the outlined plan.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Constraints and Conditions\n\nWe have three prize boxes, and the total number of coins is 30. The constraints are:\n1. One box must contain at least 2 coins.\n2. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.\n\nLet's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as \\( x, y, z \\), where \\( x \\leq y \\leq z \\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine Possible Values for the Number of Coins\n\nBased on the constraints:\n- Since one box must have at least 2 coins, we can set the minimum value for the first box, say \\( x \\geq 2 \\).\n- We also know that \\( z = y + 6 \\).\n\nThis gives us the equations:\n1. \\( x + y + z = 30 \\)\n2. \\( z = y + 6 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( z \\) into the total:\n\\[ x + y + (y + 6) = 30 \\]\n\\[ x + 2y + 6 = 30 \\]\n\\[ x + 2y = 24 \\]\nThus, we can express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[ x = 24 - 2y \\]\n\nNow, since \\( x \\) must be at least 2:\n\\[ 24 - 2y \\geq 2 \\]\n\\[ 22 \\geq 2y \\]\n\\[ y \\leq 11 \\]\n\nGiven \\( x \\leq y \\), let's find feasible values for \\( y \\) in a range:\n- If \\( y = 11 \\), then \\( x = 24 - 2(11) = 2\\) and \\( z = 11 + 6 = 17\\).\n- If \\( y = 10 \\), then \\( x = 24 - 2(10) = 4\\) and \\( z = 10 + 6 = 16\\).\n- If \\( y = 9 \\), then \\( x = 24 - 2(9) = 6\\) and \\( z = 9 + 6 = 15\\).\n- If \\( y = 8 \\), then \\( x = 24 - 2(8) = 8\\) and \\( z = 8 + 6 = 14\\).\n- If \\( y = 7 \\), then \\( x = 24 - 2(7) = 10\\) and \\( z = 7 + 6 = 13\\).\n- If \\( y = 6 \\), then \\( x = 24 - 2(6) = 12\\) and \\( z = 6 + 6 = 12\\).\n\nFeasible combinations of (x, y, z):\n- (2, 11, 17)\n- (4, 10, 16)\n- (6, 9, 15)\n- (8, 8, 14)\n- (10, 7, 13)\n- (12, 6, 12)\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Strategy\n\nBob's guesses should be based on the distribution of coins:\n1. For each distribution, Bob can maximize his winnings by guessing numbers that will ensure he wins the maximum number of coins according to the guessed values.\n\nGiven the distributions, Bob should aim to guess numbers as follows:\n- He should try to guess numbers that equal the number of coins in the boxes to maximize his winnings.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Minimum Amount Bob Can Win\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum amount Bob can win given optimal guesses for the configurations above.\n\n1. For (2, 11, 17): If he guesses (2, 11, 17), he wins 2 + 11 + 17 = 30 coins.\n2. For (4, 10, 16): Guesses (4, 10, 16), he wins 4 + 10 + 16 = 30 coins.\n3. For (6, 9, 15): Guesses (6, 9, 15), he wins 6 + 9 + 15 = 30 coins.\n4. For (8, 8, 14): Guesses (8, 8, 14), he wins 8 + 8 + 14 = 30 coins.\n5. For (10, 7, 13): Guesses (10, 7, 13), he wins 10 + 7 + 13 = 30 coins.\n6. For (12, 6, 12): Guesses (12, 6, 12), he wins 12 + 6 + 12 = 30 coins.\n\nRegardless of the guesses, the minimum Bob can win is 30 coins, which equates to:\n\\[ 30 \\times 1000 = 30000 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game, using the optimal strategy, is **$30,000**. \n\nNow let's verify the calculations with a simple code snippet to compute winnings based on optimal guesses:\n\n```python\n# Optimal guesses based on coin configurations\nconfigurations = [(2, 11, 17), (4, 10, 16), (6, 9, 15), (8, 8, 14), (10, 7, 13), (12, 6, 12)]\nmin_winning_coins = 0\n\nfor config in configurations:\n    winning_coins = sum(config)\n    if min_winning_coins == 0 or winning_coins < min_winning_coins:\n        min_winning_coins = winning_coins\n\nmin_winning_money = min_winning_coins * 1000\nprint(min_winning_money)\n```\n\nI will now run this code to verify the minimum winnings. \n\n```sh\npython3 -c \"configurations = [(2, 11, 17), (4, 10, 16), (6, 9, 15), (8, 8, 14), (10, 7, 13), (12, 6, 12)]; min_winning_coins = 0; for config in configurations: winning_coins = sum(config); if min_winning_coins == 0 or winning_coins < min_winning_coins: min_winning_coins = winning_coins; min_winning_money = min_winning_coins * 1000; print(min_winning_money)\"\n```"}
