Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sentence structure in Tizin is Verb-Object-Subject.\n   - \"Pa\" is the nominative form for oneself.\n   - \"Mato\" is the accusative form for oneself.\n   - \"Sing\" is the genitive form for oneself.\n   - The root verb \"Maktay\" indicates an intense like for something.\n   - \"Maktay\" is used in its root form in the present tense.\n   - \"Tay\" is the preterit past form of \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Aktay\" is the imperfect past form of \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Maktay\" is better translated as \"is pleasing to\".\n   - \"Apple\" is the nominative form for apples.\n   - \"Zapple\" is the accusative form for apples.\n   - \"Izapple\" is the genitive form for apples.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - No specific facts need to be looked up as all necessary information is provided in the request.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The correct form of the verb \"Maktay\" to use in the present tense.\n   - The correct form of the noun \"Apple\" to use as the direct object.\n   - The correct form of the pronoun \"Pa\" to use as the subject.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Since \"Maktay\" is used in its root form in the present tense, we will use \"Maktay\" in our translation.\n   - Since \"Apple\" is the nominative form and we need the accusative form (as it is the direct object), we will use \"Zapple\".\n   - Since \"Pa\" is the nominative form and we need the subject form, we will use \"Pa\".\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Confirm the sentence structure in Tizin: Verb-Object-Subject.\n- Identify the correct forms of the words:\n  - Use \"Maktay\" for the present tense verb.\n  - Use \"Zapple\" for the accusative form of \"apple\" (direct object).\n  - Use \"Pa\" for the nominative form of oneself (subject).\n- Construct the sentence in Tizin using the identified forms.\n- Verify the constructed sentence against the given rules to ensure accuracy.\n- Provide the final translation of \"I like apples\" to Tizin."}
