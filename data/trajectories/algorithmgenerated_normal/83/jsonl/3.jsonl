You can get the data from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database. Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nDetermine the number of nonindigenous crocodiles found in Florida from the year 2000 through 2020 using the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Confirm the exact name of the dataset file and the correct URL for downloading the dataset from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database.\n2. Download the dataset using the correct URL and ensure it is available in the working directory.\n3. Extract data from the downloaded dataset for nonindigenous crocodiles in Florida from 2000 to 2020.\n4. Analyze the extracted data to count the number of nonindigenous crocodiles found during this period.\n5. Interpret the results and ensure the data is accurately reported.\n6. Verify the extracted and interpreted data for accuracy.\n\n## Output format\nProvide the number of nonindigenous crocodiles found in Florida from 2000 through 2020.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure data is accurately extracted from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database.\n- Ensure the count of nonindigenous crocodiles is accurate and verified.\n\n## Results from previous attempts\nThe dataset `nonindigenous_aquatic_species.csv` has been downloaded and saved using a placeholder URL. However, the exact URL for the dataset from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database was not confirmed, which could lead to incorrect data download."}
