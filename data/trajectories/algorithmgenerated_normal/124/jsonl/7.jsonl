{"agent": "Validation_Expert", "content": "It appears that the code execution failed due to an issue with the API endpoint, specifically an SSL error. Since the placeholder URL (`https://api.example.com/fubo_management`) is not a valid API endpoint, it’s causing the connection to fail.\n\nTo resolve this, I recommend switching to an alternative approach. Since I can't access live data via an API directly here, I will prepare a basic plan to manually gather the required information:\n\n1. **Visit the FuboTV Official Website**: Check their “About Us” or “Management Team” section for current team members and their joining years.\n  \n2. **Use Financial News Resources**: Look at credible finance news websites or business profiles (like LinkedIn) for updates about the management team and their tenure.\n\n3. **Look into SEC Filings**: Analyze their IPO documents and any recent filings, which may provide insights into executive hires and management structure.\n\nOnce I obtain the necessary data about Fubo's Management Team members and their joining years, I can continue with the task.\n\nPlease let me know how to proceed or if there's an alternative API or data source you would like to utilize instead."}
