{"agent": "SpeciesSightingsData_Expert", "content": "It seems the execution of the Bing search query has resulted in no output. This could be due to several factors, such as an incorrect subscription key, limitations in the query results, or other issues related to the API.\n\nTo proceed, I recommend verifying that the API key is correct and that it has the necessary permissions for the search capabilities. Additionally, we might want to refine the query to ensure we're targeting relevant information more effectively.\n\nSince I'm unable to run the Bing API directly here, let's consider utilizing historical databases and publications regarding the American Alligator for additional context instead. \n\nI can assist in suggesting alternative databases or resources that can be accessed to verify the year of the sighting in California.
