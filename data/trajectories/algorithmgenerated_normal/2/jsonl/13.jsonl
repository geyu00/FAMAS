{"agent": "DataAnalysis_Expert", "content": "To solve this task, I'll start by collecting the relevant data regarding the number of athletes each country sent to the 1928 Summer Olympics. I'll assume that we have a CSV file containing the data with columns for the IOC country code and the number of athletes.\n\nLet's outline the steps I'll take:\n\n1. Load the CSV data into a DataFrame using pandas.\n2. Filter the DataFrame to focus only on the year 1928.\n3. Identify the country with the least number of athletes.\n4. Handle any ties by sorting the results alphabetically by country name.\n5. Extract and print the IOC country code of the identified country.\n\nPlease provide the CSV file containing the athletes' data to proceed. If you have the file ready, I can write the code for it."}
