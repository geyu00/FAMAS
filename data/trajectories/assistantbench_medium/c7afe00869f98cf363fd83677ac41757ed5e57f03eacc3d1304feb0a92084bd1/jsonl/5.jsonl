Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific IMDB ratings for Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The current availability of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which of Daniel Craig's movies meet all the criteria: high IMDB rating, less than 150 minutes, and available on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, \"No Time to Die\" and \"Skyfall\" are highly rated Daniel Craig movies, but their runtimes and current availability on Netflix (US) need verification.\n   - \"Kingsman: The Golden Circle,\" while featuring Daniel Craig, is not a primary role and its availability and runtime need to be checked.\n   - \"Logan Lucky\" is another film with Daniel Craig, and it is generally well-received, but its IMDB rating and Netflix availability need confirmation.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the list of Daniel Craig's movies and their IMDB ratings**:\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for a reliable source (e.g., IMDB) that lists Daniel Craig's movies along with their IMDB ratings.\n\n- **Filter movies by runtime**:\n  - Use WebSurfer to check the runtime of each movie listed.\n\n- **Check Netflix (US) availability**:\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for the current availability of each movie on Netflix (US). This can be done by navigating to Netflix’s website or using a third-party site that tracks Netflix availability.\n\n- **Determine the highest-rated movie that meets all criteria**:\n  - Compile the information gathered and identify the movie with the highest IMDB rating that is less than 150 minutes and available on Netflix (US).\n\n- **Verify and provide the final answer**:\n  - Double-check the information to ensure accuracy and provide the final answer."}

His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as Bond.He was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II at the 2022 Queen's New Years Honours for his services to Film and Theatre.Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy\n21 wins & 83 nominations totalPhotos\n901\n+ 895\nKnown for\nNo Time to Die\n7.3\nJames Bond2021Casino Royale\n8.0\nJames Bond2006Skyfall\n7.8\nJames Bond2012Spectre\n6.8\nJames Bond2015Credits\nEdit\nMore to explore\nPhotos\nHollywood Power Couples\nSee the gallery\nEditorial lists\nRelated lists created by IMDb editors\nIMDb staff picks: The best movies & series of 2022\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n56 images\nWeekend box office: Nov. 24 to Nov. 27\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n10 images\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific IMDB ratings for Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The current availability of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which of Daniel Craig's movies meet all the criteria: high IMDB rating, less than 150 minutes, and available on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the IMDB page, \"No Time to Die\" has an IMDB rating of 7.3, \"Skyfall\" has an IMDB rating of 7.8, and \"Logan Lucky\" has an IMDB rating of 7.0. These are some of the highest-rated movies featuring Daniel Craig.\n   - \"No Time to Die\" has a runtime of 163 minutes, so it does not meet the runtime requirement.\n   - \"Skyfall\" has a runtime of 143 minutes, so it meets the runtime requirement but needs to be checked for Netflix (US) availability.\n   - \"Logan Lucky\" has a runtime of 119 minutes, so it meets the runtime requirement but needs to be checked for Netflix (US) availability.\n   - \"Knives Out\" has an IMDB rating of 7.9 and a runtime of 130 minutes, making it a strong candidate. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be confirmed.\n   - \"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\" has an IMDB rating of 7.1 and a runtime of 152 minutes, so it does not meet the runtime requirement.\n   - \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" has an IMDB rating of 7.8 and a runtime of 158 minutes, so it does not meet the runtime requirement.\n   - \"The Adventures of Tintin\" has an IMDB rating of 7.3 and a runtime of 107 minutes, making it a potential candidate. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be confirmed.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n1. **Extract Detailed Information**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to extract the full list of Daniel Craig's movies, including their IMDB ratings and runtimes from the IMDB page.\n   \n2. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - Filter the list to include only movies with a runtime of less than 150 minutes.\n\n3. **Check Netflix (US) Availability**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to check the current availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **Determine the Highest-Rated Movie**:\n   - Identify the movie with the highest IMDB rating that meets all the criteria.\n\n5. **Verify and Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Double-check the information to ensure accuracy and provide the final answer.\n\nPlease proceed to extract the full list of Daniel Craig's movies, including their IMDB ratings and runtimes.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Incomplete Data Extraction**: The previous attempts to scroll and extract data from the IMDB page did not consistently capture the full list of Daniel Craig's movies, their ratings, and runtimes.\n- **Lack of Structured Data Collection**: The data collected was not organized in a structured format, making it difficult to filter and verify the required information.\n- **Manual Scrolling Inefficiency**: Manually scrolling through the page multiple times was inefficient and prone to missing important details.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Automate Data Extraction**:\n   - **Use WebSurfer to Navigate and Extract Data**:\n     - Open the IMDB page for Daniel Craig.\n     - Scroll down the page automatically to ensure all movies are loaded.\n     - Extract the list of movies, including their titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes.\n\n2. **Organize Data**:\n   - **Store Extracted Data in a Structured Format**:\n     - Use a Python script to store the extracted data in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the movie title, IMDB rating, and runtime.\n\n3. **Filter Movies**:\n   - **Apply Filters to the Data**:\n     - Filter the list to include only movies with a runtime of less than 150 minutes.\n\n4. **Check Netflix (US) Availability**:\n   - **Use WebSurfer to Check Availability**:\n     - For each filtered movie, use WebSurfer to check if it is available on Netflix (US).\n\n5. **Determine the Highest-Rated Movie**:\n   - **Identify the Highest-Rated Movie**:\n     - From the filtered and available movies, identify the one with the highest IMDB rating.\n\n6. **Verify and Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - **Double-Check the Information**:\n     - Ensure the final answer is accurate by verifying the IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Open and Scroll IMDB Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the IMDB page for Daniel Craig.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down the page automatically until all movies are loaded.\n\n2. **Extract Movie Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of movies, including titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes.\n   - **Python Script**: Store the extracted data in a list of dictionaries.\n\n3. **Filter Movies by Runtime**:\n   - **Python Script**: Filter the list to include only movies with a runtime of less than 150 minutes.\n\n4. **Check Netflix (US) Availability**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each filtered movie, check if it is available on Netflix (US).\n\n5. **Determine the Highest-Rated Movie**:\n   - **Python Script**: Identify the movie with the highest IMDB rating from the filtered and available movies.\n\n6. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - **Python Script**: Print the final answer, including the movie title, IMDB rating, and runtime.\n\n### Python Script for Data Extraction and Filtering:\n```python\n# Sample Python script to process the extracted data\nmovies = [\n    {\"title\": \"No Time to Die\", \"rating\": 7.3, \"runtime\": 163},\n    {\"title\": \"Skyfall\", \"rating\": 7.8, \"runtime\": 143},\n    {\"title\": \"Logan Lucky\", \"rating\": 7.0, \"runtime\": 119},\n    {\"title\": \"Knives Out\", \"rating\": 7.9, \"runtime\": 130},\n    {\"title\": \"The Adventures of Tintin\", \"rating\": 7.3, \"runtime\": 107}\n]\n\n# Filter movies by runtime\nfiltered_movies = [movie for movie in movies if movie[\"runtime\"] < 150]\n\n# Check Netflix (US) availability (this step will be done by WebSurfer)\n# For demonstration, assume all filtered movies are available on Netflix (US)\navailable_movies = filtered_movies\n\n# Determine the highest-rated movie\nhighest_rated_movie = max(available_movies, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(f\"The highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US) is '{highest_rated_movie['title']}' with a rating of {highest_rated_movie['rating']} and a runtime of {highest_rated_movie['runtime']} minutes.\")\n```\n\n### WebSurfer Commands:\n1. **Open IMDB Page**:\n   - `WebSurfer.open(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/\")`\n2. **Scroll Down Automatically**:\n   - `WebSurfer.scroll_to_bottom()`\n3. **Extract Movie Data**:\n   - `WebSurfer.extract_movie_data()`\n4. **Check Netflix (US) Availability**:\n   - `WebSurfer.check_netflix_availability(movie_title)`\n\n### Example WebSurfer Functions:\n```python\ndef extract_movie_data():\n    # Extract movie data from the IMDB page\n    # Return a list of dictionaries containing movie title, rating, and runtime\n    pass\n\ndef check_netflix_availability(movie_title):\n    # Check if the movie is available on Netflix (US)\n    # Return True if available, False otherwise\n    pass\n```\n\nBy automating the data extraction and organizing the data in a structured format, we can efficiently filter and verify the required information to find the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie that meets all the criteria."}

His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \"Ring O'Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig has English, as well as Irish, Scottish and Welsh, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother.

His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as Bond.He was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II at the 2022 Queen's New Years Honours for his services to Film and Theatre.Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy\n21 wins & 83 nominations totalPhotos\n901\n+ 895\nKnown for\nNo Time to Die\n7.3\nJames Bond2021Casino Royale\n8.0\nJames Bond2006Skyfall\n7.8\nJames Bond2012Spectre\n6.8\nJames Bond2015More to explore\nList\nIMDb Summer Watch Guide\nBrowse the guide\nEditorial lists\nRelated lists created by IMDb editors\nIMDb staff picks: The best movies & series of 2022\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n56 images\nWeekend box office: Nov. 24 to Nov. 27\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n10 images\nTop 100 Stars of 2021\nupdated 3 years ago\n•\n100 people\nThe Most Anticipated Movies of 2020\nupdated 4 years ago\n•\n10 images\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific IMDB ratings for Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The current availability of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which of Daniel Craig's movies meet all the criteria: high IMDB rating, less than 150 minutes, and available on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the IMDB page, \"No Time to Die\" has an IMDB rating of 7.3, \"Skyfall\" has an IMDB rating of 7.8, and \"Logan Lucky\" has an IMDB rating of 7.0. These are some of the highest-rated movies featuring Daniel Craig.\n   - \"No Time to Die\" has a runtime of 163 minutes, so it does not meet the runtime requirement.\n   - \"Skyfall\" has a runtime of 143 minutes, so it meets the runtime requirement but needs to be checked for Netflix (US) availability.\n   - \"Logan Lucky\" has a runtime of 119 minutes, so it meets the runtime requirement but needs to be checked for Netflix (US) availability.\n   - \"Knives Out\" has an IMDB rating of 7.9 and a runtime of 130 minutes, making it a strong candidate. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be confirmed.\n   - \"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\" has an IMDB rating of 7.1 and a runtime of 152 minutes, so it does not meet the runtime requirement.\n   - \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" has an IMDB rating of 7.8 and a runtime of 158 minutes, so it does not meet the runtime requirement.\n   - \"The Adventures of Tintin\" has an IMDB rating of 7.3 and a runtime of 107 minutes, making it a potential candidate. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be confirmed.\n   - \"Dream House\" has an IMDB rating of 6.0 and a runtime of 112 minutes, making it a potential candidate. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be confirmed.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n1. **Extract Detailed Information**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to extract the full list of Daniel Craig's movies, including their IMDB ratings and runtimes from the IMDB page.\n\n2. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - Filter the list to include only movies with a runtime of less than 150 minutes.\n\n3. **Check Netflix (US) Availability**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to check the current availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **Determine the Highest-Rated Movie**:\n   - Identify the movie with the highest IMDB rating that meets all the criteria.\n\n5. **Verify and Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Double-check the information to ensure accuracy and provide the final answer.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Open and Scroll IMDB Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the IMDB page for Daniel Craig.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down the page automatically until all movies are loaded.\n\n2. **Extract Movie Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of movies, including titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes.\n   -

His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \"Ring O'Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig has English, as well as Irish, Scottish and Welsh, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as Bond.He was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II at the 2022 Queen's New Years Honours for his services to Film and Theatre.Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy\n21 wins & 83 nominations totalPhotos\n901\n+ 895\nKnown for\nNo Time to Die\n7.3\nJames Bond2021Casino Royale\n8.0\nJames Bond2006Skyfall\n7.8\nJames Bond2012Spectre\n6.8\nJames Bond2015More to explore\nList\nIMDb Summer Watch Guide\nBrowse the guide\nEditorial lists\nRelated lists created by IMDb editors\nIMDb staff picks: The best movies & series of 2022\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n56 images\nWeekend box office: Nov. 24 to Nov. 27\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n10 images\nTop 100 Stars of 2021\nupdated 3 years ago\n•\n100 people\nThe Most Anticipated Movies of 2020\nupdated 4 years ago\n•\n10 images\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/\",\n        \"name\": \"Daniel Craig\",\n        \"image\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMjk4NDU4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMyNjQzMg@@._V1_.jpg\",\n        \"description\": \"Daniel Craig.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific IMDB ratings for Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The current availability of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which of Daniel Craig's movies meet all the criteria: high IMDB rating, less than 150 minutes, and available on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the IMDB page, \"No Time to Die\" has an IMDB rating of 7.3, \"Skyfall\" has an IMDB rating of 7.8, and \"Logan Lucky\" has an IMDB rating of 7.0. These are some of the highest-rated movies featuring Daniel Craig.\n   - \"No Time to Die\" has a runtime of 163 minutes, so it does not meet the runtime requirement.\n   - \"Skyfall\" has a runtime of 143 minutes, so it meets the runtime requirement but needs to be checked for Netflix (US) availability.\n   - \"Logan Lucky\" has a runtime of 119 minutes, so it meets the runtime requirement but needs to be checked for Netflix (US) availability.\n   - \"Knives Out\" has an IMDB rating of 7.9 and a runtime of 130 minutes, making it a strong candidate. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be confirmed.\n   - \"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\" has an IMDB rating of 7.1 and a runtime of 152 minutes, so it does not meet the runtime requirement.\n   - \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" has an IMDB rating of 7.8 and a runtime of 158 minutes, so it does not meet the runtime requirement.\n   - \"The Adventures of Tintin\" has an IMDB rating of 7.3 and a runtime of 107 minutes, making it a potential candidate. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be confirmed.\n   - \"Dream House\" has an IMDB rating of 6.0 and a runtime of 112 minutes, making it a potential candidate. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be confirmed.\n   - \"Casino Royale\" has an IMDB rating of 8.0 and a runtime of 144 minutes, making it a strong candidate. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be confirmed.\n   - \"Quantum of Solace\" has an IMDB rating of 6.9 and a runtime of 110 minutes, making it a potential candidate. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be confirmed.\n   - \"Spectre\" has an IMDB rating of 6.8 and a runtime of 148 minutes, making it a potential candidate. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be confirmed.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n1. **Extract Detailed Information**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to extract the full list of Daniel Craig's movies, including their IMDB ratings and runtimes from the IMDB page.\n\n2. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - Filter the list to include only movies with a runtime of less than 150 minutes.\n\n3. **Check Netflix (US) Availability**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to check the current availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **Determine the Highest-Rated Movie**:\n   - Identify the movie with the highest IMDB rating that meets all the criteria.\n\n5. **Verify and Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Double-check the information to ensure accuracy and provide the final answer.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Open and Scroll IMDB Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the IMDB page for Daniel Craig.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down the page automatically until all movies are loaded.\n\n2. **Extract Movie Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of movies, including titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes.\n   - **Python Script**: Store the extracted data in a list of dictionaries.\n\n3. **Filter Movies by Runtime**:\n   - **Python Script**: Filter the list to include only movies with a runtime of less than 150 minutes.\n\n4. **Check Netflix (US) Availability**:\n   -

His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \"Ring O'Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig has English, as well as Irish, Scottish and Welsh, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964.
