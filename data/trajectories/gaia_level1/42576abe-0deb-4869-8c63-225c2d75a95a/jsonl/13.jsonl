I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sentence structure in Tizin is Verb-Object-Subject.\n   - The word for oneself in the nominative form is \"Pa\".\n   - The word for oneself in the accusative form is \"Mato\".\n   - The word for oneself in the genitive form is \"Sing\".\n   - The root verb for an intense like for something is \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Maktay\" is used in its root form in the present tense.\n   - \"Maktay\" is \"Tay\" in the preterit past.\n   - \"Maktay\" is \"Aktay\" in the imperfect past.\n   - \"Maktay\" translates better as \"is pleasing to\", where the thing doing the liking is the object.\n   - The word for apples in the nominative form is \"Apple\".\n   - The word for apples in the accusative form is \"Zapple\".\n   - The word for apples in the genitive form is \"Izapple\".\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - No specific facts need to be looked up as all necessary information is provided in the request.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The correct form of the verb \"Maktay\" to use in the present tense.\n   - The correct order of words in the sentence \"I like apples\" based on the given sentence structure (Verb-Object-Subject).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Since \"Maktay\" is used in its root form in the present tense, and the sentence structure is Verb-Object-Subject, the translation of \"I like apples\" would involve using \"Maktay\" followed by \"Zapple\" (the accusative form of \"apples\") and then \"Pa\" (the nominative form of \"I\").\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Confirm the sentence structure and verb forms from the given information.\n- Construct the Tizin sentence \"I like apples\" using the provided grammar rules.\n- Verify the constructed sentence against the given rules to ensure accuracy.\n- Provide the final translation to the user.\n\nGiven the straightforward nature of the task and the completeness of the provided information, there is no need to involve the ComputerTerminal, FileSurfer, or WebSurfer. The Assistant can handle the translation directly."}
