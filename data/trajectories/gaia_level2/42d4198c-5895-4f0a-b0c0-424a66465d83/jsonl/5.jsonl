Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - We need to find the Wikipedia page for this game.\n   - We need to count the number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the month listed as the game's release date.\n   - The release date is as of the most recent entry from 2022.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards.\n   - The release date of the game, as listed on its Wikipedia page.\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the month of the game's release date.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the specified month can be derived by examining the revision history of the page.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The 2019 British Academy Games Award winner is likely a well-known and critically acclaimed game.\n   - The release date of the game is probably listed clearly on its Wikipedia page.\n   - The number of revisions before the release date could be substantial, given the popularity and anticipation of major video game releases.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the 2019 British Academy Games Award Winner**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for the 2019 British Academy Games Award winner.\n  - Note the name of the winning game.\n\n- **Find the Release Date of the Game**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page of the identified game.\n  - Locate and note the release date of the game as listed on the Wikipedia page.\n\n- **Count the Number of Revisions Before the Release Date**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the revision history of the Wikipedia page.\n  - Use the browser's search function to find the revisions made before the month of the release date.\n  - Count the number of revisions before the specified month.\n\n- **Report the Results**\n  - Compile the findings and report the number of revisions before the release date."}

The game was released worldwide for the \nPlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a \nWindows port released in January 2022. It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are basically 2 protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and \ngods of the Norse world.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"God of War (2018 video game)\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2016-06-14T19:06:41Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-16T13:09:35Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"headline\": \"2018 action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by Santa Monica Studio\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"853\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"God of War (2018 video game) - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
