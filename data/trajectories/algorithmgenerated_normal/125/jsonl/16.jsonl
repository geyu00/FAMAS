{"agent": "NYC_Local_Expert", "content": "Let's start by identifying the exact location of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) so we can calculate the five-minute walking distance. The address of the NYSE is 11 Wall St, New York, NY 10005.\n\nNext, I will look for martial arts schools that are within a five-minute walk from this location. Considering an approximate walking radius of about 0.25 miles, I will search for nearby martial arts studios.\n\nI will then gather information regarding their schedules for classes that run between 7-9 pm. \n\nLet's execute the first step to gather martial arts schools around the NYSE. I will verify their distance from the NYSE. I’ll provide an initial list of martial arts schools and their details shortly."}
