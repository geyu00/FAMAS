As such, it was probably similar to the \nFingallian dialect of the \nFingal area. Both became functionally extinct in the 19th century when they were replaced by modern \nHiberno-English. The word \nyola means \n'old' in the dialect.\n[6] In modern times, there have been efforts to \nrevive the dialect. \nHistory[edit]Main article: \nHistory of the English languageOrigins[edit]Further information: \nHistory of the English language, \nWest Saxon dialect, \nWest Country English, and \nKildare PoemsThe dialect was spoken in \nCounty Wexford, particularly in the \nbaronies of \nForth and \nBargy. This was the first area English speakers came to in the \nNorman invasion of Ireland, supporting the theory that it evolved from the \nMiddle English introduced in that period. As such it is thought to have been similar to \nFingallian, which was spoken in the \nFingal region north of \nDublin. Middle English, the mother tongue of the \"\nOld English\" community, was widespread throughout southeastern Ireland until the 14th century; as the Old English were increasingly assimilated into Irish culture, their original language was gradually displaced through \nGaelicisation. After this point, Yola and Fingallian were the only attested \nrelicts of this original form of English.\n[7][8]Modern English was widely introduced by British colonists during and after the 17th century, forming the basis for the modern \nHiberno-English of Ireland. The new varieties were notably distinct from the surviving relict dialects.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Yola dialect\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yola_dialect\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q56395\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q56395\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2004-09-02T08:14:22Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-06-17T23:43:41Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Forth-Bargy.gif\",\n        \"headline\": \"extinct Germanic language\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Forth-Bargy.gif\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"664\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Yola dialect - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
