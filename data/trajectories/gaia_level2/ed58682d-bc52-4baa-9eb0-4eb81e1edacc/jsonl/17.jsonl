Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The artist in question is the \"King of Pop,\" which refers to Michael Jackson.\n   - We are looking for the last word before the second chorus.\n   - The song is the fifth single from Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.\n   - The track listing of the sixth studio album to identify the fifth single.\n   - The lyrics of the identified song to find the last word before the second chorus.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n     - Michael Jackson's official discography on his website or reputable music databases like AllMusic, Discogs, or Wikipedia.\n     - Lyrics can be found on official lyric sites like Genius or Musixmatch.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify the structure of the song to locate the second chorus.\n   - Determine the exact placement of the second chorus within the song's lyrics.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The sixth studio album is likely \"Bad\" (1987), as it is one of Michael Jackson's most famous albums.\n   - The fifth single from \"Bad\" is probably \"Smooth Criminal,\" but this needs verification.\n   - The last word before the second chorus in \"Smooth Criminal\" might be \"move,\" but this is just a guess and needs to be confirmed with the actual lyrics.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Sixth Studio Album:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Search for Michael Jackson's discography to confirm the name of his sixth studio album.\n  \n- **Identify the Fifth Single:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Once the album is confirmed, search for the track listing to identify the fifth single from that album.\n  \n- **Find the Lyrics:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Search for the lyrics of the identified song.\n  \n- **Locate the Second Chorus:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Analyze the lyrics to locate the second chorus and identify the last word before it.\n  \n- **Verify and Report:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Double-check the findings to ensure accuracy and report the last word before the second chorus."}

One of the \nbest-selling artists of all time, Michael Jackson has sold over 500 million records worldwide.\n[1] In the United States, Jackson amassed 13 \nBillboard Hot 100 number-one singles (more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single in the \nBillboard Hot 100 in five different decades.\n[2] In 2012, Jackson was ranked the fifth \nbest selling singles artist in the United Kingdom with 15.3 million singles sold.\n[3]Jackson's first solo entry on the US \nBillboard Hot 100 songs chart was \"\nGot to Be There\", which peaked at number four in 1971.\n[4] Jackson's first number-one hit on the chart was \"\nBen\", in 1972.\n[5] Jackson continued to release singles throughout the 1970s. The album \nOff the Wall (1979) contained five singles, including the chart-topping \"\nDon't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" and \"\nRock with You\".\n[5] Both are certified multi-Platinum by the \nRecording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States for sales in excess of 6 million copies.\n[6] With the following singles \n\"Off the Wall\" and \"\nShe's Out of My Life\" also reaching the US top 10, Jackson became the first solo artist to have four singles from the same album reach the top 10 of the \nBillboard Hot 100.\n[7]In 1982, Jackson released his sixth studio album, \nThriller. \"\nThe Girl Is Mine\", a collaboration with \nPaul McCartney, was released as the first single from the album. The single peaked at number two on the \nBillboard Hot 100.\n[8] \"\nBillie Jean\" was the album's second single. The single topped the charts in 13 countries, including the United States.\n[9] The single sold more than 10 million copies in the United States\n[10] and over 1.4 million in the United Kingdom.\n[11] \"\nBeat It\", released a month later, peaked at number one in nine countries and sold more than eight million copies in the US.\n[6] \"\nThriller\" was released in November 1983 and peaked at number four on the \nBillboard Hot 100. The single sold 10 million copies in the US alone, making it Jackson's best-selling single.\n[6] In 1983, Jackson again collaborated with McCartney and \"\nSay Say Say\" was released as the first single from McCartney's 1983 album \nPipes of Peace. It was a number-one hit in the United States.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Michael Jackson singles discography\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson_singles_discography\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q517864\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q517864\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2005-10-28T22:02:37Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-07T16:49:28Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/George_H._W._Bush_with_Michael_Jackson_%28cropped%29.png\",\n        \"headline\": \"Wikimedia singles discography\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.8\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/George_H._W._Bush_with_Michael_Jackson_%28cropped%29.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"938\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Michael Jackson singles discography - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

It was a number-one hit in the United States.\n[12] Jackson's seventh studio album, \nBad (1987), produced nine singles with seven charting in the United States. Five of these singles (\"\nI Just Can't Stop Loving You\", \"\nBad\", \"\nThe Way You Make Me Feel\", \"\nMan in the Mirror\", and \"\nDirty Diana\") reached number one on the \nBillboard Hot 100, a record for most number-one Hot 100 singles from any one album.\n[13][14]In 1991, Jackson released his eighth studio album, \nDangerous, co-produced with \nTeddy Riley. The album produced four top-ten singles on the \nBillboard Hot 100: \"\nRemember the Time\", \"\nIn the Closet\", \"\nWill You Be There\" (produced and performed by Jackson as the theme for the film \nFree Willy) and the number-one hit \"\nBlack or White\".\n[15] In June 1995, Jackson released his ninth album, \nHIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, a double album. The first disc, \nHIStory Begins, is a 15-track greatest hits album. The second disc, \nHIStory Continues, contains 13 original songs and two cover versions.\n[16] The album features \"\nScream\", a duet with Jackson's youngest sister \nJanet; \"\nEarth Song\"; \"\nThey Don't Care About Us\"; and \"\nYou Are Not Alone\".\n[17] \"You Are Not Alone\" holds the \nGuinness World Record for the first song ever to debut at number one on the \nBillboard Hot 100 chart.\n[18][19] \"Earth Song\" was the third single released from \nHIStory, and it topped the UK Singles Chart for six weeks over Christmas 1995 and sold over 1.2 million copies, making it one of Jackson's most successful singles in the UK.\n[20] Jackson worked with collaborators including Teddy Riley and \nRodney Jerkins to produce his tenth solo album, \nInvincible (2001). \nInvincible spawned three singles: \"\nYou Rock My World\", \"\nCry\", and \"\nButterflies\".\n[21] Following \nJackson's death in 2009, sales of his previous work soared and Jackson became the first act to sell more than 1 million song downloads in a week, with 2.6 million downloads.\n[22] Following the surge in sales, in March 2010, \nSony Music signed a $250 million deal with the \nJackson estate to extend their distribution rights to Jackson's back catalog until at least 2017.\n[23] As part of this deal, two posthumous albums of previously unreleased tracks were released: \nMichael (2010) and \nXscape (2014).\n[24] In 2017, Sony renewed its deal for $250 million, which went into effect in January 2018.\n[25]As lead artist[edit]List of singles as lead artist, with chart positions, sales and certifications, showing year released and album name \nTitle \nYear \nPeak chart positions \nSales \nCertifications \nAlbum \nUS[26]AUS[27]CAN[28]FRA[a][29]GER[30]NL[31]NZ[32]SPN[33]SWI[34]UK[35]\"\nGot to Be There\" \n1971 \n4 \n83 \n3 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n5 \nUS: 1,600,000\n[36]WW: 4,000,000\n[37]\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
