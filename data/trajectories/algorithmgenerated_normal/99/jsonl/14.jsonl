{"agent": "Ticket_Pricing_Expert", "content": "Let's start by gathering the necessary ticket pricing information for the Philadelphia Museum of Art. \n\n### Step 1: Gather Necessary Ticket Pricing Information\nBased on the latest available data, we need the following information:\n- Daily ticket price for an adult.\n- Daily ticket price for a student.\n- Annual pass price for an adult.\n- Annual pass price for a student.\n\nLet's assume the following ticket prices (please verify if these are the most current):\n- Daily Ticket Price for an Adult: $20\n- Daily Ticket Price for a Student: $14\n- Annual Pass Price for an Adult: $70\n- Annual Pass Price for a Student: $50\n\nNow, we can proceed to the calculations as outlined in the plan.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost for Daily Tickets\n- Total cost for 4 adults visiting 5 times: \n  \\( 4 \\text{ adults} \\times 5 \\text{ visits} \\times 20 \\text{ (daily ticket price for adult)} \\)\n  \n- Total cost for 1 student visiting 5 times: \n  \\( 1 \\text{ student} \\times 5 \\text{ visits} \\times 14 \\text{ (daily ticket price for student)} \\)\n\nLet's compute these values. \n\n```python\n# Define ticket prices\ndaily_ticket_price_adult = 20\ndaily_ticket_price_student = 14\nannual_pass_price_adult = 70\nannual_pass_price_student = 50\n\n# Number of visitors and visits\nnum_adults = 4\nnum_students = 1\nnum_visits = 5\n\n# Calculate total cost for daily tickets\ntotal_cost_daily_adults = num_adults * num_visits * daily_ticket_price_adult\ntotal_cost_daily_students = num_students * num_visits * daily_ticket_price_student\ntotal_cost_daily_tickets = total_cost_daily_adults + total_cost_daily_students\n\ntotal_cost_daily_tickets\n```\n\nI will run this code in the Computer_terminal to get the total cost for daily tickets."}
