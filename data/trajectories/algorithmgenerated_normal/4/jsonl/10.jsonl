{"agent": "HawaiiRealEstate_Expert", "content": "Let's begin by gathering the recent sales data for the two specified homes: 2072 Akaikai Loop and 2017 Komo Mai Drive in Pearl City, Hawaii. \n\nI'll need to fetch the sales data for these addresses to determine which one sold for more in 2022. I'll start by running a data query to extract the relevant information. \n\nFor now, I'll assume I have access to a function that can provide sales data. Let me prepare the query for extracting the sales data for these two homes. \n\nHere's the information I will look for:\n\n1. Sales price for 2072 Akaikai Loop, Pearl City, Hawaii, in 2022.\n2. Sales price for 2017 Komo Mai Drive, Pearl City, Hawaii, in 2022.\n\nLet's proceed with a hypothetical example of how the data retrieval might look in code. \n\nI'll run a mock query to simulate this data extraction. \n\n```python\n# Mock code to simulate data extraction for sales data of the two properties\nsales_data = {\n    \"2072 Akaikai Loop\": 850000,  # Hypothetical value for simulation\n    \"2017 Komo Mai Drive\": 900000  # Hypothetical value for simulation\n}\n\n# Extracting sale prices\nakaikai_price = sales_data[\"2072 Akaikai Loop\"]\nkomo_mai_price = sales_data[\"2017 Komo Mai Drive\"]\n\n# Determining which home sold for more\nif akaikai_price > komo_mai_price:\n    result_address = \"2072 Akaikai Loop\"\n    result_price = akaikai_price\nelse:\n    result_address = \"2017 Komo Mai Drive\"\n    result_price = komo_mai_price\n\nprint(result_address, result_price)\n```\n\nNow, I'll execute the equivalent operation to fetch real data instead of using mock values. \n\nPlease hold on while I collect the actual sales data."}
