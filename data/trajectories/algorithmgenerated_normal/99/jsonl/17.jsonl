Hereâ€™s an example of what the prices might be:\n\n- Daily ticket price for an adult: $25\n- Daily ticket price for a student: $15\n- Annual pass price for an adult: $70\n- Annual pass price for a student: $50\n\nNow I will move on to calculate the total costs for daily tickets and annual passes based on this pricing information.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for daily tickets\n- Total cost for 4 adults visiting 5 times:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost for Adults} = 4 \\, \\text{adults} \\times 5 \\, \\text{visits} \\times 25 \\, \\text{dollars}\n  \\]\n- Total cost for 1 student visiting 5 times:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost for Student} = 1 \\, \\text{student} \\times 5 \\, \\text{visits} \\times 15 \\, \\text{dollars}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for annual passes\n- Total cost for 4 adults with annual passes:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost for Adults} = 4 \\, \\text{adults} \\times 70 \\, \\text{dollars}\n  \\]\n- Total cost for 1 student with an annual pass:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost for Student} = 1 \\, \\text{student} \\times 50 \\, \\text{dollars}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate and determine the savings\nI will now perform the calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy. \n\n```python\n# Pricing Information\ndaily_ticket_price_adult = 25  # dollars\ndaily_ticket_price_student = 15  # dollars\nannual_pass_price_adult = 70     # dollars\nannual_pass_price_student = 50    # dollars\n\n# Total cost for daily tickets\nadults_count = 4\nstudent_count = 1\nvisits_count = 5\n\ntotal_daily_cost_adults = adults_count * visits_count * daily_ticket_price_adult\ntotal_daily_cost_student = student_count * visits_count * daily_ticket_price_student\ntotal_daily_cost = total_daily_cost_adults + total_daily_cost_student\n\n# Total cost for annual passes\ntotal_annual_cost_adults = adults_count * annual_pass_price_adult\ntotal_annual_cost_student = student_count * annual_pass_price_student\ntotal_annual_cost = total_annual_cost_adults + total_annual_cost_student\n\n# Calculate savings\nsavings = total_daily_cost - total_annual_cost\n\n# Output results\n(total_daily_cost, total_annual_cost, savings)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code."}
