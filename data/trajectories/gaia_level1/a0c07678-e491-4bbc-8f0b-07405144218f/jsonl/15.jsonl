Give them to me in the form Pitcher Before, Pitcher After, use their last names only, in Roman characters.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking for pitchers with numbers before and after Taishō Tamai's number as of July 2023.\n   - The names should be provided in the form: Pitcher Before, Pitcher After.\n   - The names should be given in Roman characters and only the last names should be used.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Taishō Tamai's jersey number as of July 2023.\n   - The jersey numbers of the pitchers immediately before and after Taishō Tamai's number.\n   - The last names of these pitchers in Roman characters.\n   - These facts can be found on official team websites, sports news sites, or databases like Baseball-Reference.com.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Once the jersey numbers are known, the pitchers' names can be identified and their last names extracted.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Taishō Tamai likely plays for a professional baseball team in Japan, such as the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league.\n   - The pitchers' numbers are likely to be consecutive, but this needs verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for Taishō Tamai's jersey number as of July 2023.\n- **Step 2:** Once the number is confirmed, use WebSurfer to find the jersey numbers of the pitchers immediately before and after Taishō Tamai's number.\n- **Step 3:** Identify the last names of these pitchers and ensure they are in Roman characters.\n- **Step 4:** Format the final answer as requested: Pitcher Before, Pitcher After."}
