{"agent": "YouTubeDownload_Expert", "content": "It seems there was an issue with downloading the video. The error indicates that there's a problem with precondition checks, possibly related to needing to sign in to YouTube to confirm access to the video.\n\n### Steps to resolve the issue:\n1. **Upgrade Python**: First, we need to upgrade Python to version 3.8 or above because `yt-dlp` support for Python 3.7 has been deprecated.\n2. **Download the Video with Cookie Authentication**: If the video requires login, we can use cookies to bypass the sign-in verification.\n\nFor now, let's focus on upgrading Python. After that, I'll provide a method to download the video using cookie authentication.\n\nPlease confirm if you would like to proceed with upgrading Python, or if you have a different approach in mind."}
