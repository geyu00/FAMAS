After that, we can manually check the availability of each of these films on Netflix (US).\n\nHere are some notable Daniel Craig films:\n\n1. **Casino Royale (2006)**\n   - Duration: 144 minutes\n   - IMDB Rating: 8.0\n\n2. **Layer Cake (2004)**\n   - Duration: 105 minutes\n   - IMDB Rating: 7.3\n\n3. **Skyfall (2012)**\n   - Duration: 143 minutes\n   - IMDB Rating: 7.8\n\n4. **Spectre (2015)**\n   - Duration: 148 minutes\n   - IMDB Rating: 6.8\n\n5. **Knives Out (2019)**\n   - Duration: 130 minutes\n   - IMDB Rating: 7.9\n\n6. **The Invasion (2007)**\n   - Duration: 98 minutes\n   - IMDB Rating: 5.9\n\nNow, based on the data above, the films under 150 minutes are:\n- **Casino Royale (2006)** - 144 minutes - IMDB 8.0\n- **Layer Cake (2004)** - 105 minutes - IMDB 7.3\n- **Skyfall (2012)** - 143 minutes - IMDB 7.8\n- **Knives Out (2019)** - 130 minutes - IMDB 7.9\n- **The Invasion (2007)** - 98 minutes - IMDB 5.9\n\nNext, we should manually check the availability of \"Casino Royale,\" \"Skyfall,\" \"Knives Out,\" and \"Layer Cake\" on Netflix (US) to identify the highest-rated movie among these.
