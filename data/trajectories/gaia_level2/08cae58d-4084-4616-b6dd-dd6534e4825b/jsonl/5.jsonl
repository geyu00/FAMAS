{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question asks about the first year the Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The source for this information is specified as Google Finance.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) to determine the first year it went above $50.\n   - This information can be found on Google Finance by looking at the historical price chart or using a search function for specific price points.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required beyond identifying the year from the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone several splits, so the $50 threshold would need to be considered before any splits.\n   - Given that Apple's stock has been highly volatile and has seen significant growth over the years, it is likely that this event occurred in the early to mid-2000s. However, this is an educated guess and needs verification from the actual data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the source**: Use Google Finance to find the historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL).\n- **Search for the specific year**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to Google Finance and search for the historical price data of Apple stock.\n- **Locate the first instance**: Identify the first year when the stock price went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n- **Verify the result**: Double-check the identified year to ensure accuracy.\n- **Report the findings**: Provide the year when the stock first went above $50."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question asks about the first year the Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The source for this information is specified as Google Finance.\n   - We have accessed the historical price chart for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance, but have not yet located the specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) to determine the first year it went above $50.\n   - This information can be found on Google Finance by examining the historical price chart or using a search function for specific price points.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required beyond identifying the year from the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone several splits, so the $50 threshold would need to be considered before any splits. For example, Apple's stock split 7-for-1 in June 2014, which means that the pre-split price equivalent would be higher.\n   - Given that Apple's stock has been highly volatile and has seen significant growth over the years, it is likely that this event occurred in the early to mid-2000s. However, considering the stock splits, the actual year might be earlier than initially guessed.\n   - Based on the historical context and the significant growth of Apple, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the stock might have first reached $50 (pre-split) in the late 1990s or early 2000s. This period coincides with the resurgence of Apple under Steve Jobs' leadership and the introduction of popular products like the iMac and iPod.\n\n5. **NEXT STEPS**\n   - Continue to scroll through the historical price chart on Google Finance to locate the exact year when the stock price first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - If necessary, use the search function on Google Finance to find the specific date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step to locate the exact year. Please scroll through the historical price chart and identify the first year when the stock price went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigation and Focus**: The previous attempts involved navigating through the page and scrolling, but did not specifically focus on the historical price chart. This led to missing the relevant data.\n- **Lack of Specific Actions**: The instructions were too general and did not guide the WebSurfer to directly interact with the historical price chart or use specific features like the search function.\n- **Verification**: There was no explicit verification step to ensure that the correct data was being identified and recorded.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Historical Price Chart**:\n   - Open Google Finance and search for \"Apple stock historical prices\".\n   - Click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum historical data available.\n\n2. **Locate the First Year Above $50**:\n   - Scroll through the historical price chart to find the first year when the stock price went above $50.\n   - Use the zoom feature or the timeline slider to focus on the relevant period (late 1990s to early 2000s).\n\n3. **Verify the Data**:\n   - Once the year is identified, verify the stock price by checking the specific date or month within that year.\n   - Ensure that the price is above $50 and not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n4. **Report the Findings**:\n   - Clearly state the year when the stock first went above $50.\n   - Provide any additional context or verification details if necessary.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Historical Price Chart**\n  - Open the Google Finance page for Apple (AAPL).\n  - Search for \"Apple stock historical prices\".\n  - Click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum historical data available.\n\n- **Step 2: Locate the First Year Above $50**\n  - Scroll through the historical price chart.\n  - Use the zoom feature or the timeline slider to focus on the period from the late 1990s to early 2000s.\n  - Identify the first year when the stock price went above $50.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify the Data**\n  - Check the specific date or month within the identified year to ensure the stock price is above $50.\n  - Confirm that the price is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n- **Step 4: Report the Findings**\n  - State the year when the stock first went above $50.\n  - Provide any additional context or verification details.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan and locate the first year when the Apple stock price went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question asks about the first year the Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The source for this information is specified as Google Finance.\n   - We have accessed the historical price chart for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance, but have not yet located the specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) to determine the first year it went above $50.\n   - This information can be found on Google Finance by examining the historical price chart or using a search function for specific price points.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required beyond identifying the year from the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone several splits, so the $50 threshold would need to be considered before any splits. For example, Apple's stock split 7-for-1 in June 2014, which means that the pre-split price equivalent would be higher.\n   - Given that Apple's stock has been highly volatile and has seen significant growth over the years, it is likely that this event occurred in the early to mid-2000s. However, considering the stock splits, the actual year might be earlier than initially guessed.\n   - Based on the historical context and the significant growth of Apple, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the stock might have first reached $50 (pre-split) in the late 1990s or early 2000s. This period coincides with the resurgence of Apple under Steve Jobs' leadership and the introduction of popular products like the iMac and iPod.\n   - **New Educated Guess**: Considering the significant growth and the timing of major product launches, it is plausible that the stock first reached $50 in the year 2000. This period aligns with the release of the iMac and the beginning of Apple's resurgence.\n\n5. **NEXT STEPS**\n   - Continue to scroll through the historical price chart on Google Finance to locate the exact year when the stock price first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - If necessary, use the search function on Google Finance to find the specific date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n### Detailed Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Historical Price Chart**\n   - Open the Google Finance page for Apple (AAPL).\n   - Search for \"Apple stock historical prices\".\n   - Click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum historical data available.\n\n2. **Locate the First Year Above $50**\n   - Scroll through the historical price chart.\n   - Use the zoom feature or the timeline slider to focus on the period from the late 1990s to early 2000s.\n   - Identify the first year when the stock price went above $50.\n\n3. **Verify the Data**\n   - Check the specific date or month within the identified year to ensure the stock price is above $50.\n   - Ensure that the price is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n4. **Report the Findings**\n   - Clearly state the year when the stock first went above $50.\n   - Provide any additional context or verification details if necessary.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan and locate the first year when the Apple stock price went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigation and Focus**: The previous attempts involved navigating through the page and scrolling, but did not specifically focus on the historical price chart. This led to missing the relevant data.\n- **Lack of Specific Actions**: The instructions were too general and did not guide the WebSurfer to directly interact with the historical price chart or use specific features like the search function.\n- **Verification**: There was no explicit verification step to ensure that the correct data was being identified and recorded.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Historical Price Chart**\n   - Open the Google Finance page for Apple (AAPL).\n   - Search for \"Apple stock historical prices\".\n   - Click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum historical data available.\n\n2. **Locate the First Year Above $50**\n   - Scroll through the historical price chart.\n   - Use the zoom feature or the timeline slider to focus on the period from the late 1990s to early 2000s.\n   - Identify the first year when the stock price went above $50.\n\n3. **Verify the Data**\n   - Check the specific date or month within the identified year to ensure the stock price is above $50.\n   - Ensure that the price is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n4. **Report the Findings**\n   - Clearly state the year when the stock first went above $50.\n   - Provide any additional context or verification details if necessary.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Historical Price Chart**\n  - Open the Google Finance page for Apple (AAPL).\n  - Search for \"Apple stock historical prices\".\n  - Click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum historical data available.\n\n- **Step 2: Locate the First Year Above $50**\n  - Scroll through the historical price chart.\n  - Use the zoom feature or the timeline slider to focus on the period from the late 1990s to early 2000s.\n  - Identify the first year when the stock price went above $50.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify the Data**\n  - Check the specific date or month within the identified year to ensure the stock price is above $50.\n  - Ensure that the price is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n- **Step 4: Report the Findings**\n  - Clearly state the year when the stock first went above $50.\n  - Provide any additional context or verification details if necessary.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Focus on the Chart**: Ensure that the WebSurfer focuses on the historical price chart and not other sections of the page.\n- **Use Zoom and Timeline Slider**: Utilize the zoom feature and the timeline slider to narrow down the search to the relevant period.\n- **Verify Data Points**: Double-check the specific dates or months to confirm the stock price is above $50 and not adjusted for stock splits.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan and locate the first year when the Apple stock price went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the latest insights and a refined educated guess:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question asks about the first year the Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The source for this information is specified as Google Finance.\n   - We have accessed the historical price chart for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance, but have not yet located the specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) to determine the first year it went above $50.\n   - This information can be found on Google Finance by examining the historical price chart or using a search function for specific price points.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required beyond identifying the year from the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone several splits, so the $50 threshold would need to be considered before any splits. For example, Apple's stock split 7-for-1 in June 2014, which means that the pre-split price equivalent would be higher.\n   - Given that Apple's stock has been highly volatile and has seen significant growth over the years, it is likely that this event occurred in the early to mid-2000s. However, considering the stock splits, the actual year might be earlier than initially guessed.\n   - Based on the historical context and the significant growth of Apple, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the stock might have first reached $50 (pre-split) in the late 1990s or early 2000s. This period coincides with the resurgence of Apple under Steve Jobs' leadership and the introduction of popular products like the iMac and iPod.\n   - **Updated Educated Guess**: Considering the significant growth and the timing of major product launches, it is plausible that the stock first reached $50 in the year 2000. This period aligns with the release of the iMac and the beginning of Apple's resurgence. However, given the volatility and the impact of the dot-com bubble, it is also possible that the stock first reached $50 in the late 1990s, particularly around 1998 or 1999.\n\n5. **NEXT STEPS**\n   - Continue to scroll through the historical price chart on Google Finance to locate the exact year when the stock price first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - If necessary, use the search function on Google Finance to find the specific date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n### Detailed Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Historical Price Chart**\n   - Open the Google Finance page for Apple (AAPL).\n   - Search for \"Apple stock historical prices\".\n   - Click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum historical data available.\n\n2. **Locate the First Year Above $50**\n   - Scroll through the historical price chart.\n   - Use the zoom feature or the timeline slider to focus on the period from the late 1990s to early 2000s.\n   - Identify the first year when the stock price went above $50.\n\n3. **Verify the Data**\n   - Check the specific date or month within the identified year to ensure the stock price is above $50.\n   - Ensure that the price is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n4. **Report the Findings**\n   - Clearly state the year when the stock first went above $50.\n   - Provide any additional context or verification details if necessary.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Focus on the Chart**: Ensure that the WebSurfer focuses on the historical price chart and not other sections of the page.\n- **Use Zoom and Timeline Slider**: Utilize the zoom feature and the timeline slider to narrow down the search to the relevant period.\n- **Verify Data Points**: Double-check the specific dates or months to confirm the stock price is above $50 and not adjusted for stock splits.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan and locate the first year when the Apple stock price went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigation and Focus**: The WebSurfer did not focus on the historical price chart and instead navigated to other sections of the page, such as news articles and financial statements.\n- **Lack of Specific Actions**: The instructions were too general and did not guide the WebSurfer to directly interact with the historical price chart or use specific features like the zoom function.\n- **Verification**: There was no explicit verification step to ensure that the correct data was being identified and recorded.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Historical Price Chart**\n   - Open the Google Finance page for Apple (AAPL).\n   - Click on the \"Historical prices\" tab.\n   - Click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum historical data available.\n\n2. **Locate the First Year Above $50**\n   - Scroll through the historical price chart.\n   - Use the zoom feature or the timeline slider to focus on the period from the late 1990s to early 2000s.\n   - Identify the first year when the stock price went above $50.\n\n3. **Verify the Data**\n   - Check the specific date or month within the identified year to ensure the stock price is above $50.\n   - Ensure that the price is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n4. **Report the Findings**\n   - Clearly state the year when the stock first went above $50.\n   - Provide any additional context or verification details if necessary.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Historical Price Chart**\n  - Open the Google Finance page for Apple (AAPL).\n  - Click on the \"Historical prices\" tab.\n  - Click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum historical data available.\n\n- **Step 2: Locate the First Year Above $50**\n  - Scroll through the historical price chart.\n  -

Check the specific date or month within the identified year to ensure the stock price is above $50.\n  - Ensure that the price is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n- **Step 4: Report the Findings**\n  - Clearly state the year when the stock first went above $50.\n  - Provide any additional context or verification details if necessary.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Focus on the Chart**: Ensure that the WebSurfer focuses on the historical price chart and not other sections of the page.\n- **Use Zoom and Timeline Slider**: Utilize the zoom feature and the timeline slider to narrow down the search to the relevant period.\n- **Verify Data Points**: Double-check the specific dates or months to confirm the stock price is above $50 and not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n### Instructions for WebSurfer\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Historical Price Chart**\n  - Open the Google Finance page for Apple (AAPL).\n  - Click on the \"Historical prices\" tab.\n  - Click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum historical data available.\n\n- **Step 2: Locate the First Year Above $50**\n  -

By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade.\nWikipediaCEO\nTim CookFounded\nApr 1, 1976\nHeadquarters\nCupertino\n, \nCalifornia\nUnited States\nWebsite\napple.com\nEmployees\n164,000\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the latest insights and a refined educated guess:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question asks about the first year the Apple stock went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The source for this information is specified as Google Finance.\n   - We have accessed the historical price chart for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance, but have not yet located the specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) to determine the first year it went above $50.\n   - This information can be found on Google Finance by examining the historical price chart or using a search function for specific price points.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required beyond identifying the year from the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone several splits, so the $50 threshold would need to be considered before any splits. For example, Apple's stock split 7-for-1 in June 2014, which means that the pre-split price equivalent would be higher.\n   - Given that Apple's stock has been highly volatile and has seen significant growth over the years, it is likely that this event occurred in the early to mid-2000s. However, considering the stock splits, the actual year might be earlier than initially guessed.\n   - Based on the historical context and the significant growth of Apple, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the stock might have first reached $50 (pre-split) in the late 1990s or early 2000s. This period coincides with the resurgence of Apple under Steve Jobs' leadership and the introduction of popular products like the iMac and iPod.\n   - **Updated Educated Guess**: Considering the significant growth and the timing of major product launches, it is plausible that the stock first reached $50 in the year 2000. This period aligns with the release of the iMac and the beginning of Apple's resurgence. However, given the volatility and the impact of the dot-com bubble, it is also possible that the stock first reached $50 in the late 1990s, particularly around 1998 or 1999.\n\n5. **NEXT STEPS**\n   - Continue to scroll through the historical price chart on Google Finance to locate the exact year when the stock price first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - If necessary, use the search function on Google Finance to find the specific date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n### Detailed Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Historical Price Chart**\n   - Open the Google Finance page for Apple (AAPL).\n   - Click on the \"Historical prices\" tab.\n   - Click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum historical data available.\n\n2. **Locate the First Year Above $50**\n   - Scroll through the historical price chart.\n   - Use the zoom feature or the timeline slider to focus on the period from the late 1990s to early 2000s.\n   - Identify the first year when the stock price went above $50.\n\n3. **Verify the Data**\n   - Check the specific date or month within the identified year to ensure the stock price is above $50.\n   - Ensure that the price is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n4. **Report the Findings**\n   - Clearly state the year when the stock first went above $50.\n   - Provide any additional context or verification details if necessary.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Focus on the Chart**: Ensure that the WebSurfer focuses on the historical price chart and not other sections of the page.\n- **Use Zoom and Timeline Slider**: Utilize the zoom feature and the timeline slider to narrow down the search to the relevant period.\n- **Verify Data Points**: Double-check the specific dates or months to confirm the stock price is above $50 and not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n### Instructions for WebSurfer\n\n1. **Navigate to the Historical Price Chart**\n   - Click on the \"Historical prices\" tab.\n   - Click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum historical data available.\n\n2. **Locate the First Year Above $50**\n   - Scroll through the historical price chart.\n   - Use the zoom feature or the timeline slider to focus on the period from the late 1990s to early 2000s.\n   - Identify the first year when the stock price went above $50.\n\n3. **Verify the Data**\n   - Check the specific date or month within the identified year to ensure the stock price is above $50.\n   - Ensure that the price is not adjusted for stock splits.\n\n4. **Report the Findings**\n   - Clearly state the year when the stock first went above $50.\n   - Provide any additional context or verification details if necessary.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan and locate the first year when the Apple stock price went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigation and Focus**: The WebSurfer did not consistently focus on the historical price chart and instead navigated to other sections of the page, such as news articles and financial statements.\n- **Lack of Specific Actions**: The instructions were too general and did not guide the WebSurfer to directly interact with the historical price chart or use specific features like the zoom function.\n- **Verification**: There was no explicit verification step to ensure that the correct data was being identified and recorded.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Historical Price Chart**\n   - Open the Google Finance page for Apple (AAPL).\n   - Click on the \"Historical prices\" tab.\n   - Click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum historical data available.\n\n2. **Locate the First Year Above $50**\n   -
