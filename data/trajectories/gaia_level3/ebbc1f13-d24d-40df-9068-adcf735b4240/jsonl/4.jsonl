Many traditions from Normandy came to the Yoles, such as the practice of Mumming, which is a type of acting, usually for a holiday. Language revitalization is an option for the Yola Language.An Updated Report on the Yola Language - GitHub Pagestheyolaproject.github.io\nHow did the Yola language change over time?\nAlthough it was isolated, the Yola language took up many Irish loanwords over time. The “Proto-Yola” language was first theoretically born when the Norman invasion of the area first started. Over time this new language took on Irish, Welsh, English, and Flemish influences due to its repeated colonization.An Updated Report on the Yola Language - GitHub Pagestheyolaproject.github.io\nHow is th pronounced in Yola?\nAswell, The way /th/ is pronounced in Yola is more of a /d/ or a /dh/.

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The word in question is \"gimlie\" from the Yola language.\n   - The Latin root of \"gimlie\" is derived from Late Latin \"camināta,\" which is related to the Spanish word \"camina.\"\n   - The source is the 1994 example sentence for the Spanish word \"camina\" in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online.\n   - The task involves translating the source title of the example sentence using Google Translate.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The 1994 example sentence for the Spanish word \"camina\" in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online.\n   - The source title of the 1994 example sentence.\n   - The Google translation of the source title.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact context and usage of the Spanish word \"camina\" in the 1994 example sentence.\n   - The accuracy and relevance of the Google translation of the source title.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Latin root \"camināta\" is related to the concept of a chimney or path, which aligns with the Yola word \"gimlie\" meaning chimney.\n   - The 1994 example sentence likely comes from a literary or academic source, which could provide additional context.\n   - The Google translation will likely be accurate but may require verification for idiomatic expressions or specific terminology.\n   - The 1994 example sentence might be part of a larger text or article, which could provide more context about the usage of \"camina.\"\n\n### Explanation of Updates:\n- **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**: Added the verified Latin root of \"gimlie\" and its relation to the Spanish word \"camina.\"\n- **FACTS TO LOOK UP**: Clarified the specific details we still need to find.\n- **FACTS TO DERIVE**: Added the context and usage of \"camina\" in the 1994 example sentence.\n- **EDUCATED GUESSES**: Expanded the guess about the Latin root and its relation to \"gimlie\" and \"camina.\" Added a guess about the potential source of the 1994 example sentence.\n\nThis updated fact sheet should help guide the next steps in solving the task. If you have any further information or need assistance with any specific part, please let me know!\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **CAPTCHA Issue**: The main obstacle was encountering a CAPTCHA on the Collins Dictionary page, which prevented automated access to the required information.\n- **Inability to Interact with CAPTCHA**: The WebSurfer and other team members cannot interact with CAPTCHAs, which are designed to block automated bots.\n- **Lack of Human Intervention**: Without human intervention to solve the CAPTCHA, the process was halted.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Human Interaction for CAPTCHA**: Since the team cannot solve CAPTCHAs, a human must complete the CAPTCHA to access the Collins Dictionary page.\n- **Detailed Instructions for Human**: Provide clear instructions for the human to complete the CAPTCHA and navigate to the specific example sentence.\n- **Automated Steps Post-CAPTCHA**: Once the CAPTCHA is solved, the WebSurfer can take over to find the 1994 example sentence and the source title.\n- **Google Translation**: Use Google Translate to get the English translation of the source title.\n\n### Detailed Plan:\n1. **Human Interaction**:\n   - **Step 1**: Ask the human to navigate to the Collins Dictionary page for the Spanish word \"camina\" at `https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/spanish-english/camina`.\n   - **Step 2**: Instruct the human to complete the CAPTCHA and ensure the page loads fully.\n   - **Step 3**: Once the CAPTCHA is solved, the human should confirm that the page is accessible.\n\n2. **WebSurfer Actions**:\n   - **Step 4**: Use the WebSurfer to navigate to the Collins Dictionary page for \"camina\" after the CAPTCHA is solved.\n   - **Step 5**: Search for the 1994 example sentence on the page.\n   - **Step 6**: Identify the source title of the 1994 example sentence.\n\n3. **Google Translation**:\n   - **Step 7**: Use the WebSurfer to navigate to Google Translate at `https://translate.google.com`.\n   - **Step 8**: Input the source title and obtain the English translation.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - **Step 9**: Use the Assistant to format and provide the final answer in plain text, without punctuation.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Human Interaction**: Clearly communicate the need for human intervention to solve the CAPTCHA and provide step-by-step instructions.\n- **WebSurfer Efficiency**: Ensure the WebSurfer waits for the page to load fully before attempting to locate the 1994 example sentence and source title.\n- **Google Translate Accuracy**: Verify the translation for accuracy, especially for idiomatic expressions or specific terminology.\n\nBy following this plan, we can effectively overcome the CAPTCHA issue and complete the task."}
