{"agent": "DataAnalysis_Expert", "content": "To tackle the problem of identifying the country with the least number of athletes at the 1928 Summer Olympics, I will first need a dataset that contains the information on the countries and the number of athletes they sent. Typically, this data would be in a CSV format. \n\nI will:\n1. Read the data from a CSV file containing the athlete counts for each country.\n2. Determine which country has the least number of athletes, resolving ties by alphabetical order.\n3. Extract and return the IOC country code for that country.\n\nPlease provide the CSV file containing the athletes data, or let me know if I should create a sample dataset to illustrate how this can be done."}
