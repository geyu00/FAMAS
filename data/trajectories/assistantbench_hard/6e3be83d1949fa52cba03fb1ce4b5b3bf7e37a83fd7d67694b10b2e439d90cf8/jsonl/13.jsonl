{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time for taking martial arts classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact address and surrounding area of the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - A list of martial arts studios or gyms within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - Class schedules for these martial arts studios, particularly those offered between 7-9 pm.\n   - Reviews and ratings of these martial arts studios to ensure quality and suitability.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n     - Google Maps for locations and walking distances.\n     - Official websites or social media pages of martial arts studios for class schedules and reviews.\n     - Local directories or community boards for additional listings.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The feasibility of attending classes based on the walking distance and the specified time frame.\n   - The availability of classes that fit the 7-9 pm slot and the proximity requirement.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely to be several fitness centers and martial arts studios in the financial district of New York City due to the high density of office workers.\n   - Some popular martial arts styles such as Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and Krav Maga may be more commonly offered in urban areas.\n   - Studios near the New York Stock Exchange are likely to cater to professionals, possibly offering evening classes to accommodate their schedules.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Location**: Use WebSurfer to find the exact address of the New York Stock Exchange.\n- **Find Nearby Martial Arts Studios**: Use WebSurfer to search for martial arts studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n- **Check Class Schedules**: For each identified studio, use WebSurfer to visit their official websites or social media pages to check if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n- **Verify Walking Distances**: Use WebSurfer to check Google Maps for the exact walking distances from the New York Stock Exchange to each studio to ensure they are within the five-minute walk.\n- **Review and Summarize**: Use WebSurfer to gather reviews and ratings of the identified studios to ensure they meet quality standards.\n- **Compile Results**: Use Assistant to compile the findings into a clear and concise report, including the names of the studios, their addresses, class schedules, and any relevant reviews or ratings."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time for taking martial arts classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n   - The address of the New York Stock Exchange is 11 Wall Street, New York City, NY 10005.\n   - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is located at 22 New Street, New York, NY 10005, which is very close to the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of martial arts studios or gyms within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - Class schedules for these martial arts studios, particularly those offered between 7-9 pm.\n   - Reviews and ratings of these martial arts studios to ensure quality and suitability.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n     - Google Maps for locations and walking distances.\n     - Official websites or social media pages of martial arts studios for class schedules and reviews.\n     - Local directories or community boards for additional listings.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The feasibility of attending classes based on the walking distance and the specified time frame.\n   - The availability of classes that fit the 7-9 pm slot and the proximity requirement.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely to be several fitness centers and martial arts studios in the financial district of New York City due to the high density of office workers.\n   - Some popular martial arts styles such as Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and Krav Maga may be more commonly offered in urban areas.\n   - Studios near the New York Stock Exchange are likely to cater to professionals, possibly offering evening classes to accommodate their schedules.\n   - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is a strong candidate for martial arts classes, given its proximity to the New York Stock Exchange and its positive reviews. However, we need to confirm the specific class times between 7-9 pm.\n   - Other potential studios in the area might include Modern Martial Arts Tribeca, Martial Arts Family Studio, Champions Martial Arts Brooklyn Heights, and STAND OUT. We should verify their class schedules and walking distances as well.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street**: Given its location and positive reviews, it is a strong candidate. However, we need to confirm the class times to ensure they fit the 7-9 pm slot.\n- **Other Potential Studios**: Based on the initial search results, these studios are in the vicinity and should be checked for class schedules and walking distances to ensure they meet the criteria.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Verify the class schedules for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, specifically for the 7-9 pm time slot.\n2. Check the walking distances from 11 Wall Street to the other identified studios.\n3. Verify the class schedules and walking distances for the other identified studios.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Repetition of Actions**: We repeatedly navigated to the same pages without successfully finding the detailed class schedules for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street.\n2. **Lack of Specific Search**: We did not perform a specific search for the class schedules on the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website or other reliable sources.\n3. **Incomplete Verification**: We did not verify the walking distances for all identified studios, focusing only on Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Specific Search for Class Schedules**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a specific search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule\" and navigate directly to the 'Schedule' page on their website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the schedule is not available on the website, search for class schedules on external review sites like Yelp or BJJ Metrics.\n\n2. **Verify Walking Distances**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to verify the walking distance from 11 Wall Street, New York City, NY 10005 to 22 New Street, New York, NY 10005.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Repeat the process for the other identified studios: Modern Martial Arts Tribeca, Martial Arts Family Studio, Champions Martial Arts Brooklyn Heights, and STAND OUT.\n\n3. **Check Class Schedules for Other Studios**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the official websites or social media pages of Modern Martial Arts Tribeca, Martial Arts Family Studio, Champions Martial Arts Brooklyn Heights, and STAND OUT.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for and verify the class schedules, particularly for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n\n4. **Compile Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the findings into a clear and concise report, including the names of the studios, their addresses, class schedules, and any relevant reviews or ratings.\n   - **Assistant**: Ensure the report includes the walking distances from 11 Wall Street to each studio.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Search for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street Class Schedule**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Type \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule\" into the browser search bar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the link to the official website and navigate to the 'Schedule' page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the schedule is not available, search for class schedules on external review sites like Yelp or BJJ Metrics.\n\n2. **Verify Walking Distance to Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open Google Maps and search for directions from 11 Wall Street, New York City, NY 10005 to 22 New Street, New York, NY 10005.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the walking distance and time.\n\n3. **Search for Class Schedules of Other Studios**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Type \"Modern Martial Arts Tribeca class schedule\" into the browser search bar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the official website and navigate to the 'Schedule' page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Repeat the process for Martial Arts Family Studio, Champions Martial Arts Brooklyn Heights, and STAND OUT.\n\n4. **Verify Walking Distances to Other Studios**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open Google Maps and search for directions from 11 Wall Street, New York City, NY 10005 to the addresses of Modern Martial Arts Tribeca, Martial Arts Family Studio, Champions Martial Arts Brooklyn Heights, and STAND OUT.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the walking distances and times.\n\n5. **Compile and Report**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the findings into a clear and concise report, including:\n     - Names of the studios.\n     - Addresses.\n     - Class schedules for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n     - Walking distances from 11 Wall Street.\n     - Any relevant reviews or ratings.\n\nBy following this new plan, we aim to avoid repetition, ensure specific and detailed searches, and provide a comprehensive report that meets the user's requirements."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time for taking martial arts classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n   - The address of the New York Stock Exchange is 11 Wall Street, New York City, NY 10005.\n   - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is located at 22 New Street, New York, NY 10005, which is very close to the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street operates from 5:45 AM to 9:00 PM on weekdays and from 9:30 AM to 2:00 PM on weekends.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of martial arts studios or gyms within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - Class schedules for these martial arts studios, particularly those offered between 7-9 pm.\n   - Reviews and ratings of these martial arts studios to ensure quality and suitability.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n     - Google Maps for locations and walking distances.\n     - Official websites or social media pages of martial arts studios for class schedules and reviews.\n     - Local directories or community boards for additional listings.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The feasibility of attending classes based on the walking distance and the specified time frame.\n   - The availability of classes that fit the 7-9 pm slot and the proximity requirement.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely to be several fitness centers and martial arts studios in the financial district of New York City due to the high density of office workers.\n   - Some popular martial arts styles such as Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and Krav Maga may be more commonly offered in urban areas.\n   - Studios near the New York Stock Exchange are likely to cater to professionals, possibly offering evening classes to accommodate their schedules.\n   - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is a strong candidate for martial arts classes, given its proximity to the New York Stock Exchange and its positive reviews. However, we need to confirm the specific class times between 7-9 pm.\n   - Other potential studios in the area might include Modern Martial Arts Tribeca, Martial Arts Family Studio, Champions Martial Arts Brooklyn Heights, and STAND OUT. We should verify their class schedules and walking distances as well.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street**: Given its location and positive reviews, it is a strong candidate. However, we need to confirm the class times to ensure they fit the 7-9 pm slot.\n- **Other Potential Studios**: Based on the initial search results, these studios are in the vicinity and should be checked for class schedules and walking distances to ensure they meet the criteria.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Verify the Class Schedule for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street**:\n   - Navigate to the official website or social media pages to find the detailed class schedule, specifically for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - If the schedule is not available on the official website, search for class schedules on external review sites like Yelp or BJJ Metrics.\n\n2. **Check the Walking Distance from 11 Wall Street to 22 New Street**:\n   - Use Google Maps to verify the walking distance from 11 Wall Street, New York City, NY 10005 to 22 New Street, New York, NY 10005.\n\n3. **Identify and Verify Other Potential Studios**:\n   - Search for and list other martial arts studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - Navigate to the official websites or social media pages of these studios to find their class schedules and reviews.\n   - Use Google Maps to verify the walking distances from 11 Wall Street to these studios.\n\n4. **Compile and Report**:\n   - Compile the findings into a clear and concise report, including the names of the studios, their addresses, class schedules, walking distances, and any relevant reviews or ratings.\n\nLet's start by verifying the class schedule for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street. Navigate to their official website or social media pages to find the detailed class schedule, specifically for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Repetition of Actions**: We repeatedly navigated to the same pages without successfully finding the detailed class schedules for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street.\n2. **Lack of Specific Search**: We did not perform a specific search for the class schedules on the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website or other reliable sources.\n3. **Incomplete Verification**: We did not verify the walking distances for all identified studios, focusing only on Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street.\n4. **Overlooking External Sources**: We did not effectively use external review sites like Yelp or social media pages to find the class schedules.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Specific Search for Class Schedules**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a specific search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule\" and navigate directly to the 'Schedule' page on their official website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the schedule is not available on the website, search for class schedules on external review sites like Yelp or BJJ Metrics.\n\n2. **Verify Walking Distance to Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to verify the walking distance from 11 Wall Street, New York City, NY 10005 to 22 New Street, New York, NY 10005.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the walking distance and time.\n\n3. **Search for Class Schedules of Other Studios**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Type \"martial arts studios near New York Stock Exchange\" into the browser search bar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify other potential studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the official websites or social media pages of these studios to find their class schedules, particularly for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n\n4. **Verify Walking Distances to Other Studios**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to verify the walking distances from 11 Wall Street, New York City, NY 10005 to the addresses of the identified studios.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the walking distances and times.\n\n5. **Compile and Report**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the findings into a clear and concise report, including:\n     - Names of the studios.\n     - Addresses.\n     - Class schedules for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n     - Walking distances from 11 Wall Street.\n     - Any relevant reviews or ratings.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Search for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street Class Schedule**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Type \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule\" into the browser search bar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the link to the official website and navigate to the 'Schedule' page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the schedule is not available, search for class schedules on external review sites like Yelp or BJJ Metrics.\n\n2. **Verify Walking Distance to Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open Google Maps and search for directions from 11 Wall Street, New York City, NY 10005 to 22 New Street, New York, NY 10005.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the walking distance and time.\n\n3. **Search for Other Martial Arts Studios**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Type \"martial arts studios near New York Stock Exchange\" into the browser search bar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify other potential studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the official websites or social media pages of these studios to find their class schedules, particularly for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n\n4. **Verify Walking Distances to Other Studios**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to verify the walking distances from 11 Wall Street, New York City, NY 10005 to the addresses of the identified studios.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the walking distances and times.\n\n5. **Compile and Report**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the findings into a clear and concise report, including:\n     - Names of the studios.\n     - Addresses.\n     - Class schedules for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n     - Walking distances from 11 Wall Street.\n     - Any relevant reviews or ratings.\n\nBy following this new plan, we aim to avoid repetition, ensure specific and detailed searches, and provide a comprehensive report that meets the user's requirements."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time for taking martial arts classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n   - The address of the New York Stock Exchange is 11 Wall Street, New York City, NY 10005.\n   - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is located at 22 New Street, New York, NY 10005, which is very close to the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street operates from 5:45 AM to 9:00 PM on weekdays and from 9:30 AM to 2:00 PM on weekends.\n   - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street has received positive reviews on platforms like Yelp and Facebook, indicating high-quality instruction and a welcoming environment.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of martial arts studios or gyms within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - Class schedules for these martial arts studios, particularly those offered between 7-9 pm.\n   - Reviews and ratings of these martial arts studios to ensure quality and suitability.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n     - Google Maps for locations and walking distances.\n     - Official websites or social media pages of martial arts studios for class schedules and reviews.\n     - Local directories or community boards for additional listings.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The feasibility of attending classes based on the walking distance and the specified time frame.\n   - The availability of classes that fit the 7-9 pm slot and the proximity requirement.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely to be several fitness centers and martial arts studios in the financial district of New York City due to the high density of office workers.\n   - Some popular martial arts styles such as Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and Krav Maga may be more commonly offered in urban areas.\n   - Studios near the New York Stock Exchange are likely to cater to professionals, possibly offering evening classes to accommodate their schedules.\n   - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is a strong candidate for martial arts classes, given its proximity to the New York Stock Exchange and its positive reviews. However, we need to confirm the specific class times between 7-9 pm.\n   - Other potential studios in the area might include Modern Martial Arts Tribeca, Martial Arts Family Studio, Champions Martial Arts Brooklyn Heights, and STAND OUT. We should verify their class schedules and walking distances as well.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street**: Given its location and positive reviews, it is a strong candidate. However, we need to confirm the class times to ensure they fit the 7-9 pm slot.\n- **Other Potential Studios**: Based on the initial search results, these studios are in the vicinity and should be checked for class schedules and walking distances to ensure they meet the criteria.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Verify the Class Schedule for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street**:\n   - Navigate to the official website or social media pages to find the detailed class schedule, specifically for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - If the schedule is not available on the official website, search for class schedules on external review sites like Yelp or BJJ Metrics.\n\n2. **Check the Walking Distance from 11 Wall Street to 22 New Street**:\n   - Use Google Maps to verify the walking distance from 11 Wall Street, New York City, NY 10005 to 22 New Street, New York, NY 10005.\n\n3. **Identify and Verify Other Potential Studios**:\n   - Search for and list other martial arts studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - Navigate to the official websites or social media pages of these studios to find their class schedules and reviews.\n   - Use Google Maps to verify the walking distances from 11 Wall Street to these studios.\n\n4. **Compile and Report**:\n   - Compile the findings into a clear and concise report, including the names of the studios, their addresses, class schedules, walking distances, and any relevant reviews or ratings.\n\n### Immediate Action\n1. **Search for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street Class Schedule**:\n   - Navigate to the official website or social media pages to find the detailed class schedule, specifically for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - If the schedule is not available on the official website, search for class schedules on external review sites like Yelp or BJJ Metrics.\n\n2. **Verify Walking Distance**:\n   - Use Google Maps to verify the walking distance from 11 Wall Street, New York City, NY 10005 to 22 New Street, New York, NY 10005.\n\nLet's start by navigating to the official website or social media pages of Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street to find the detailed class schedule, specifically for evening classes between 7-9 pm.
