What is this location called in the official script for the episode? Give the setting exactly as it appears in the first scene heading. Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify the location where the Doctor is trapped in Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who, as stated in the official script for the episode. Provide the setting exactly as it appears in the first scene heading.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The Doctor Who script expert will refer to the official script of Series 9, Episode 11 and provide the exact setting as it appears in the first scene heading.\n2. The Doctor Who episode analyst will cross-reference the information with their knowledge of the episode to ensure accuracy.\n3. The checker will verify the accuracy of the information provided by both experts.\n\n## Output format\nThe exact setting as it appears in the first scene heading of the official script for Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The setting must be provided exactly as it appears in the first scene heading of the official script.\n- The information must be verified by the checker for accuracy."}

Let's ensure that the provided information is accurate. \n\nThe setting you mentioned, \"INT. THE MAZE - DAY,\" must be verified for consistency with the episode's plot. The following steps will be taken to validate this:\n\n1. Confirm that \"THE MAZE\" is indeed the location where the Doctor is trapped as stated in Series 9, Episode 11.\n2. Check if there are any discrepancies in the script formatting or wording.\n3. Cross-reference with any available summaries or analyses of the episode for confirmation.\n\nI will now check the information by creating a verification code that will look for the specific scene heading in a script format. Please allow me a moment to run the code that will verify this detail accurately. \n\nHere’s the plan to validate this information:\n\n- I'll check the script for the exact phrase and see if it matches \"INT. THE MAZE - DAY.\"\n\nLet's proceed with that check. If I can have the script in a CSV format for quick parsing, I will validate the first scene heading using a Python script. \n\nCould you provide the file path to the CSV script?"}
