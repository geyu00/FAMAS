However, the script is currently returning an error. We need to debug the script and correct it.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Review the provided Python script to identify any syntax or logical errors.\n2. Correct the identified errors in the script.\n3. Test the corrected script with a sample input to ensure it works as expected.\n\n## Output format\n- The corrected Python script\n- The output of the script when tested with a sample input\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The script should correctly process the list of numbers and return the sum of the squares of the even numbers.\n- The script should handle edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with no even numbers.\n\n## Provided Python script\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\nresult = sum_of_squares_even(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```"}
{"agent": "PythonDebugging_Expert", "content": "First, let's review the provided Python script according to the plan outlined by the manager. The script seems to be correctly structured and there aren't any syntax errors. However, since the error message indicates that the function `seek_experts_help` is not found, it implies there might be an unrelated issue in the code execution or invocation context, rather than the script itself.\n\nGiven that, let's ensure that the script properly handles edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with no even numbers. I will implement these enhancements in the script:\n\n1. Add a check for an empty list.\n2. Test the function with a sample input that includes various edge cases.\n\nHere is the corrected Python script:\n\n```python\n# filename: sum_of_squares_even.py\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    if not numbers:  # Check if the list is empty\n        return 0\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\n# Testing with sample inputs, including edge cases\nsample_inputs = [\n    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],  # Normal case\n    [],  # Edge case: empty list\n    [1, 3, 5],  # Edge case: no even numbers\n    [2, 4, 6, 8]  # Edge case: only even numbers\n]\n\nresults = {str(input): sum_of_squares_even(input) for input in sample_inputs}\nprint(results)\n```\n\nNow let's execute this script to verify the output with the provided sample inputs."}
