{"agent": "DataAnalysis_Expert", "content": "To address the task effectively, I will follow the outlined plan:\n\n### Step 1: Review the Sample Dataset\nI need to confirm whether the dataset provided is representative of the actual data that would be available for the properties sold in Prince Edward Island. This would typically include looking at key attributes such as:\n- Square footage\n- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms\n- Sale date\n- Location details\n\nTo proceed, could you please provide the sample dataset that we should review? \n\n### Step 2: Verify the Function's Correctness\nOnce we have the dataset, I will review the code or function that is utilized to filter and find the smallest house that meets the criteria (at least 2 beds, 2 baths, sold in the specified date range). This includes checking:\n- Correctness of filter conditions\n- Logic to identify the smallest square footage\n\nAfter we have the dataset, I can help write and verify the function's effectiveness in processing this data. \n\nPlease share the sample dataset so I can begin with Step 1."}
