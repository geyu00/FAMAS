Since the Computer_terminal cannot execute anything without code, I'll create a plan that allows us to identify the chess position and find the correct move.\n\nI'll provide a Python script to help analyze the image and extract the chess position from it. Let's proceed with that.\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport pytesseract\n\n# Load the image\nimage_path = '../2023/validation/cca530fc-4052-43b2-b130-b30968d8aa44.png'\nimage = cv2.imread(image_path)\n\n# Convert the image to gray scale\ngray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n\n# Use pytesseract to extract text from the image\nextracted_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(gray_image)\n\n# Output the extracted text to understand the board position\nprint(extracted_text)\n```\n\nThis code will analyze the image and attempt to extract the chess board position as text, which can help us determine the current state of the game.
