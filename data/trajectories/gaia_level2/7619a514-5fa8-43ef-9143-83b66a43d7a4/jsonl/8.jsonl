{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when Regression was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The source for this information is GitHub.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when Regression was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - This information can be found by searching the numpy repository on GitHub for issues labeled \"Regression\" in the numpy.polynomial module, and then identifying the oldest closed issue with this label.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact date when the Regression label was added to the identified issue, which may require examining the issue's history or comments.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The numpy project is actively maintained, so it is likely that there are multiple issues labeled \"Regression\" in the numpy.polynomial module.\n   - The oldest closed issue with the Regression label might have been created several years ago, given the project's long history.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to navigate to the numpy repository on GitHub.\n- **Step 2:** Search for issues within the numpy.polynomial module that are labeled \"Regression.\"\n- **Step 3:** Filter the search results to show only closed issues.\n- **Step 4:** Identify the oldest closed issue with the Regression label.\n- **Step 5:** Examine the issue's history to find the date when the Regression label was added.\n- **Step 6:** Format the date in MM/DD/YY and report back."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and any new insights:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The source for this information is GitHub.\n   - The search query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression` did not return any results when initially filtered to the `numpy.polynomial` module.\n   - Manually browsing through the closed issues labeled \"Regression\" in the entire numpy repository is necessary to find the relevant issue.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - This information can be found by manually browsing through the closed issues labeled \"Regression\" in the numpy repository and identifying the oldest closed issue that involves the numpy.polynomial module.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the identified issue, which may require examining the issue's history or comments.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The numpy project is actively maintained, so it is likely that there are multiple issues labeled \"Regression\" in the numpy.polynomial module, even though the initial search did not return any results.\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label might have been created several years ago, given the project's long history.\n   - Since the initial search did not return any results, it is possible that the issues involving the numpy.polynomial module and labeled \"Regression\" are fewer and might be mixed among a larger set of issues. Therefore, manual inspection is necessary to ensure we don't miss any relevant issues.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The initial search query did not return any results, which suggests that either the issues are not as common as expected or they might be spread out among a larger set of issues.\n- Given the active maintenance of the numpy project, it is still reasonable to expect that there are some issues labeled \"Regression\" involving the numpy.polynomial module, but they might not be easily found with a direct search.\n- Manual inspection is a reliable method to ensure we don't miss any relevant issues, especially when automated searches do not yield results.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Incorrect Search Query**: The initial search query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression path:numpy/polynomial` did not return any results because it was too restrictive. The `path:numpy/polynomial` filter might not be the correct way to filter issues related to the numpy.polynomial module.\n- **Manual Inspection Needed**: Automated searches alone were not sufficient to find the relevant issues. Manual inspection of the closed issues labeled \"Regression\" is necessary to identify the oldest issue involving the numpy.polynomial module.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the numpy repository on GitHub.\n- **Step 2**: Perform a search for closed issues labeled \"Regression\" without any additional filters.\n- **Step 3**: Manually browse through the search results to identify closed issues that involve the numpy.polynomial module.\n- **Step 4**: Identify the oldest closed issue that involves the numpy.polynomial module and has the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Step 5**: Examine the issue's history to find the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Step 6**: Format the date in MM/DD/YY and report back.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to the numpy repository on GitHub.\n  - URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`\n- **Step 2**: Perform a search for closed issues labeled \"Regression\".\n  - Search Query: `is:issue is:closed label:Regression`\n- **Step 3**: Manually browse through the search results to identify closed issues that involve the numpy.polynomial module.\n  - Look for keywords like \"polynomial\", \"numpy.polynomial\", or similar in the issue titles and descriptions.\n- **Step 4**: Identify the oldest closed issue that involves the numpy.polynomial module and has the \"Regression\" label.\n  - Sort the search results by \"Oldest\" to find the oldest issue.\n- **Step 5**: Examine the issue's history to find the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n  - Click on the issue to open it.\n  - Scroll through the comments and events to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Step 6**: Format the date in MM/DD/YY and report back.\n\n### Hints\n- **Hint 1**: When manually browsing through the issues, look for keywords related to the numpy.polynomial module in the issue titles and descriptions.\n- **Hint 2**: If the search results are overwhelming, you can use the \"Sort by\" option to sort the issues by \"Oldest\" to quickly find the oldest issues.\n- **Hint 3**: When examining the issue's history, look for the \"Labeled\" event that corresponds to the \"Regression\" label.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and any new insights:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The source for this information is GitHub.\n   - The search query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy` did not return any results initially, possibly due to a typo or incorrect formatting.\n   - Manually browsing through the closed issues labeled \"Regression\" in the entire numpy repository is necessary to find the relevant issue.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - This information can be found by manually browsing through the closed issues labeled \"Regression\" in the numpy repository and identifying the oldest closed issue that involves the numpy.polynomial module.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the identified issue, which may require examining the issue's history or comments.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The numpy project is actively maintained, so it is likely that there are multiple issues labeled \"Regression\" in the numpy.polynomial module, even though the initial search did not return any results.\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label might have been created several years ago, given the project's long history.\n   - Since the initial search did not return any results, it is possible that the issues involving the numpy.polynomial module and labeled \"Regression\" are fewer and might be mixed among a larger set of issues. Therefore, manual inspection is necessary to ensure we don't miss any relevant issues.\n   - The search query might need to be refined further to avoid typos or incorrect formatting. For example, the correct query should be `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy`.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The initial search query did not return any results, which suggests that there might have been a typo or incorrect formatting. The correct query should be `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy`.\n- Given the active maintenance of the numpy project, it is still reasonable to expect that there are some issues labeled \"Regression\" involving the numpy.polynomial module, but they might not be easily found with a direct search.\n- Manual inspection is a reliable method to ensure we don't miss any relevant issues, especially when automated searches do not yield results.\n- The numpy project has a long history, so the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label might have been created several years ago.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the numpy repository on GitHub.\n- **Step 2**: Perform a search for closed issues labeled \"Regression\" using the correct query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy`.\n- **Step 3**: Manually browse through the search results to identify closed issues that involve the numpy.polynomial module.\n- **Step 4**: Identify the oldest closed issue that involves the numpy.polynomial module and has the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Step 5**: Examine the issue's history to find the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Step 6**: Format the date in MM/DD/YY and report back.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to the numpy repository on GitHub.\n  - URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`\n- **Step 2**: Perform a search for closed issues labeled \"Regression\" using the correct query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy`.\n- **Step 3**: Manually browse through the search results to identify closed issues that involve the numpy.polynomial module.\n  - Look for keywords like \"polynomial\", \"numpy.polynomial\", or similar in the issue titles and descriptions.\n- **Step 4**: Identify the oldest closed issue that involves the numpy.polynomial module and has the \"Regression\" label.\n  - Sort the search results by \"Oldest\" to find the oldest issue.\n- **Step 5**: Examine the issue's history to find the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n  - Click on the issue to open it.\n  - Scroll through the comments and events to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Step 6**: Format the date in MM/DD/YY and report back.\n\n### Hints\n- **Hint 1**: When manually browsing through the issues, look for keywords related to the numpy.polynomial module in the issue titles and descriptions.\n- **Hint 2**: If the search results are overwhelming, you can use the \"Sort by\" option to sort the issues by \"Oldest\" to quickly find the oldest issues.\n- **Hint 3**: When examining the issue's history, look for the \"Labeled\" event that corresponds to the \"Regression\" label.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Incorrect Search Query**: The search query used contained a typo and was overly complex, leading to no results being returned. The correct query should be `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy`.\n- **Manual Inspection Required**: Even with the correct search query, manual inspection is necessary to identify the oldest closed issue involving the numpy.polynomial module and the \"Regression\" label.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the numpy repository on GitHub.\n  - URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`\n- **Step 2**: Perform a search for closed issues labeled \"Regression\" using the correct query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy`.\n- **Step 3**: Manually browse through the search results to identify closed issues that involve the numpy.polynomial module.\n  - Look for keywords like \"polynomial\", \"numpy.polynomial\", or similar in the issue titles and descriptions.\n- **Step 4**: Identify the oldest closed issue that involves the numpy.polynomial module and has the \"Regression\" label.\n  - Sort the search results by \"Oldest\" to find the oldest issue.\n- **Step 5**: Examine the issue's history to find the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n  - Click on the issue to open it.\n  - Scroll through the comments and events to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Step 6**: Format the date in MM/DD/YY and report back.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to the numpy repository on GitHub.\n  - URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`\n- **Step 2**: Perform a search for closed issues labeled \"Regression\" using the correct query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy`.\n  - Ensure the query is entered correctly and without typos.\n- **Step 3**: Manually browse through the search results to identify closed issues that involve the numpy.polynomial module.\n  - Look for keywords like \"polynomial\", \"numpy.polynomial\", or similar in the issue titles and descriptions.\n- **Step 4**: Identify the oldest closed issue that involves the numpy.polynomial module and has the \"Regression\" label.\n  - Sort the search results by \"Oldest\" to find the oldest issue.\n- **Step 5**: Examine the issue's history to find the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n  - Click on the issue to open it.\n  - Scroll through the comments and events to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Step 6**: Format the date in MM/DD/YY and report back.\n\n### Hints\n- **Hint 1**: Double-check the search query to ensure it is correct and free of typos.\n- **Hint 2**: Use the \"Sort by\" option to sort the issues by \"Oldest\" to quickly find the oldest issues.\n- **Hint 3**: When examining the issue's history, look for the \"Labeled\" event that corresponds to the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Hint 4**: If the search results are still overwhelming, narrow down the search by using additional keywords like \"polynomial\" in the search query.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and any new insights:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n- The request is about finding the date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n- The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n- The source for this information is GitHub.\n- The search query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy` did not return any results initially, possibly due to a typo or incorrect formatting.\n- Manually browsing through the closed issues labeled \"Regression\" in the entire numpy repository is necessary to find the relevant issue.\n\n#### 2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n- The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n- This information can be found by manually browsing through the closed issues labeled \"Regression\" in the numpy repository and identifying the oldest closed issue that involves the numpy.polynomial module.\n\n#### 3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n- The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the identified issue, which may require examining the issue's history or comments.\n\n#### 4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n- The numpy project is actively maintained, so it is likely that there are multiple issues labeled \"Regression\" in the numpy.polynomial module, even though the initial search did not return any results.\n- The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label might have been created several years ago, given the project's long history.\n- Since the initial search did not return any results, it is possible that the issues involving the numpy.polynomial module and labeled \"Regression\" are fewer and might be mixed among a larger set of issues. Therefore, manual inspection is necessary to ensure we don't miss any relevant issues.\n- The search query might need to be refined further to avoid typos or incorrect formatting. For example, the correct query should be `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy`.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The initial search query did not return any results, which suggests that there might have been a typo or incorrect formatting. The correct query should be `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy`.\n- Given the active maintenance of the numpy project, it is still reasonable to expect that there are some issues labeled \"Regression\" involving the numpy.polynomial module, but they might not be easily found with a direct search.\n- Manual inspection is a reliable method to ensure we don't miss any relevant issues, especially when automated searches do not yield results.\n- The numpy project has a long history, so the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label might have been created several years ago.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the numpy repository on GitHub.\n- **Step 2**: Perform a search for closed issues labeled \"Regression\" using the correct query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy`.\n- **Step 3**: Manually browse through the search results to identify closed issues that involve the numpy.polynomial module.\n- **Step 4**: Identify the oldest closed issue that involves the numpy.polynomial module and has the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Step 5**: Examine the issue's history to find the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Step 6**: Format the date in MM/DD/YY and report back.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to the numpy repository on GitHub.\n  - URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`\n- **Step 2**: Perform a search for closed issues labeled \"Regression\" using the correct query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy`.\n  - Ensure the query is entered correctly and without typos.\n- **Step 3**: Manually browse through the search results to identify closed issues that involve the numpy.polynomial module.\n  - Look for keywords like \"polynomial\", \"numpy.polynomial\", or similar in the issue titles and descriptions.\n- **Step 4**: Identify the oldest closed issue that involves the numpy.polynomial module and has the \"Regression\" label.\n  - Sort the search results by \"Oldest\" to find the oldest issue.\n- **Step 5**: Examine the issue's history to find the date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n  - Click on the issue to open it.\n  - Scroll through the comments and events to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Step 6**: Format the date in MM/DD/YY and report back.\n\n### Hints\n- **Hint 1**: When manually browsing through the issues, look for keywords related to the numpy.polynomial module in the issue titles and descriptions.\n- **Hint 2**: If the search results are overwhelming, you can use the \"Sort by\" option to sort the issues by \"Oldest\" to quickly find the oldest issues.\n- **Hint 3**: When examining the issue's history, look for the \"Labeled\" event that corresponds to the \"Regression\" label.\n\n### Additional Hunch\n- **Hunch 1**: The issue might be older and less frequently referenced, so it might not appear in the first few pages of search results. Be thorough in your manual inspection.\n- **Hunch 2**: The \"Regression\" label might have been added later in the issue's lifecycle, so check the entire history of the issue for the label addition event.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Incorrect Search Query**: The initial search query used contained a typo or was incorrectly formatted, leading to no results being returned.\n- **Manual Inspection Required**: Automated searches did not yield the desired results, necessitating manual inspection of the issues.\n- **Overlooking Filters**: The filters were not properly applied to show only closed issues labeled 'Regression'.\n- **Sorting by Oldest**: The issues were not sorted by 'Oldest', which is crucial for identifying the oldest closed issue.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the numpy repository on GitHub.\n  - URL: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`\n- **Step 2**: Perform a search for closed issues labeled 'Regression' using the correct query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression repo:numpy/numpy`.\n  - Ensure the query is entered correctly and without typos.\n- **Step 3**: Apply filters to show only closed issues labeled 'Regression'.\n  - Click on 'Filters' and select 'Closed' and 'Regression'.\n- **Step 4**: Sort the filtered issues by 'Oldest'.\n  - Use the 'Sort by' dropdown and select 'Oldest'.\n- **Step 5**: Manually browse through the sorted issues to identify the oldest closed issue that involves the numpy.polynomial module.\n  - Look for keywords like 'polynomial', 'numpy.polynomial', or similar in the issue titles and descriptions.\n- **Step 6**: Identify the oldest closed issue that involves the numpy.polynomial module and has the 'Regression' label.\n- **Step 7**: Examine the issue's history to find the date when the 'Regression' label was added.\n  - Click on the issue to open it.\n  - Scroll through the comments and events to find when the 'Regression' label was added.\n- **Step 8**: Format the date in MM/DD/YY and report back.\n\n### Hints\n- **Hint 1**: Double-check the search query to ensure it is correct and free of typos.\n- **Hint 2**: Use the 'Filters' to narrow down the issues to only closed issues labeled 'Regression'.\n- **Hint 3**: Sort the issues by 'Oldest' to quickly find the oldest issues.\n- **Hint 4**: When examining the issue's history, look for the \"Labeled\" event that corresponds to the 'Regression' label.\n- **Hint 5**: Be thorough in your manual inspection, as the relevant issue might not be immediately obvious.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}
