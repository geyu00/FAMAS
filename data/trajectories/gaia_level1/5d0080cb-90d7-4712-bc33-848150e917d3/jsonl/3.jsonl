It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The paper in question is titled \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?\"\n   - The paper was published by the University of Leicester.\n   - The paper states that Toothless would require 716 kg of fish over a specific period to meet his dietary needs.\n   - The paper mentions that this calculation includes 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon each day.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific volume in m³ of the fish bag as reported in the University of Leicester paper \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?\"\n   - The publication date and authors of the paper for verification purposes.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: The University of Leicester's official repository or academic database, such as Google Scholar or JSTOR.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No derivations are necessary if the volume is directly stated in the paper.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The volume of the fish bag is likely to be a significant amount, considering the dietary needs of a dragon, which require 716 kg of fish over a specific period. Given that 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon are needed daily, the fish bag must be large enough to hold a substantial quantity of fish.\n   - **New Guess**: The volume of the fish bag is likely to be around 1-2 m³. This estimate is based on the assumption that the fish need to be packed efficiently, and the total weight of 716 kg over a specific period suggests a considerable volume. However, this is still speculative and needs to be confirmed from the paper.\n\n**Reasoning for New Guess**:\n- The paper specifies a significant amount of fish (716 kg) required over a specific period.\n- The daily requirement of 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon suggests a large volume of fish.\n- A volume of 1-2 m³ is a reasonable estimate for holding such a quantity of fish, considering the size and density of the fish.\n\nLet's proceed to find the exact volume in the paper. Navigate to the following link: https://journals.le.ac.uk/index.php/jist/article/view/Can-Hiccup-Supply-Enough-Fish-to-Maintain-a-Dragons-Diet. If the link works, search for the specific volume in m³ of the fish bag and provide the exact figure and context. If the link does not work, try another source like Google Scholar or the University of Leicester's official repository.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Incorrect Link**: The direct link to the paper on the University of Leicester's repository was incorrect or outdated, leading to a 404 error.\n- **Access Issues**: When accessing JSTOR, an access check (reCAPTCHA) was encountered, which prevented us from directly accessing the paper.\n- **Ineffective Search Queries**: The search queries used to find the paper on other platforms (ResearchGate, Academia.edu) did not yield the specific paper we were looking for.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Verify the Correct Link**: Use a more precise search query to find the correct link to the paper on the University of Leicester's official repository.\n- **Use Alternative Sources**: If the official repository does not work, use Google Scholar to find the paper and download it.\n- **Avoid Access Checks**: If encountering access checks, try downloading the paper in PDF format and search within the PDF.\n- **Direct Search for Volume**: Once the paper is accessible, perform a direct search for the term \"volume\" or \"m³\" to find the specific volume of the fish bag.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a search using the query \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet? University of Leicester\" on Google.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Click on the first few results to find the correct link to the paper on the University of Leicester's official repository.\n3. **WebSurfer**: If the official repository link does not work, use Google Scholar to search for the paper and download it in PDF format.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Once the paper is open, perform a search for the terms \"volume\" or \"m³\" to find the specific volume of the fish bag.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Extract the exact figure and context and provide the information.\n6. **Assistant**: Review the extracted information and prepare a concise answer to the original request."}

In the 2010 film, Toothless is struck\ndown  during  a  dragon  raid  and  loses  his  left  tail-fin,  leaving  him  trapped  in  a  sunken  area.  This  paper\ninvestigates  the  feasibility  of  Hiccup,  a  teenage  boy,  being  able  to  supply  enough  fish  to  maintain  the\ndragon’s diet by catching and bringing fish to him. It was found that in the twelve days that Toothless was\ntrapped, he would have required 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, which totalled 716 kg.\nHiccup  would  have  had  to  carry  828  fish  weighing  at  total  of  8592  kg  over  the  twelve  days,  which  is\nunrealistic since he struggles to lift a shield in combat.\n\nIntroduction\nThe  How  to  Train  Your  Dragon  franchise  is  loosely\nbased on the popular book series by Cressida Cowell\n[1]. The events take  place in  Viking  Scotland, in the\nsmall village of Berk which is repeatedly attacked by\ndragons. One of the  deadliest  dragon  species  is the\nNight Fury, which was previously unseen by any living\nperson.  It  is  described  as  the  “unholy  offspring  of\nlightning  and  death  itself”  due  to  its  speed  and\ncamouflage abilities [2]. Toothless is the only known\nNight Fury, and is shown to be intelligent and playful\nwhile also deadly.\n\nHiccup Horrendous Haddock III, the main protagonist,\nis  a  small  teenage  boy  eager  to  prove  himself  as  a\nViking. Using an invention which closely resembles a\nnet  gun,  Hiccup  strikes  down  Toothless  during  a\ndragon  raid.  Toothless’  left  caudal  fin  is  severed,\nrendering him unable to fly out of the sunken area,\nknown as The Cove [3]. Fish are a large component of\nis  exclusively\na  dragon’s  diet,  and  Toothless\ndependent  on  fish  for  nutrition  [4].  This  paper\ninvestigates  whether  Hiccup  is  able  to  maintain\nToothless’ feeding habits while he is trapped in The\nCove.\n\nAssumptions\nSeveral  assumptions  and  simplifications  must  be\nmade  to  calculate  the  required  values.  During  the\ntime  lapse  montages  in  the  film,  it  is  taken  that\n\nToothless is in The Cove for a total of twelve days [5].\nIt is assumed that Hiccup visited once a day for the\nduration of Toothless’ stay.\n\nOn  the  third  day,  Hiccup  brings  a  sack  of  fish,  and\nmentions that it contains Icelandic cod and salmon.\nThere  is  also  a  pond  in  the  clearing,  and  one  scene\nshows  Toothless  hunting  for  fish.  However,  in  this\npaper,  it  is  assumed  that  Toothless  relies  solely  on\nHiccup for nutrition. During his time in The Cove, it is\nassumed  that  his  diet  consists  of  only  salmon  and\ncod. It is also assumed that each sack contained the\nsame amount of fish, and that he received the same\namount every day for twelve days.\n\nThe sack is modelled as a cylinder, while the fish have\nbeen modelled as prolate spheroids (see Appendix for\nvisual aids).\n\nFigure 1 – Comparison of size of Hiccup to bag [5].\n\nSize of the bag\nHiccup is said to be 1.625 m tall [6], and using average\nmale  proportions,  the  bag  appears  to  be  3/8  of  his\nheight [7]. Therefore, the height of the bag,\n\n:\n\n𝐻𝐻𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏\n\n\fCan Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?
