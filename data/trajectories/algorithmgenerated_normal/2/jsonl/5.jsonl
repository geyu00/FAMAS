Please make sure you have the dataset ready, and let me know its file path. I will write the following code to read the CSV and process the information.\n\n```python\n# filename: olympics_data_analysis.py\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data\ndata = pd.read_csv('olympics_1928.csv')  # Ensure the correct path to your CSV file\n\n# Finding the country with the least number of athletes\nleast_athletes = data.loc[data['Number of Athletes'].idxmin()]\n\n# Handling ties by selecting alphabetically first\ncountries_with_least = data[data['Number of Athletes'] == least_athletes['Number of Athletes']]\nresult_country = countries_with_least.loc[countries_with_least['Country'].idxmin()]\n\n# Output the IOC country code\nprint(result_country['IOC Country Code'])\n```\n\nPlease execute this code on the Computer_terminal after you provide the correct CSV file path."}
