Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO.\n   - Fubo's IPO took place on October 13, 2020.\n   - The request asks about members of Fubo's Management Team who joined the company during the same year as the IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The names and join dates of Fubo's current Management Team.\n   - These details can be found on Fubo's official website, SEC filings, press releases, and possibly in news articles covering the company's IPO and management changes.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the join dates of the Management Team members with the year 2020 to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Fubo's IPO occurred in 2020, which aligns with the rapid growth of streaming services and the company's strategic positioning.\n   - Key executives often join a company around the time of significant milestones like an IPO, but this is not certain without verification.\n   - The Management Team page on Fubo's official website might not be directly accessible via a specific URL, suggesting that the information might be embedded within other sections of the site or available through press releases and SEC filings.\n\n**Additional Hunches:**\n   - Given that the direct link to the Management Team page did not work, it might be useful to look for the Management Team information on the main 'Overview' page or in the 'News' section of the Investor Relations site.\n   - Press releases and SEC filings from around the time of the IPO (2020) are likely to contain detailed information about management changes and key hires.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to gather the required information:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit Fubo's official Investor Relations page and navigate to the 'Overview' or 'News' sections to find the Management Team information.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for press releases and SEC filings from 2020 to find details about management changes and key hires.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect URL**: The direct link to the Management Team page (`https://ir.fubo.tv/management-team/default.aspx`) resulted in a \"Page Not Found\" error, indicating that the URL might be incorrect or the page might not exist.\n- **Limited Navigation**: The previous attempts to navigate through the site did not lead to the Management Team section, possibly due to a lack of exploration of all available sections and sub-sections.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Main Investor Relations Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the main Investor Relations page (`https://ir.fubo.tv`).\n\n2. **Explore the 'Overview' Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Overview' section to see if the Management Team information is included there.\n\n3. **Check the 'News' Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the 'Overview' section does not contain the Management Team information, navigate to the 'News' section and look for press releases or announcements from 2020 that mention new hires or management changes.\n\n4. **Search for SEC Filings**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for Fubo's SEC filings from 2020 to find detailed information about the Management Team and their join dates.\n\n5. **Cross-Reference Join Dates with IPO Year**\n   - **Assistant**: Once the join dates of the Management Team members are identified, cross-reference these dates with the year 2020 to determine who joined in the same year as the IPO.\n\n6. **Compile and Present the Results**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and present the names of the Management Team members who joined in 2020.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Open the Main Investor Relations Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to `https://ir.fubo.tv`.\n\n2. **Click on the 'Overview' Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Overview' section and scroll through the page to look for any information about the Management Team.\n\n3. **Check the 'News' Section**\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the 'Overview' section does not contain the required information, click on the 'News' section and look for press releases or announcements from 2020.\n\n4. **Search for SEC Filings**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using a query like \"Fubo SEC filings 2020\" to find relevant documents.\n\n5. **Cross-Reference Join Dates**\n   - **Assistant**: Once the join dates are identified, compare them with the year 2020 to find the relevant team members.\n\n6. **Summarize and Present Results**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final list of Management Team members who joined in 2020 and present the results.\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to gather the necessary information and avoid the issues encountered in the previous attempt."}
