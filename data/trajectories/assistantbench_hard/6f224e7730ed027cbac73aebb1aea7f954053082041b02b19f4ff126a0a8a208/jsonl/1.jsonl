{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich members of Fubo's Management Team joined the company during the same year Fubo's IPO happened?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO.\n   - The question asks about members of Fubo's Management Team who joined the company in the same year as the IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The year Fubo went public (IPO year).\n   - The names and join dates of the current members of Fubo's Management Team.\n   - These facts can be found on Fubo’s official website, SEC filings, press releases, and possibly in news articles covering the company's IPO and management changes.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the join dates of the Management Team members with the IPO year to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Fubo's IPO likely occurred within the last few years, given the rapid growth of streaming services.\n   - Key executives often join a company around the time of significant milestones like an IPO, so it's plausible that some high-profile hires were made in the same year.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the IPO Year of Fubo:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search to find the exact year Fubo went public (IPO year).\n\n- **Gather Information on Fubo's Management Team:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Visit Fubo’s official website and navigate to the section listing the current Management Team. Collect the names and join dates of the team members.\n\n- **Cross-Reference Join Dates with IPO Year:**\n  - **Assistant:** Compare the join dates of the Management Team members with the IPO year to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n- **Compile and Present the Final List:**\n  - **Assistant:** Summarize the findings and provide a list of the Management Team members who joined Fubo in the same year as the IPO."}
