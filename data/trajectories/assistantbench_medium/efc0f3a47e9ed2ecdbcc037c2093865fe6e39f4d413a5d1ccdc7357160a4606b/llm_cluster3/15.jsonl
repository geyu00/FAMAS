{"index": 56, "agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "action": "instruct", "state": "We are working to address the following user request: Which Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024? To answer this request we have assembled the following team: Assistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills. ComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks). FileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files. WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded. Here is an initial fact sheet to consider: ### Updated Fact Sheet #### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual fund. - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees. - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024. - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period. - Fidelity International offers a variety of investment solutions and has a presence in multiple regions, including the United Kingdom. - The Fidelity International website for the United Kingdom is accessible at https://www.fidelity.co.uk/. #### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP - A comprehensive list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds. - The transaction fees associated with each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees. - The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each eligible fund at the start (May 2019) and end (May 2024) of the specified period. - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial databases like Morningstar, or other reputable financial news and data platforms. #### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE - Calculate the percentage increase for each eligible fund using the formula: \\(\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{End Value} - \\text{Start Value}}{\\text{Start Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\). - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase based on the calculated values. #### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES - Given the volatility of emerging markets, it is likely that some funds may have experienced negative returns or very low positive returns during the specified period. - Fidelity often offers multiple funds within the same category, so there could be several options to consider. - The performance of these funds can be influenced by various factors such as market conditions, management strategies, and geopolitical events, but without specific data, these are just educated guesses. - **New Guess**: Since we are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase, it is possible that the fund with the lowest performance might be one that has been more conservative in its investment approach, focusing on stability rather than high growth. This could be a fund that invests in a broader range of emerging markets rather than concentrating on high-growth but high-risk sectors. - **Additional Guess**: The fund with the lowest percentage increase might also be one that has a higher focus on risk management and diversification, which could have helped it weather market downturns better than more aggressive funds. - **Updated Guess**: Based on the search results and the structure of the Fidelity website, it appears that the search functionality might not be returning the most relevant results. It might be more effective to navigate directly to the 'Funds' section and use the filters provided there to find the relevant funds. ### Updated Plan: 1. **Navigate to Fidelity International Website:** - **WebSurfer**: Go to the Fidelity International website (https://www.fidelity.co.uk/). - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the location is set to 'United Kingdom'. - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Funds' section. 2. **Search for Relevant Funds:** - **WebSurfer**: Use the search function within the 'Funds' section to look for 'Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds'. - **WebSurfer**: Apply the filter for $0 transaction fees. 3. **Collect Fund List:** - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and identifiers (e.g., ISIN codes) of the relevant funds. - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the list is comprehensive and accurate. 4. **Collect Historical Data:** - **WebSurfer**: For each identified fund, navigate to its historical performance page. - **WebSurfer**: Record the net asset value (NAV) or share price for May 2019 and May 2024. - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the data is accurate and from a reliable source. 5. **Calculate Percentage Increase:** - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each fund using the collected data. - **Assistant**: Run the script to identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase. 6. **Verify and Report:** - **Assistant**: Verify the results and prepare a final report. - **Assistant**: Present the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the calculated percentage increase. ### Detailed Instructions for WebSurfer: 1. **Navigate to Fidelity International Website:** - Open the web browser and go to https://www.fidelity.co.uk/. - Ensure the location is set to 'United Kingdom'. 2. **Navigate to the 'Funds' Section:** - Click on 'Funds' in the main navigation menu. - Ensure you are in the 'Funds' section. 3. **Search for Relevant Funds:** - Use the search function within the 'Funds' section to look for 'Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds'. - Apply the filter for $0 transaction fees. - If the search function does not provide the desired results, manually navigate to the 'Investment Finder' or 'Select 50' sections and apply the necessary filters. 4. **Collect Fund List:** - Extract the names and identifiers (e.g., ISIN codes) of the relevant funds. - Ensure the list is comprehensive and accurate. 5. **Collect Historical Data:** - For each identified fund, navigate to its historical performance page. - Record the net asset value (NAV) or share price for May 2019 and May 2024. - Ensure the data is accurate and from a reliable source. ### Python Script Example: ```python # Sample Python script to calculate percentage increase funds = { 'Fund A': {'May_2019': 100, 'May_2024': 120}, 'Fund B': {'May_2019': 150, 'May_2024': 160}, 'Fund C': {'May_2019': 200, 'May_2024': 210} } def calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value): return ((end_value - start_value) / start_value) * 100 results = {} for fund, values in funds.items(): start_value = values['May_2019'] end_value = values['May_2024'] percentage_increase = calculate_percentage_increase(start_value, end_value) results[fund] = percentage_increase # Find the fund with the lowest percentage increase lowest_increase_fund = min(results, key=results.get) lowest_increase_value = results[lowest_increase_fund] print(f'The fund with the lowest percentage increase is {lowest_increase_fund} with an increase of {lowest_increase_value:.2f}%.') ``` ### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes: - **Specific Search Terms**: Use specific search terms like 'Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds UK' to narrow down the results. - **Direct Navigation**: Directly navigate to the 'Funds' section and use the filters provided on the website to find the relevant funds. - **Data Verification**: Double-check the accuracy of the historical data collected to ensure it is from the correct time periods and sources. - **Detailed Instructions**: Provide detailed instructions to the WebSurfer to ensure they navigate and extract data correctly. - **Manual Backup**: If the search function does not work as expected, manually navigate to the 'Investment Finder' or 'Select 50' sections and apply the necessary filters. Let's proceed with the next steps to gather the necessary data. **Next Step:** - **WebSurfer**: Go to the Fidelity International website (https://www.fidelity.co.uk/). - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the location is set to 'United Kingdom'. - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Funds' section. - **WebSurfer**: Use the search function within the 'Funds' section to look for 'Emerging Markets Equity mutual funds'. - **WebSurfer**: Apply the filter for $0 transaction fees. - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and identifiers (e.g., ISIN codes) of the relevant funds."}
