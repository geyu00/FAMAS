I think I have to recognise that the project was ultimately not as effective at 'unveiling' the author as I had hoped and was thus also not enough to endow Trevisa with those paternal qualities I was presumably looking for. obscured not by a 'veil of print' but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission.\"\n\n### Comparing with in-line citation:\nThe quoted text in the in-line citation appears to be a direct quote from the article:\n- **Exact Match:** The phrase \"obscured not by a 'cloak of print' but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission\" can be found in the article as intended.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe quoted text from the in-line citation matches the text found in the article.
