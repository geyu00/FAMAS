Then, it \"burps out\" an energetic, highly magnetized blast of energy and plasma. That seems the most likely explanation for the appearance of the bubbles and filaments. It's possible that such a jet collided with clouds of gas and dust in the immediate neighborhood. It could have led to twisted magnetic structures that form the filaments.\nAnother idea is that molecular gas got stretched by the expansion of the material near the core. That somehow creates the radial filaments. Such action would also explain the lopsided appearance of the Sgr E complex. It lies to one side of the black hole at the intersection of the central molecular zone and a wide central dust lane. Finally, it's also possible that the gravitational potential of our galaxy's central bar is tugging the Sgr E cloud. That could play a role in forming those filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Yusef-Zadeh and his team suggest a couple of ideas for their existence. The first is cosmic-ray pressure forcing filaments into a vertical orientation. That pressure is the aftermath of the explosive event a few million years ago that created the bubbles.\nSome verticals could be the result of the interaction of a large-scale wind in the region and obstacles embedded within the flow. That combination creates filaments by wrapping the wind's magnetic field around the obstacles. Clearly, there's a lot of observation work and analysis to be done in order to really understand what's happening to create both sets of filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Then, it \"burps out\" an energetic, highly magnetized blast of energy and plasma. That seems the most likely explanation for the appearance of the bubbles and filaments. It's possible that such a jet collided with clouds of gas and dust in the immediate neighborhood. It could have led to twisted magnetic structures that form the filaments.\nAnother idea is that molecular gas got stretched by the expansion of the material near the core. That somehow creates the radial filaments. Such action would also explain the lopsided appearance of the Sgr E complex. It lies to one side of the black hole at the intersection of the central molecular zone and a wide central dust lane. Finally, it's also possible that the gravitational potential of our galaxy's central bar is tugging the Sgr E cloud. That could play a role in forming those filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Many research questions from the social sciences do, however, not only require the detection of the emotion of an author of a post but to understand who is ascribed an emotion in text. This task is tackled by emotion role labeling which aims at extracting who is described in text to experience an emotion, why, and towards whom. This could, however, be considered overly sophisticated if the main question to answer is who feels which emotion. A targeted approach for such setup is to classify emotion experiencer mentions (aka \"emoters\") regarding the emotion they presumably perceive. This task is similar to named entity recognition of person names with the difference that not every mentioned entity name is an emoter. While, very recently, data with emoter annotations has been made available, no experiments have yet been performed to detect such mentions. With this paper, we provide baseline experiments to understand how challenging the task is. We further evaluate the impact on experiencer-specific emotion categorization and appraisal detection in a pipeline, when gold mentions are not available. We show that experiencer detection in text is a challenging task, with a precision of .82 and a recall of .56 (F1 =.66). These results motivate future work of jointly modeling emoter spans and emotion/appraisal predictions. \nComments:\naccepted to the CPSS workshop at KONVENS\nSubjects:\nComputation and Language (cs.CL)Cite as:\narXiv:2305.16731 [cs.CL] \n(or \narXiv:2305.16731v4 [cs.CL] for this version) \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.16731\nFocus to learn more\nSubmission history\n From: Roman Klinger [\nview email] \n[v1] Fri, 26 May 2023 08:33:28 UTC (28 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 1 Jun 2023 11:32:30 UTC (29 KB)\n[v3] Mon, 24 Jul 2023 11:20:10 UTC (28 KB)\n[v4] Thu, 27 Jul 2023 15:09:38 UTC (28 KB)\nAccess Paper:\nView PDFTeX SourceOther Formatsview license\n Current browse context: \ncs.CL\n< prev  |  \nnext >new \n | recent \n | 2023-05 Change to browse by: \ncsReferences & Citations\nNASA ADSGoogle ScholarSemantic Scholarexport BibTeX citation\nBookmark\n Bibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer \nCode, Data, Media\nDemos\nRelated Papers\n About arXivLabs\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"msapplication-TileColor\": \"#da532c\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"description\": \"Abstract page for arXiv paper 2305.16731: Automatic Emotion Experiencer Recognition\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"arXiv.org\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Automatic Emotion Experiencer Recognition\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16731v4\",\n        \"og:image\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:secure_url\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"1200\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"700\",\n        \"og:image:alt\": \"arXiv logo\",\n        \"og:description\": \"The most prominent subtask in emotion analysis is emotion classification; to assign a category to a textual unit, for instance a social media post.
