Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sentence structure in Tizin is Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n   - The word for oneself in Tizin: \"Pa\" (nominative), \"Mato\" (accusative), \"Sing\" (genitive).\n   - The root verb for an intense like is \"Maktay\" (present), \"Tay\" (preterit past), \"Aktay\" (imperfect past).\n   - The verb \"Maktay\" translates better as \"is pleasing to\".\n   - The word for apples in Tizin: \"Apple\" (nominative), \"Zapple\" (accusative), \"Izapple\" (genitive).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - No specific facts need to be looked up as all necessary information is provided in the request.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The correct form of the verb \"Maktay\" to use in the present tense.\n   - The correct order of words in the sentence \"I like apples\" based on the given sentence structure.\n   - The correct form of \"apples\" to use as the direct object in the sentence.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The sentence \"I like apples\" will likely translate to a form where \"Maktay\" is used in its present tense form, \"Maktay\".\n   - The word \"Zapple\" will likely be used as the direct object since it is in the accusative form.\n   - The word \"Pa\" will likely be used as the subject since it is in the nominative form.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Confirm the sentence structure in Tizin: Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n- Identify the correct verb form for \"like\" in the present tense: \"Maktay\".\n- Determine the correct form of \"apples\" as the direct object: \"Zapple\".\n- Identify the correct form of \"I\" as the subject: \"Pa\".\n- Construct the sentence in Tizin using the identified components.\n- Review the constructed sentence to ensure it follows the given rules and accurately conveys \"I like apples\".\n- Provide the final translation."}
