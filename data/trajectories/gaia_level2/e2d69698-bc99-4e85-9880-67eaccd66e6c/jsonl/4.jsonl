Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking about the US version of Survivor.\n   - The question is specifically about winners of the show.\n   - The birth month of interest is May.\n   - The time frame for the information is as of August 2023.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of all winners of the US version of Survivor.\n   - The birth months of each of these winners.\n   - Sources: Official Survivor website, Wikipedia pages for Survivor seasons and winners, and possibly other reliable entertainment news sites.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the list of winners with their birth months to identify those born in May.\n   - Confirming that there is only one winner born in May.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge of Survivor, there have been several seasons, and it's plausible that at least one winner was born in May.\n   - However, without specific data, it's impossible to guess the exact name or confirm the uniqueness of the May-born winner.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for a comprehensive list of all US Survivor winners.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page or an official Survivor website that lists all the winners and their biographies.\n- **Step 3:** Use WebSurfer to extract the birth months of each winner from their respective biography pages.\n- **Step 4:** Cross-reference the extracted birth months to identify the winner(s) born in May.\n- **Step 5:** Verify that there is only one winner born in May and confirm their name.\n- **Step 6:** Provide the final answer based on the verified information."}

The American series premiered on May 31, 2000, on \nCBS. It is hosted by \nJeff Probst, who is also an \nexecutive producer along with \nMark Burnett and the original creator, Parsons. \nSurvivor places a group of people in an isolated location, where they must provide food, fire, and shelter for themselves. The contestants compete in challenges including testing the contestants' physical abilities like running and swimming or their mental abilities like puzzles and endurance challenges for rewards and \nimmunity from elimination. The contestants are progressively eliminated from the game as they are voted out by their fellow contestants until only two or three remain. At that point, the contestants who were eliminated vote for the winner. They are given the title of \"Sole Survivor\" and are awarded the grand prize of $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 in \nWinners at War). \nThe American version has been very successful. From the \n2000–01 through the \n2005–06 television seasons, its first 11 seasons (competitions) rated among the top 10 most-watched shows. It is commonly considered the leader of American \nreality TV because it was the first \nhighly rated and profitable reality show on \nbroadcast television in the U.S., and is considered one of the best shows of the 2000s (decade).\n[1][2][3] The series has been nominated for 63 \nEmmy Awards, including winning for Outstanding Sound Mixing in 2001, Outstanding Special Class Program in 2002, and was subsequently nominated four times for \nOutstanding Reality-Competition Program when the category was introduced in 2003. Probst won the award for \nOutstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Survivor (American TV series)\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series)\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q28856068\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q28856068\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2007-11-16T16:45:01Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-11T12:12:19Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/400px-Survivor.borneo.logo.png\",\n        \"headline\": \"American version of the international Survivor reality competition television franchise\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/400px-Survivor.borneo.logo.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"400\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Survivor (American TV series) - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Contestants are referred to as \"castaways\", and they compete against one another to become the \"Sole Survivor\" and win one million \nU.S. dollars. First airing in 2000, there currently have been a total of 48 seasons aired. The program itself has been filmed on five continents. \nContestants usually apply to be on the show, but the series has been known to recruit contestants for various seasons. For \nSurvivor: Fiji, the producers had hoped to have a more racially diverse cast, and hoped that a more diverse group would apply after the success of the racially segregated \nSurvivor: Cook Islands. When this did not happen, the producers turned to recruiting and in the end, only one contestant had actually submitted an application to be on the show.\n[1] For the most part, contestants are virtually unknown prior to their \nSurvivor appearance, but occasionally some well-known people are cast. \nA total of 733 participants (castaways) have competed so far (as of \nSurvivor 48). 104 of those participants have competed in multiple seasons: 75 of them have competed in two seasons, 23 have competed in three seasons, six have competed in four seasons, and \nRob Mariano has competed in five seasons of the show. Fifteen seasons have featured or will feature returning players: five with all-returnees (\nSurvivor: All-Stars in 2004, \nSurvivor: Heroes vs. Villains in 2010,\n[2] \nSurvivor: Cambodia in 2015, \nSurvivor: Game Changers in 2017, \nSurvivor: Winners at War in 2020 and the upcoming \nSurvivor 50[3]),\n[4]six with one to four returning players on tribes with new players (\nSurvivor: Guatemala in 2005, \nSurvivor: Redemption Island and \nSurvivor: South Pacific in 2011,\n[5][6] \nSurvivor: Philippines in 2012, \nSurvivor: Edge of Extinction in 2019 and \nSurvivor 45 in 2023),\n[7] two with a tribe of ten returning \"Favorites\" facing off against a tribe of ten \"Fans\" (\nSurvivor: Micronesia in 2008 and \nSurvivor: Caramoan in 2013), and one featuring a tribe of ten returning players playing against a tribe of their family members (\nSurvivor: Blood vs. Water in 2013). Additionally, five contestants (Russell Hantz, Sandra Diaz-Twine, Cirie Fields, Parvati Shallow, Tony Vlachos) have competed on international editions of the series (namily, \nAustralian Survivor, with Fields, Shallow and Vlachos competing on the international cross-over season, \nAustralian Survivor: Australia V The World) \nOn two occasions, contestants have been cast but ultimately withdrew before the game began without being replaced: a 20th contestant, model agency owner Mellisa McNulty, was originally cast in \nSurvivor: Fiji, but dropped out and returned home the night before the show began because of panic attacks,\n[8] while in \nSurvivor: San Juan del Sur, the 19th and 20th contestants, sisters So and Doo Kim, were removed just before filming due to a medical emergency.\n[9] So would later appear on the following season \nSurvivor: Worlds Apart. \nFiji and \nSan Juan del Sur proceeded with an uneven gender balance. But because \nFiji had only one player withdraw, it is the only season in the history of the show to start with an odd number of players.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"List of Survivor (American TV series) contestants\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Survivor_(American_TV_series)_contestants\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6598744\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6598744\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2007-06-15T23:09:24Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-06-29T17:03:41Z\",\n        \"headline\": \"Wikimedia list article\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"List of Survivor (American TV series) contestants - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The show was filmed from March 13 through April 20, 2000, and premiered on May 31, 2000. The season started with 16 participants tasked with being left to survive in a remote area in \nBorneo, Malaysia, with minimal tools and supplies. Hosted by \nJeff Probst, it consisted of 39 days with consecutive participants being removed by a majority vote. The series was set in the \nSouth China Sea on the remote \nMalaysian island of \nPulau Tiga in the state of \nSabah, about six miles (10 km) off the north coast of Borneo.\n[1]The contestants were initially separated into two tribes, Tagi and Pagong, which represented the names of the beaches they were on.\n[1] When 10 players remained, the contestants merged into one tribe, Rattana. While Tagi and Pagong's names and makeups were picked by the producers, Rattana was named by contestants Sean Kenniff and Jenna Lewis, because of the rattan wood that was at their camp. The series was won by \nRichard Hatch defeating Kelly Wiglesworth in a 4–3 jury vote. \nThe finale of the season had an average of 51.7 million viewers, the highest of the franchise. Nielsen reported that 125 million people watched at least some part of the finale.\n[2] In 2006, Hatch was sentenced to 51 months in prison after failing to declare his $1,000,000 winnings.\n[3][4]Overview[edit]\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Survivor: Borneo\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor:_Borneo\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2378208\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2378208\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2003-12-20T05:05:50Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-06-29T03:03:07Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/79/Survivor_borneo_first_season_dvd_region_1.png\",\n        \"headline\": \"season of television series\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/79/Survivor_borneo_first_season_dvd_region_1.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"908\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Survivor: Borneo - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
