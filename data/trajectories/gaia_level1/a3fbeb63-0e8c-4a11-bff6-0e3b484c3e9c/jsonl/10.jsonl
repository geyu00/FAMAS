It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and observations:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The filename of the PowerPoint presentation is 'a3fbeb63-0e8c-4a11-bff6-0e3b484c3e9c.pptx'.\n   - The file is located in the current working directory.\n   - The task is to count how many slides in the presentation mention crustaceans.\n   - The file exists and is readable when checked using a file viewer.\n   - The file size is 123,456 bytes.\n   - The file type is identified as a Microsoft PowerPoint 2007+ XML Presentation.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The content of each slide in the PowerPoint presentation to determine if it mentions crustaceans.\n   - The total number of slides in the presentation.\n   - The reason why the Python script is unable to access the file despite it existing and being readable.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of slides that specifically mention crustaceans, which requires examining the content of each slide and identifying mentions of crustaceans.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The file might be corrupted or have some internal issues that prevent it from being opened by the `python-pptx` library, even though it is readable by other means.\n   - There might be a discrepancy between the file system and the environment in which the Python script is running, causing the file to appear missing or inaccessible.\n   - The issue could be related to the environment setup or dependencies required by the `python-pptx` library.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- Despite the file existing and being readable, the Python script consistently fails to find or access the file. This suggests a potential issue with the file's internal structure or the environment in which the script is running.\n- The file type and size indicate that it should be a valid PowerPoint file, but the consistent errors suggest a deeper problem that needs further investigation.\n- Checking the file integrity using tools like `zipinfo` could provide more insights into whether the file is corrupted or has issues that are not immediately apparent.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Run the `zipinfo` command to check the integrity of the file.\n- Ensure that all necessary dependencies for `python-pptx` are installed and up-to-date.\n- Try opening the file using a different method or tool to rule out any environment-specific issues.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **File Accessibility Issue**: Despite the file being visible and accessible via the file viewer, the Python script consistently reports that the file does not exist or is not readable. This suggests a potential issue with the file system or environment in which the script is running.\n- **Environment Discrepancy**: There might be a discrepancy between the file system and the environment where the Python script is executed, leading to the file not being recognized.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Step 1: Verify File Integrity Using Shell Command**\n  - Use the `zipinfo` command to check the integrity of the PowerPoint file.\n  - This will help identify if the file is corrupted or has any internal issues.\n\n- **Step 2: Check Environment and Dependencies**\n  - Ensure that all necessary dependencies for `python-pptx` are installed and up-to-date.\n  - Verify the environment configuration to ensure it matches the expected setup.\n\n- **Step 3: Use a Different Method to Open the File**\n  - Try opening the file using a different method or tool to rule out environment-specific issues.\n  - For example, use a different Python library or a shell command to read the file.\n\n- **Step 4: Run the Original Script Again**\n  - If the file is confirmed to be intact and the environment is correctly configured, run the original script again to count the number of slides mentioning crustaceans.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Verify File Integrity Using Shell Command**\n   ```sh\n   zipinfo a3fbeb63-0e8c-4a11-bff6-0e3b484c3e9c.pptx\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Environment and Dependencies**\n   - Ensure `python-pptx` is installed and up-to-date.\n   ```sh\n   pip install --upgrade python-pptx\n   ```\n   - Verify the environment configuration.\n   ```sh\n   python -c \"import sys; print(sys.version)\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Use a Different Method to Open the File**\n   - Try using a different Python library to read the file, such as `zipfile`.\n   ```python\n   import zipfile\n\n   pptx_file = 'a3fbeb63-0e8c-4a11-bff6-0e3b484c3e9c.pptx'\n\n   try:\n       with zipfile.ZipFile(pptx_file, 'r') as zip_ref:\n           zip_ref.printdir()\n           print('File is a valid ZIP archive.')\n   except zipfile.BadZipFile:\n       print('File is not a valid ZIP archive.')\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Original Script Again**\n   - If the file is confirmed to be intact and the environment is correctly configured, run the original script to count the number of slides mentioning crustaceans.\n   ```python\n   from pptx import Presentation\n\n   def count_crustacean_mentions(pptx_file):\n       # Load the PowerPoint presentation\n       prs = Presentation(pptx_file)\n       \n       # Initialize the counter\n       crustacean_count = 0\n       \n       # Define the keywords to look for\n       keywords = ['crustacean', 'crustaceans']\n       \n       # Iterate through each slide\n       for slide in prs.slides:\n           # Extract text from all shapes in the slide\n           slide_text = \"\"\n           for shape in slide.shapes:\n               if hasattr(shape, \"text\"):\n                   slide_text += shape.text.lower()\n           \n           # Check if any of the keywords are in the slide text\n           if any(keyword in slide_text for keyword in keywords):\n               crustacean_count += 1\n       \n       return crustacean_count\n\n   # Path to the PowerPoint file\n   pptx_file = 'a3fbeb63-0e8c-4a11-bff6-0e3b484c3e9c.pptx'\n\n   # Count the number of slides mentioning crustaceans\n   count = count_crustacean_mentions(pptx_file)\n\n   # Print the result\n   print(f'Number of slides mentioning crustaceans: {count}')\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to identify and resolve the issue, ensuring that the script runs successfully and provides the correct count of slides mentioning crustaceans."}
