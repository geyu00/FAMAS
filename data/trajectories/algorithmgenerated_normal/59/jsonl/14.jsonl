Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nFind out how many papers by an author named Yuri were accepted with a \"certain\" recommendation at the NeurIPS 2022 Conference according to Openreview.net.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Use Selenium to handle dynamic content loading and extract the list of accepted papers from the NeurIPS 2022 Conference on Openreview.net.\n2. Filter the papers to find those authored by someone named Yuri.\n3. Check the recommendation status of these papers to see if they were accepted with a \"certain\" recommendation.\n4. Count the number of such papers.\n\n## Output format\nThe number of papers by an author named Yuri that were accepted with a \"certain\" recommendation.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure the data is extracted accurately from Openreview.net.\n- Verify that the author name matches exactly \"Yuri\".\n- Confirm the recommendation status is \"certain\".\n- Provide the final count of such papers.\n\n## Results from last response\nThe previous attempts to use Selenium for scraping the data from Openreview.net were unsuccessful due to WebDriver setup issues. The errors were primarily due to incorrect initialization parameters for the WebDriver and missing modules.\n\n## Additional information (file path, code blocks, url, etc.)\nScript provided for data extraction:\n```python\n# filename: extract_neurips_2022_papers.py\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nimport time\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Provide path to chromedriver executable\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome('/path/to/chromedriver')\n\n# Open the NeurIPS 2022 conference page on Openreview.net\ndriver.get('https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2022/Conference')\n\n# Allow the page to load fully\ntime.sleep(10)\n\n# Load more papers if necessary (this step depends on the website's structure)\n# Example: Click a 'Load more' button if available\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        load_more_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//button[text()=\"Show More\"]')\n        load_more_button.click()\n        time.sleep(5)\n    except:\n        break\n\n# Extract paper information (titles, authors, recommendations)\npapers = []\npaper_elements = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, 'note')\nfor paper in paper_elements:\n    title = paper.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, 'title').text\n    authors = paper.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, 'authors').text\n    recommendation = paper.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, 'recommendation').text\n    papers.append({\n        'title': title,\n        'authors': authors,\n        'recommendation': recommendation\n    })\n\n# Close the WebDriver\ndriver.quit()\n\n# Convert the list of papers to a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(papers)\n\n# Save the DataFrame to a CSV file\ndf.to_csv('neurips_2022_papers.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(\"Data extraction complete.
