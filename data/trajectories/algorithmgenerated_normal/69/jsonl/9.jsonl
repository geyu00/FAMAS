{"agent": "VideoContentAnalysis_Expert", "content": "It seems that the download attempts are still failing due to the same YouTube restrictions. Since we cannot bypass these restrictions directly in our current environment, I recommend a different strategy:\n\n1. **Manual Download:** You may need to download the video manually from YouTube, ensuring you are signed in, and save it to a known location on your system.\n\n2. **Transcription:** Once you have the video downloaded, you can provide me with the file path or transfer it here. I can then assist with extracting the audio and transcribing Teal'c's response.\n\nAlternatively, if you have any other approach or tool you would like to try, please let me know, and we can explore that direction."}
