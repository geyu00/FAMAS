Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The artist in question is the \"King of Pop,\" which refers to Michael Jackson.\n   - We are looking for the last word before the second chorus.\n   - The song in question is the fifth single from Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The title of Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.\n   - The list of singles from that album, specifically the fifth single.\n   - The lyrics of the fifth single, particularly the section leading up to the second chorus.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n     - Michael Jackson's discography on official music websites, fan sites, or music databases like AllMusic.\n     - Lyrics can be found on lyric websites like Genius or Musixmatch.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify the exact point in the song where the second chorus begins.\n   - Determine the last word in the verse or bridge immediately preceding the second chorus.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Michael Jackson's sixth studio album is likely \"Bad\" (1987), as it is one of his most famous and well-documented albums.\n   - The fifth single from \"Bad\" is likely \"Smooth Criminal,\" but this needs verification.\n   - The structure of \"Smooth Criminal\" is well-known, but the specific word before the second chorus would need to be confirmed by examining the lyrics.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify Michael Jackson's Sixth Studio Album:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Search for \"Michael Jackson's discography\" to identify his sixth studio album.\n  \n- **Determine the Fifth Single from the Sixth Studio Album:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Once the sixth studio album is identified, search for the list of singles from that album to find the fifth single.\n\n- **Find the Lyrics of the Fifth Single:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Search for the lyrics of the identified fifth single, focusing on the section leading up to the second chorus.\n\n- **Locate the Last Word Before the Second Chorus:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Analyze the lyrics to pinpoint the exact location of the second chorus and identify the last word before it.\n\n- **Verify and Report the Result:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Confirm the findings and report the last word before the second chorus."}

It was released on August 31, 1987, by \nEpic Records. Written and recorded between 1985 and 1987, \nBad was Jackson's third and final collaboration with the producer \nQuincy Jones. Jackson adopted a more aggressive sound for the album, departing from his signature \ngroove-based style and falsetto. Primarily featuring \npop, \ndance, and \nR&B, as well as elements of \nfunk, \nsoul, \njazz, \nrock, and \nhard rock, \nBad incorporated new recording technology, including \ndigital synthesizers. Jackson co-produced and composed all but two tracks, and the lyrical themes include \nself-improvement, \nromance, \nworld peace, \nmedia bias, \nparanoia, and \nracial profiling. The album features appearances from \nSiedah Garrett and \nStevie Wonder. \nReleased nearly five years after Jackson's previous album, \nThriller (1982), anticipation for \nBad was high. Prior to the release of the album, Jackson reinvented himself, which was widely discussed in the media. The film \nMoonwalker (1988), which included the music videos for several \nBad songs, was used to promote the album. Jackson also embarked on his first \nsolo world tour, performing 123 concerts across 15 countries for his Bad tour, attracting 4.4 million people as the tour grossed $125 million (equivalent to $317 million in 2024), making it the second \nhighest-grossing concert tour ever at the time. Nine singles (and a \npromotional single, ''\nSpeed Demon'')\n[5] were released to promote the album. \nBad sold more than 2.25 million copies in its first week in the US as it reached number one on the \nBillboard Top Pop Albums chart. Whilst ultimately failing to replicate the pandemonium of \nThriller in the US, the album produced a \nrecord-breaking five US number ones, \"\nI Just Can't Stop Loving You\", \"\nBad\", \"\nThe Way You Make Me Feel\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Bad (album)\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_(album)\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q44142\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q44142\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2004-04-10T02:06:10Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-12T21:22:23Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/Michael_Jackson_-_Bad.png\",\n        \"headline\": \"1987 studio album by Michael Jackson\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/Michael_Jackson_-_Bad.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"640\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Bad (album) - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The album was an enormous success internationally; it reached number one in 24 other countries and was the best-selling album globally of both 1987 and 1988. It received positive reviews, particularly for Jackson's vocals and the more sophisticated production. Retrospectively, it has been acclaimed as a staple of 1980s \npopular music, solidifying Jackson's status as a global superstar and being an extension of his influence on contemporary music. \nBad is one of the \nbest-selling albums of all time having sold over 35 million copies worldwide and is certified \n11× platinum in the US. It has been ranked in lists of the greatest albums of all time; some critics have noted aspects of the album, particularly the songwriting and pop sentiments, as being the best of Jackson's career. The album was nominated for six \nGrammy Awards, including \nAlbum of the Year. It won \nBest Engineered Recording – Non Classical and \nBest Music Video (for \"Leave Me Alone\"). \"Bad\" won an \nAmerican Music Award for \nFavorite Soul/R&B Song. Jackson also received several special awards in recognition of the album's success. In 2012, an expanded reissue album, \nBad 25, and a documentary film also titled \nBad 25 were released to celebrate the album's 25th anniversary. \nBackground[edit]Jackson's \nBad jacket on display at the Hollywood \nGuinness World Records Museum\nBy 1984, Jackson's sixth solo album, \nThriller (1982), had been certified \n20× platinum for sales of 20 million copies in the United States alone.\n[6] Jackson was considered the most powerful African American in the history of the entertainment industry,\n[7] whose popularity was comparable only to \nElvis Presley in the 1950s and \nthe Beatles in the 1960s.\n[8] The years following were marred by Jackson's rifts with \nhis family and the \nJehovah's Witnesses, broken friendships with celebrities, and the pressure of celebrity.\n[2] He spent 1985 out of the public eye,\n[7] but remained in the press due to eccentric behavior, including the adoption of \nBubbles the chimpanzee.\n[9] Other rumors were false; this included the rumor that Jackson slept in a \nhyperbaric chamber.\n[9]According to some associates, Jackson was nervous about completing his next album.\n[2] \nKen Tucker of \nNPR Music claimed that there was almost no chance of Jackson's follow-up to \nThriller selling as many records as \nThriller did, and that the level of mass pop phenomenon experienced by Jackson during the \nThriller era was unlikely to occur again.\n[10] In 2017, \nNewsweek wrote that following\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
