{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "To double-check the results, I will verify the proximity of the identified restaurants to Washington Square Park and ensure that they indeed offer vegan main dishes priced under $15. \n\nLet's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify the proximity**: Ensure that each restaurant is indeed within 1 block of Washington Square Park.\n2. **Check the menus**: Confirm that each restaurant has vegan main dishes available for under $15.\n\nI'll use a systematic approach to verify this information:\n\n### Verification Plan\n1. Cross-check the addresses of the restaurants against a map to validate their proximity to Washington Square Park.\n2. Look up each restaurant’s current menu online to confirm the presence and pricing of vegan main dishes.\n\n### Results Validation Code (Python)\nTo ensure accuracy in our verification, I'll create a Python code snippet that can fetch restaurant data including their menu and pricing (assuming we have access to an appropriate API or data source for restaurant menus). For our immediate verification, I'll just provide the code and manually validate.\n\nHere is a code snippet that can be used if we had the appropriate environment setup:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# List of restaurants and their addresses\nrestaurants = [\n    {\"name\": \"By Chloe\", \"address\": \"185 Bleecker Street, New York, NY 10012\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Saigon Shack\", \"address\": \"114 MacDougal Street, New York, NY 10012\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Greenwich Village Bistro\", \"address\": \"13 Carmine Street, New York, NY 10014\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Peacefood Cafe\", \"address\": \"41 E 11th Street, New York, NY 10003\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Murray's Falafel & Grill\", \"address\": \"261 6th Avenue, New York, NY 10014\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Mamouns Falafel\", \"address\": \"119 MacDougal Street, New York, NY 10012\"},\n]\n\n# Function to check vegan main dishes\ndef check_vegan_menu(restaurant):\n    # Placeholder for API call or manual search\n    # Assume we get the menu as a list of dishes with prices\n    menu = fetch_menu(restaurant[\"address\"])  # This would be an actual API call\n    vegan_dishes = [dish for dish in menu if dish['type'] == 'vegan' and dish['price'] < 15]\n    return len(vegan_dishes) > 0  # True if there's at least one vegan dish under $15\n\n# Verify each restaurant\nverified_restaurants = []\nfor restaurant in restaurants:\n    if check_vegan_menu(restaurant):\n        verified_restaurants.append(restaurant)\n\nprint(\"Verified Restaurants with Vegan Mains Under $15:\")\nfor restaurant in verified_restaurants:\n    print(f\"{restaurant['name']} - {restaurant['address']}\")\n```\n\nSince we can't run this code to check the menu directly, I suggest manually verifying the menus for the listed restaurants. \n\nCould the Vegan Food Expert assist in verifying this information to confirm the current status of the vegan dishes and their prices?"}
