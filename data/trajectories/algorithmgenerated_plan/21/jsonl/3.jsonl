{"agent": "Lyrics_Expert", "content": "Let's proceed step by step following the plan.\n\n1. **Confirm that \"Thriller\" is the fifth single from Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.**\n   - Michael Jackson's sixth studio album is \"Thriller,\" released in 1982. The singles from this album are: \n     1. \"The Girl Is Mine\"\n     2. \"Billie Jean\"\n     3. \"Beat It\"\n     4. \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\"\n     5. \"Thriller\"\n\n   This confirms that \"Thriller\" is indeed the fifth single from his sixth studio album.\n\n2. **Analyze the lyrics of the song \"Thriller\" to locate the second chorus.**\n   - The song \"Thriller\" features a notable structure with verses leading into choruses. I'll extract the relevant portion of the lyrics to identify the second chorus.\n\n3. **Identify the last word before the second chorus.**\n   - Upon reviewing the lyrics of \"Thriller,\" the second chorus typically follows a verse. The last word before this chorus will be crucial in answering the question.\n\nNow, I'll extract the lyrics and find the specific word. \n\nFor verification, I will proceed with a coded approach to ensure accurate results.
