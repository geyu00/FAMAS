{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must feature Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDB ratings for Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has several critically acclaimed films, but without looking up the specific ratings and runtimes, it's difficult to guess which one would be the highest-rated and meet all the criteria. However, films like \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) and \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) are known for their high critical acclaim and could be potential candidates.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to search for a list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on IMDB.\n- **Step 2**: Use WebSurfer to filter the list to include only films with a runtime of less than 2 hours.\n- **Step 3**: Use WebSurfer to note the IMDB ratings for these filtered films.\n- **Step 4**: Use WebSurfer to check the availability of these films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n- **Step 5**: Identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n- **Step 6**: Provide the title and relevant details of the identified film."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must feature Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDB ratings for Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has several critically acclaimed films, but without looking up the specific ratings and runtimes, it's difficult to guess which one would be the highest-rated and meet all the criteria. However, films like \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) and \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) are known for their high critical acclaim and could be potential candidates.\n   - Based on the IMDb page, \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) has a high rating of 7.2 and is likely to be less than 2 hours long. \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) also has a high rating of 7.3 and is a strong candidate. Both films are critically acclaimed and could potentially meet the runtime and availability criteria.\n   - Another potential candidate is \"Possession\" (1981), which has a rating of 7.3 and is known for its critical acclaim. It is worth checking if this film meets the runtime and availability criteria as well.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) and \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) are both highly rated and are known for their critical success. They are likely to be less than 2 hours long and are strong candidates for meeting the criteria.\n- \"Possession\" (1981) is another highly rated film with a similar rating to \"Camille Claudel\" and is also critically acclaimed. It is worth checking if it meets the runtime and availability criteria.\n\nNext steps:\n- Use WebSurfer to search for the specific IMDB ratings and runtimes of \"The Story of Adele H.,\" \"Camille Claudel,\" and \"Possession.\"\n- Check the availability of these films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure\n\n1. **Incomplete Data Extraction**: We did not successfully extract the necessary data (titles, ratings, and runtimes) from Isabelle Adjani's IMDb page. This was due to not scrolling far enough or not focusing on the correct sections of the page.\n2. **Lack of Systematic Approach**: We did not have a clear, step-by-step plan to ensure we captured all the required information.\n3. **Verification of Availability**: We did not verify the availability of the films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) after identifying the potential candidates.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb page: [Isabelle Adjani - IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/).\n\n2. **Scroll to the Filmography Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the \"Filmography\" section to view the list of her films.\n\n3. **Extract Film Titles, Ratings, and Runtimes**:\n   - Extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Focus on films that are less than 2 hours long.\n\n4. **Filter and List Potential Candidates**:\n   - Create a list of films that meet the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime).\n\n5. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - For each film in the list, use WebSurfer to check if it is available on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) to buy or rent.\n   - Note the availability status for each film.\n\n6. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - From the list of films that meet all the criteria, identify the highest-rated film.\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Provide the title and relevant details of the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb Page**:\n   - Open the web browser and navigate to [Isabelle Adjani - IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/).\n\n2. **Scroll to the Filmography Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the \"Filmography\" section to view the list of her films.\n\n3. **Extract Film Titles, Ratings, and Runtimes**:\n   - Scroll through the filmography section and extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Ensure to focus on films that are less than 2 hours long.\n\n4. **Filter and List Potential Candidates**:\n   - Create a list of films that meet the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime).\n\n5. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - For each film in the list, use WebSurfer to search for the film on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n   - Note the availability status for each film.\n\n6. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - From the list of films that meet all the criteria, identify the highest-rated film.\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Provide the title and relevant details of the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n### Example Commands\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb Page**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.open(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Scroll to the Filmography Section**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.scrollDown(3)\n   ```\n\n3. **Extract Film Titles, Ratings, and Runtimes**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.extractText(\".filmo-row\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Filter and List Potential Candidates**:\n   ```python\n   films = [\n       {\"title\": \"The Story of Adele H.\", \"rating\": 7.2, \"runtime\": \"115 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"Camille Claudel\", \"rating\": 7.3, \"runtime\": \"145 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"Possession\", \"rating\": 7.3, \"runtime\": \"117 min\"}\n   ]\n   filtered_films = [film for film in films if int(film[\"runtime\"].split()[0]) < 120]\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   ```sh\n   for film in filtered_films:\n       WebSurfer.search(f\"{film['title']} Fandango at Home\")\n       availability = WebSurfer.extractText(\".buy-rent-buttons\")\n       film[\"available\"] = \"Yes\" if \"Buy\" in availability or \"Rent\" in availability else \"No\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   ```python\n   highest_rated_film = max(filtered_films, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n   ```\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   ```sh\n   print(f\"The highest-rated film is {highest_rated_film['title']} with a rating of {highest_rated_film['rating']} and a runtime of {highest_rated_film['runtime']}.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must feature Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDB ratings for Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has several critically acclaimed films, but without looking up the specific ratings and runtimes, it's difficult to guess which one would be the highest-rated and meet all the criteria. However, films like \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975), \"Camille Claudel\" (1988), and \"Possession\" (1981) are known for their high critical acclaim and could be potential candidates.\n   - Based on the IMDb page, \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) has a high rating of 7.2 and is likely to be less than 2 hours long. \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) also has a high rating of 7.3 and is a strong candidate. Both films are critically acclaimed and could potentially meet the runtime and availability criteria.\n   - \"Possession\" (1981) has a rating of 7.3 and is known for its critical acclaim. It is worth checking if this film meets the runtime and availability criteria as well.\n   - Other films like \"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht\" (1979) with a rating of 7.4 and \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) with a rating of 7.6 are also highly rated and should be considered.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) and \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) are both highly rated and are known for their critical success. They are likely to be less than 2 hours long and are strong candidates for meeting the criteria.\n- \"Possession\" (1981) is another highly rated film with a similar rating to \"Camille Claudel\" and is also critically acclaimed. It is worth checking if it meets the runtime and availability criteria.\n- \"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht\" (1979) and \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) are also highly rated and should be included in the list of potential candidates to ensure we do not miss any high-rated films.\n\nNext steps:\n- Use WebSurfer to search for the specific IMDB ratings and runtimes of \"The Story of Adele H.,\" \"Camille Claudel,\" \"Possession,\" \"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht,\" and \"La Reine Margot.\"\n- Check the availability of these films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb Page**:\n   - Open the web browser and navigate to [Isabelle Adjani - IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/).\n\n2. **Scroll to the Filmography Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the \"Filmography\" section to view the list of her films.\n\n3. **Extract Film Titles, Ratings, and Runtimes**:\n   - Extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Focus on films that are less than 2 hours long.\n\n4. **Filter and List Potential Candidates**:\n   - Create a list of films that meet the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime).\n\n5. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - For each film in the list, use WebSurfer to check if it is available on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) to buy or rent.\n   - Note the availability status for each film.\n\n6. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - From the list of films that meet all the criteria, identify the highest-rated film.\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Provide the title and relevant details of the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n### Example Commands\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb Page**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.open(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Scroll to the Filmography Section**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.scrollDown(5)\n   ```\n\n3. **Extract Film Titles, Ratings, and Runtimes**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.extractText(\".filmo-row\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Filter and List Potential Candidates**:\n   ```python\n   films = [\n       {\"title\": \"The Story of Adele H.\", \"rating\": 7.2, \"runtime\": \"115 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"Camille Claudel\", \"rating\": 7.3, \"runtime\": \"145 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"Possession\", \"rating\": 7.3, \"runtime\": \"117 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht\", \"rating\": 7.4, \"runtime\": \"120 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"La Reine Margot\", \"rating\": 7.6, \"runtime\": \"150 min\"}\n   ]\n   filtered_films = [film for film in films if int(film[\"runtime\"].split()[0]) < 120]\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   ```sh\n   for film in filtered_films:\n       WebSurfer.search(f\"{film['title']} Fandango at Home\")\n       availability = WebSurfer.extractText(\".buy-rent-buttons\")\n       film[\"available\"] = \"Yes\" if \"Buy\" in availability or \"Rent\" in availability else \"No\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   ```python\n   highest_rated_film = max(filtered_films, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n   ```\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   ```sh\n   print(f\"The highest-rated film is {highest_rated_film['title']} with a rating of {highest_rated_film['rating']} and a runtime of {highest_rated_film['runtime']}. It is available on Fandango at Home: {highest_rated_film['available']}\")\n   ```\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure\n\n1. **Inconsistent Scrolling**: The WebSurfer did not consistently scroll to the 'Filmography' section, leading to incomplete data extraction.\n2. **Data Extraction Issues**: The extraction commands did not target the correct elements, resulting in missing or incorrect data.\n3. **Lack of Verification**: There was no verification step to ensure that the extracted data was complete and accurate before proceeding to the next steps.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to open the IMDb page for Isabelle Adjani.\n   - Ensure the page is fully loaded before proceeding.\n\n2. **Scroll to the Filmography Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the 'Filmography' section to ensure all relevant films are visible.\n   - Verify that the 'Filmography' section is in the viewport.\n\n3. **Extract Film Titles, Ratings, and Runtimes**:\n   - Extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Focus on films that are less than 2 hours long.\n\n4. **Filter and List Potential Candidates**:\n   - Create a list of films that meet the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime).\n\n5. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - For each film in the list, use WebSurfer to check if it is available on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) to buy or rent.\n   - Note the availability status for each film.\n\n6. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - From the list of films that meet all the criteria, identify the highest-rated film.\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Provide the title and relevant details of the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb Page**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.open(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Scroll to the Filmography Section**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.scrollDown(5)\n   ```\n\n3. **Extract Film Titles, Ratings, and Runtimes**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.extractText(\".filmo-row\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Filter and List Potential Candidates**:\n   ```python\n   films = [\n       {\"title\": \"The Story of Adele H.\", \"rating\": 7.2, \"runtime\": \"115 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"Camille Claudel\", \"rating\": 7.3, \"runtime\": \"145 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"Possession\", \"rating\": 7.3, \"runtime\": \"117 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht\", \"rating\": 7.4, \"runtime\": \"120 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"La Reine Margot\", \"rating\": 7.6, \"runtime\": \"150 min\"}\n   ]\n   filtered_films = [film for film in films if int(film[\"runtime\"].split()[0]) < 120]\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   ```sh\n   for film in filtered_films:\n       WebSurfer.search(f\"{film['title']} Fandango at Home\")\n       availability = WebSurfer.extractText(\".buy-rent-buttons\")\n       film[\"available\"] = \"Yes\" if \"Buy\" in availability or \"Rent\" in availability else \"No\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   ```python\n   highest_rated_film = max(filtered_films, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n   ```\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   ```sh\n   print(f\"The highest-rated film is {highest_rated_film['title']} with a rating of {highest_rated_film['rating']} and a runtime of {highest_rated_film['runtime']}.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must feature Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDB ratings for Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has several critically acclaimed films, but without looking up the specific ratings and runtimes, it's difficult to guess which one would be the highest-rated and meet all the criteria. However, films like \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975), \"Camille Claudel\" (1988), and \"Possession\" (1981) are known for their high critical acclaim and could be potential candidates.\n   - Based on the IMDb page, \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) has a high rating of 7.2 and is likely to be less than 2 hours long. \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) also has a high rating of 7.3 and is a strong candidate. Both films are critically acclaimed and could potentially meet the runtime and availability criteria.\n   - \"Possession\" (1981) has a rating of 7.3 and is known for its critical acclaim. It is worth checking if this film meets the runtime and availability criteria as well.\n   - \"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht\" (1979) with a rating of 7.4 and \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) with a rating of 7.6 are also highly rated and should be considered.\n   - \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) is a particularly strong candidate due to its high rating of 7.6, but its runtime needs to be verified as it is known to be longer.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- \"The Story of Adele H.\" (1975) and \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) are both highly rated and are known for their critical success. They are likely to be less than 2 hours long and are strong candidates for meeting the criteria.\n- \"Possession\" (1981) is another highly rated film with a similar rating to \"Camille Claudel\" and is also critically acclaimed. It is worth checking if it meets the runtime and availability criteria.\n- \"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht\" (1979) and \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) are also highly rated and should be included in the list of potential candidates to ensure we do not miss any high-rated films. \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) is particularly strong due to its high rating of 7.6, but its runtime needs to be verified.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb Page**:\n   - Open the web browser and navigate to [Isabelle Adjani - IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/).\n\n2. **Scroll to the Filmography Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the \"Filmography\" section to view the list of her films.\n\n3. **Extract Film Titles, Ratings, and Runtimes**:\n   - Extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Focus on films that are less than 2 hours long.\n\n4. **Filter and List Potential Candidates**:\n   - Create a list of films that meet the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime).\n\n5. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - For each film in the list, use WebSurfer to check if it is available on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) to buy or rent.\n   - Note the availability status for each film.\n\n6. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - From the list of films that meet all the criteria, identify the highest-rated film.\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Provide the title and relevant details of the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb Page**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.open(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Scroll to the Filmography Section**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.scrollDown(5)\n   ```\n\n3. **Extract Film Titles, Ratings, and Runtimes**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.extractText(\".filmo-row\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Filter and List Potential Candidates**:\n   ```python\n   films = [\n       {\"title\": \"The Story of Adele H.\", \"rating\": 7.2, \"runtime\": \"115 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"Camille Claudel\", \"rating\": 7.3, \"runtime\": \"145 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"Possession\", \"rating\": 7.3, \"runtime\": \"117 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht\", \"rating\": 7.4, \"runtime\": \"120 min\"},\n       {\"title\": \"La Reine Margot\", \"rating\": 7.6, \"runtime\": \"150 min\"}\n   ]\n   filtered_films = [film for film in films if int(film[\"runtime\"].split()[0]) < 120]\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   ```sh\n   for film in filtered_films:\n       WebSurfer.search(f\"{film['title']} Fandango at Home\")\n       availability = WebSurfer.extractText(\".buy-rent-buttons\")\n       film[\"available\"] = \"Yes\" if \"Buy\" in availability or \"Rent\" in availability else \"No\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   ```python\n   highest_rated_film = max(filtered_films, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n   ```\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   ```sh\n   print(f\"The highest-rated film is {highest_rated_film['title']} with a rating of {highest_rated_film['rating']} and a runtime of {highest_rated_film['runtime']}. It is available on Fandango at Home: {highest_rated_film['available']}\")\n   ```\n\n### Additional Hints\n\n- **Ensure Full Page Load**: Before extracting data, ensure the page is fully loaded by using `WebSurfer.sleep(5)` to wait for 5 seconds.\n- **Verify Extraction**: After extracting data, print the extracted data to the console to verify its accuracy.\n- **Scroll Incrementally**: If the 'Filmography' section is not visible, scroll incrementally and check the viewport after each scroll.\n- **Use Specific Selectors**: Use specific CSS selectors to target the exact elements containing the film titles, ratings, and runtimes.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step: navigating to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb page and scrolling to the 'Filmography' section.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inconsistent Scrolling**: The WebSurfer did not consistently scroll to the 'Filmography' section, leading to incomplete data extraction.\n2. **Data Extraction Issues**: The extraction commands did not target the correct elements, resulting in missing or incorrect data.\n3. **Lack of Verification**: There was no verification step to ensure that the extracted data was complete and accurate before proceeding to the next steps.\n4. **Manual Scrolling**: The manual scrolling approach was not effective in ensuring that all relevant data was visible and extractable.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to open the IMDb page for Isabelle Adjani.\n   - Ensure the page is fully loaded before proceeding.\n   - **Command**:\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.open(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/\")\n     WebSurfer.sleep(5)\n     ```\n\n2. **Scroll to the Filmography Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the 'Filmography' section to ensure all relevant films are visible.\n   - Verify that the 'Filmography' section is in the viewport.\n   - **Command**:\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.scrollDown(5)\n     WebSurfer.sleep(2)\n     ```\n\n3. **Extract Film Titles, Ratings, and Runtimes**:\n   - Extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Focus on films that are less than 2 hours long.\n   - **Command**:\n     ```sh\n     filmography_text = WebSurfer.extractText(\".filmo-row\")\n     print(filmography_text)\n     ```\n\n4. **Parse Extracted Data**:\n   - Use Python to parse the extracted text and create a list of films with their titles, ratings, and runtimes.\n   - Filter the list to include only films that are less than 2 hours long.\n   - **Command**:\n     ```python\n     import re\n\n     # Sample extracted text (for demonstration purposes)\n     filmography_text = \"\"\"\n     1975 L'histoire d'Adèle H. 7.2 115 min\n     1981 Possession 7.3 117 min\n     1988 Camille Claudel 7.3 145 min\n     1979 Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht 7.4 120 min\n     1994 La Reine Margot 7.6 150 min\n     \"\"\"\n\n     # Parse the text\n     films = []\n     for line in filmography_text.strip().split('\\n'):\n         parts = line.split()\n         year = parts[0]\n         title = ' '.join(parts[1:-2])\n         rating = float(parts[-2])\n         runtime = int(parts[-1].replace('min', ''))\n         films.append({\"title\": title, \"rating\": rating, \"runtime\": runtime})\n\n     # Filter films\n     filtered_films = [film for film in films if film[\"runtime\"] < 120]\n     print(filtered_films)\n     ```\n\n5. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - For each film in the filtered list, use WebSurfer to check if it is available on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) to buy or rent.\n   - Note the availability status for each film.\n   - **Command**:\n     ```sh\n     for film in filtered_films:\n         WebSurfer.search(f\"{film['title']} Fandango at Home\")\n         WebSurfer.sleep(2)\n         availability = WebSurfer.extractText(\".buy-rent-buttons\")\n         film[\"available\"] = \"Yes\" if \"Buy\" in availability or \"Rent\" in availability else \"No\"\n     ```\n\n6. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - From the list of films that meet all the criteria, identify the highest-rated film.\n   - **Command**:\n     ```python\n     highest_rated_film = max(filtered_films, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n     print(highest_rated_film)\n     ```\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Provide the title and relevant details of the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n   - **Command**:\n     ```sh\n     print(f\"The highest-rated film is {highest_rated_film['title']} with a rating of {highest_rated_film['rating']} and a runtime of {highest_rated_film['runtime']} minutes.
