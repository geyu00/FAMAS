{"agent": "Grocery_Expert", "content": "To proceed with verifying the provided information about the supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago offering ready-to-eat salads for under $15, I will take the following steps:\n\n1. **Verification of Menards**: I will check if Menards is classified as a supermarket and confirm its availability of ready-to-eat salads.\n2. **Confirmation of Whole Foods Market**: I will verify the details regarding the ready-to-eat salads and their prices.\n3. **Confirmation of Costco**: I will also verify the details for Costco regarding the ready-to-eat salads and their pricing.\n\nLet's start with checking Menards first. I'll look into its classification and product offerings.\n\n### Step 1: Verify Menards\nI will check for information regarding Menards and its salad offerings to ensure it qualifies as a supermarket for this analysis. \n\n### Step 2: Verify Whole Foods Market\nThen, I will check to confirm the details about Whole Foods Market, specifically regarding the pricing of their ready-to-eat salads.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Costco\nFinally, I will confirm the product offerings and pricing for Costco.\n\nLet's gather the information systematically. \n\nFirst, I will look for Menards classification and salad offerings. \n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Function to check if Menards offers ready-to-eat salads\ndef check_menards_salads():\n    url = \"https://www.menards.com/main/grocery/salads/c-1645826968.htm\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n    \n    # Scraping the items available in the salads section\n    salad_items = []\n    for item in soup.find_all('div', class_='product-title'):\n        salad_items.append(item.text.strip())\n    \n    return salad_items\n\nmenards_salads = check_menards_salads()\nmenards_salads\n```\n\nNow, I'll execute the code above using the Computer_terminal to check Menards for the ready-to-eat salads."}
