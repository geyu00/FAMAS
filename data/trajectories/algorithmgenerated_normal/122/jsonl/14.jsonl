{"agent": "Accessibility_Expert", "content": "To begin, I will confirm the exact address of the Mummers Museum, which is 1100 S 2nd Street, Philadelphia, PA 19147. \n\nNext, I will assess the wheelchair accessibility of the identified bars: \n- Grace and Proper\n- 2nd Street Brew House\n- O'Jung's Tavern Bar\n- Garage Passyunk\n\nFinally, I will determine the closest bar from the list of confirmed wheelchair accessible bars. \n\nLet's get started with the distance calculations to determine which bar is the closest.
