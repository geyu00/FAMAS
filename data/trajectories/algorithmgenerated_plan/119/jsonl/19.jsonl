{"agent": "VerificationExpert", "content": "To verify the accuracy of the list of gyms within 5 miles of the Mothman Museum, I will follow the steps outlined in the plan. Specifically, I will re-evaluate the coordinates and distances using the Haversine formula, ensure that only gyms (excluding gymnastics centers) are listed, and confirm that they are indeed within the 5-mile radius by car.\n\nHere's the plan and the code to execute the verification process:\n\n1.
