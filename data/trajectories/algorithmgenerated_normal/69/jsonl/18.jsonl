The Video Content Analyst will watch the video and identify the timestamp where the question \"Isn't that hot?\" is asked.\n2. The Audio Transcription Specialist will transcribe Teal'c's response to the question.\n3. The Quality Checker will verify the accuracy of the transcription.\n\n## Output format\nTeal'c's response to the question \"Isn't that hot?\"\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The transcription must be accurate and match Teal'c's exact words.\n- The timestamp of the question and response should be noted.\n\n## Previous results and reason for the results\nThe previous attempt failed due to issues with retrieving or downloading the video and its captions. The experts suggested using `yt-dlp` for downloading the video and `ffmpeg` for merging the video and audio files."}
