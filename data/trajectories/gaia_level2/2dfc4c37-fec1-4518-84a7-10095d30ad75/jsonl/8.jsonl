It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and an additional educated guess:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the overlap between the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies and the top 10 highest-grossing domestic movies for the year 2020.\n   - Box Office Mojo's 2020 Worldwide Box Office list is the source for the information.\n   - The top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies of 2020 from Box Office Mojo have been successfully extracted.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific list of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic (U.S.) movies of 2020 from Box Office Mojo.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of movies that appear in both the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide list and the top 10 highest-grossing domestic list for 2020.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on typical trends, it is likely that a significant number of the top 10 worldwide movies will also be in the top 10 domestic list, but the exact number is not known without checking the data.\n   - Given the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry in 2020, there might be fewer international releases in the U.S. domestic market compared to previous years, which could affect the overlap between the two lists.\n\n### Additional Information\n- **Top 10 Highest-Grossing Worldwide Movies of 2020 (from Box Office Mojo):**\n  1. **Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Movie: Mugen Train** - $469,119,320\n  2. **The Eight Hundred** - $461,421,559\n  3. **Bad Boys for Life** - $426,505,244\n  4. **My People, My Homeland** - $422,390,820\n  5. **Tenet** - $365,304,105\n  6. **Sonic the Hedgehog** - $319,715,683\n  7. **Dolittle** - $251,410,631\n  8. **Jiang Ziya** - $240,646,355\n  9. **A Little Red Flower** - $216,000,000\n  10. **The Croods: A New Age** - $215,905,815\n\n### Next Steps\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Box Office Mojo page for the 2020 Domestic Box Office list and extract the top 10 highest-grossing domestic movies along with their rankings.\n- **Assistant**: Compare the two lists to determine the number of overlapping movies.\n- **Assistant**: Provide the final numerical answer.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: The WebSurfer navigated to the \"Daily Box Office For 2025\" page instead of the \"2020 Domestic Box Office\" page. This was likely due to a misinterpretation of the navigation options or a mistake in clicking the correct link.\n- **Lack of Verification**: There was no step to verify that the correct page was loaded after each navigation, which led to the extraction of irrelevant data.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Verify Page Load**: After each navigation, verify that the correct page is loaded by checking for specific keywords or elements on the page.\n- **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear and detailed instructions for each step to ensure the WebSurfer navigates to the correct pages.\n- **Extract Data Carefully**: Once on the correct page, carefully extract the required data and double-check the accuracy.\n\n### Updated Plan\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Box Office Mojo's main page.\n  - Verify that the main page is loaded by checking for the presence of the \"Domestic\", \"International\", and \"Worldwide\" tabs.\n- **WebSurfer**: Click on the \"Yearly\" tab under the \"Domestic\" section.\n  - Verify that the \"2020 Domestic Box Office\" page is loaded by checking for the presence of the year \"2020\" and the word \"Domestic\" in the page title.\n- **WebSurfer**: Extract the top 10 highest-grossing domestic movies from the 2020 list along with their rankings.\n- **Assistant**: Compare the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies list with the top 10 highest-grossing domestic movies list.\n- **Assistant**: Count the number of overlapping movies.\n- **Assistant**: Provide the final numerical answer."}
