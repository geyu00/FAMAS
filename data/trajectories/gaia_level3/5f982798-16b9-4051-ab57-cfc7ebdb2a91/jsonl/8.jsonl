How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - The paper contained a diagram of an X-ray time profile.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts in July 2020.\n   - The user is asking for the difference in seconds in the measured time span between the two diagrams.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact duration of the measured time span in the X-ray time profile diagram from the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact duration of the measured time span in the burst-1 diagram from the July 2020 paper.\n   - Both papers can be found on Arxiv.org using the provided dates and keywords (e.g., \"multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts,\" \"X-ray time profile,\" \"burst-1\").\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans once the durations are known.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The difference in seconds is likely to be a small number, as both diagrams are related to fast radio bursts, which typically have short durations.\n   - The specific authors involved in both papers might provide a clue to their consistency in measurement techniques, which could help in estimating the difference.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for the March 2021 paper on Arxiv.org using keywords such as \"multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts\" and \"X-ray time profile.\"\n- **Step 2:** Once the paper is located, ask WebSurfer to find and note the duration of the measured time span in the X-ray time profile diagram.\n- **Step 3:** Use WebSurfer to search for the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.org using keywords such as \"fast radio bursts\" and \"burst-1 diagram.\"\n- **Step 4:** Once the paper is located, ask WebSurfer to find and note the duration of the measured time span in the burst-1 diagram.\n- **Step 5:** Calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n- **Step 6:** Provide the final answer, which is the difference in seconds."}

Introduction\n\nThe multiwavelength (MWL) approach to study transient astronomical events has demonstrated its\neffectiveness in solving many puzzles in astronomy, both related to “local” and extragalactic sources. The\nGamma Ray Burst (GRB) phenomenon represents a perfect example. Wide area detectors (e.g., high-energy\nmonitors) or speciﬁc surveys monitoring large areas of the sky can detect events that only last for a short\nperiod of time. Being able to reduce positional uncertainties and perform timely MWL observations\nusing sensitive and high-enough resolution instruments could be the only way to discriminate among\nthe possible progenitors. This is a key point when the transient astronomical event is only detected in a\n\nUniverse 2021, 7, 76; doi:10.3390/universe7030076\n\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/universe\n\n\fUniverse 2021, 7, 76\n\n2 of 48\n\nsingle band of the electromagnetic spectrum or when multiple sources could produce that event. Studying\nthe source emission in a as wide as possible spectral band justiﬁes huge efforts in terms of observational\ntime and manpower. It, typically, turns out to be the only way to solve the most challenging questions in\nastrophysics.\n\nFast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are among the most studied astrophysical transients, still their origin and\nwhether there are multiple types of progenitors and emission mechanisms are still open questions (see [1–5]\nfor a review). Are (apparently) one-off and repeating events representative of distinct samples or are they\nthe realization of a very wide timescales distribution of the same objects class? Can the periodicity seen in\na few FRBs be reconciled with the proposed models? Is the behavior distinctive of a class or sub-class of\nFRBs? Of the about 140 distinct sources known [https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/] (accessed on 1 March 2021)\n(but we are aware that many more have been discovered but remain unpublished at the time of writing this\nreview), only for a bunch of them a MWL search campaign was possible, in particular for the two repeating\n(and periodic) sources FRB 20121102A (commonly referred as FRB 121102) and FRB 20180916B (also referred\nas FRB 180916 and FRB 180916.J0158+65, see below for the details). What makes FRB searches even more\nchallenging than for other transients"}

For example while a short GRB detected in the γ-rays can also last a few tens of\nmilliseconds [6,7], it can remain detectable at other wavelengths for days or longer. In the FRB case, even though\nsome of the many, still viable, emission mechanisms predict a sort of afterglow emission similar to that of GRBs,\nthey also predict a very weak signal on time scales of (at most) minutes after the radio burst. Therefore it seems\nmuch more promising searching for an almost simultaneous, ms-duration burst also at wavelengths outside the\nradio band. The recently proposed unified magnetar models by Lu et al. (2020) [8] and Margalit et al. (2020a) [9]\nsupport this scenario. This would then require MWL simultaneous observational campaigns and the use of\ndetectors capable of acquiring data at a high cadence. Fine time resolution is normal for high-energy detectors\non-board satellites, much less for on-ground optical/NIR cameras.\n\nIn spite of the lack of MWL detections, possibly due to the limited capabilities of existing instruments,\nthere is no doubt that also non-detections in FRB follow-up campaigns remain of great importance. Collecting\nobservational data and flux upper limits at all wavelengths are helpful to constrain rate and spectral properties,\nas well as to identify periods of active emission phases and then estimate the probability of events detection.\nThis is the case for repeating FRBs (rFRBs). Upper limits on fluxes are also relevant to constrain the fluence\nratios between the high energy bands (optical and X-/γ-ray) and the radio band, which in turn put constraints\non the proposed FRB emission models (e.g., [10], http://frbtheorycat.org (accessed on 1 March 2021)). At the\ncurrent stage of the FRB research, observational data that can rule out theories represent a highly valuable\nwork. Vacuum synchrotron maser, plasma synchrotron maser and synchrotron maser from magnetized\nshocks, coherent curvature emission, are among the most invoked mechanisms (see e.g., [4,5,11] for a review)\nbut, as it was the case for GRBs, the controversy on which radiation mechanism fits best the data may last\nawhile before reaching a final conclusion. With the additional complication of the (apparent/real) dicothomy\nof one-off and repeating bursts. Meanwhile, coordinated MWL observing campaigns, in particular of rFRBs,\nrepresent a key point to verify/challenge their predictions.\n\nAs new MWL observational data are being published on the transient emission from the Galactic\nmagnetars SGR J1935+2154 [12–18], 1E 1547.0–5408 [19], XTE J1810–197 [20], Swift J1818.0–1607 [21],\nsimilarities with the FRB phenomena become more and more striking, and then the possible common\nphysical processes involved [8]. On the other hand MWL campaigns on FRB 20180916B can rule out the\noccurrence of magnetar giant ﬂares (MGF) (E < 1045−47 erg) either simultaneous to a few radio bursts,\nor in general during some of the radio-burst active phases [22–26] and constrain the possible associated\npersistent X-ray luminosity to <2 × 1040 erg s−1 [22], which is still decades above the observed persistent\nluminosity of magnetars. In addition, the possible existence of a population of extragalactic magnetars\nthat are equally or even more active than their Galactic siblings and that can emit even more energetic\n\n\fUniverse 2021, 7, 76\n\n3 of 48\n\nﬂares [27,28], as was also the recent case of a MGF from NGC 253 (Sculptor Galaxy) at 3.5 Mpc [29–31],\nadds to the case of monitoring the high-energy activity of nearby rFRBs. In parallel, the expected growing\nsample of rFRBs in the coming years will enable a systematic search for past activity hidden in the optical\nand high-energy surveys, as was done for the few known cases (e.g., [32–36]).\n\nRegarding the FRBs host galaxies, as of today 13 have been ﬁrmly identiﬁed. Such limited sample\ndoes not yet allow us to draw solid conclusions about potential progenitors as observational selection\nbiases could play an important role. However statistical studies of stellar masses and star formation rates\n(SFRs) suggest that, at least some of them, are consistent with the host galaxies of core-collapse supernovae\n(CCSNe), but not with the hosts of long GRBs (LGRBs) and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) [37–39].\nThis strengthens the possibility that FRBs are produced by magnetars. As a larger sample of FRB hosts\nbecomes available, possibly with offset distribution and local environment studies, it may turn up evidence\nfor alternate magnetar formation channels or call for a second progenitor scenario for FRBs.\n\nFRB 20121102A [40] was the ﬁrst FRB for which multiple bursts were detected, and is then known as\nthe “repeating FRB” [41]. Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) sub-arcsec localisation allowed its host\ngalaxy at z (cid:39) 0.193 to be identiﬁed [42–44]. FRB 20180916B [45] was discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen\nIntensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and was immediately identiﬁed as a repeater.

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - The paper contained a diagram of an X-ray time profile.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts in July 2020.\n   - The user is asking for the difference in seconds in the measured time span between the two diagrams.\n   - The March 2021 paper is titled \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\" and is available at [arXiv:2103.07786](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact duration of the measured time span in the X-ray time profile diagram from the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact duration of the measured time span in the burst-1 diagram from the July 2020 paper.\n   - The title and specific details of the July 2020 paper, including the author(s) who are common with the March 2021 paper.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans once the durations are known.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The difference in seconds is likely to be a small number, as both diagrams are related to fast radio bursts, which typically have short durations.\n   - The specific authors involved in both papers might provide a clue to their consistency in measurement techniques, which could help in estimating the difference.\n   - Given that the March 2021 paper discusses multiwavelength observations and emphasizes the importance of fine time resolution, the X-ray time profile diagram is likely to have a very precise time span measurement.\n   - The July 2020 paper, being earlier, might have less precise measurements due to technological limitations at the time, but it is still expected to be in the range of milliseconds to seconds for fast radio bursts.\n   - The authors' consistency in measurement techniques suggests that the time spans measured in both papers are likely to be comparable, with any differences being relatively small.\n\n### Updated Plan\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for the March 2021 paper on Arxiv.org using the provided link and locate the X-ray time profile diagram. Note the duration of the measured time span.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to search for the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.org using keywords such as \"fast radio bursts\" and \"burst-1 diagram.\" Identify the common authors and locate the burst-1 diagram. Note the duration of the measured time span.\n- **Step 3:** Calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n- **Step 4:** Provide the final answer, which is the difference in seconds.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Repetition of Steps:** The previous attempts repeatedly focused on opening the PDF file and locating the X-ray time profile diagram without making significant progress.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions:** The instructions to WebSurfer and FileSurfer were too general, leading to inefficiency and repeated failures.\n- **No Clear Path to Extract Information:** There was no clear plan for how to extract the specific information (duration of the measured time span) once the diagram was located.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for the March 2021 paper on Arxiv.org using the provided link and open the PDF directly.\n- **Step 2:** Use FileSurfer to open the PDF file '/workspace/2103.07786v2.pdf' and navigate to the X-ray time profile diagram. Specifically, search for the phrase \"X-ray time profile\" or similar keywords to locate the diagram.\n- **Step 3:** Once the diagram is located, note the duration of the measured time span.

Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks to be the only viable strategy. Additionally, small/medium size radiotelescopes co-pointing higher energies telescopes look a very interesting and cheap complementary observational strategy. \nComments:\n44 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication on Universe\nSubjects:\nHigh Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)Cite as:\narXiv:2103.07786 [astro-ph.HE] \n(or \narXiv:2103.07786v2 [astro-ph.HE] for this version) \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2103.07786\nFocus to learn more\nJournal reference:\nUniverse 2021, 7, 76\nRelated DOI: \nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/universe7030076\nFocus to learn more\nSubmission history\n From: Luciano Nicastro Dr. [\nview email] \n[v1] Sat, 13 Mar 2021 20:39:49 UTC (14,577 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 25 Mar 2021 10:44:14 UTC (1,195 KB)\nAccess Paper:\nView PDFTeX SourceOther Formatsview license Current browse context: \nastro-ph.HE\n< prev  |  \nnext >new \n | recent \n | 2021-03 Change to browse by: \nastro-phReferences & Citations\nINSPIRE HEPNASA ADSGoogle ScholarSemantic Scholarexport BibTeX citation\nBookmark\n Bibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer \nCode, Data, Media\nDemos\nRelated Papers\n About arXivLabs\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"msapplication-TileColor\": \"#da532c\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"description\": \"Abstract page for arXiv paper 2103.07786: Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"arXiv.org\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786v2\",\n        \"og:image\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:secure_url\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"1200\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"700\",\n        \"og:image:alt\": \"arXiv logo\",\n        \"og:description\": \"The origin and phenomenology of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) remains unknown despite more than a decade of efforts.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - The paper contained a diagram of an X-ray time profile.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts in July 2020.\n   - The user is asking for the difference in seconds in the measured time span between the two diagrams.\n   - The March 2021 paper is titled \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\" and is available at [arXiv:2103.07786](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786).\n   - The PDF of the March 2021 paper has been successfully downloaded and is located at `/workspace/2103.07786v2.pdf`.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact duration of the measured time span in the X-ray time profile diagram from the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact duration of the measured time span in the burst-1 diagram from the July 2020 paper.\n   - The title and specific details of the July 2020 paper, including the author(s) who are common with the March 2021 paper.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the two measured time spans once the durations are known.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The difference in seconds is likely to be a small number, as both diagrams are related to fast radio bursts, which typically have short durations.\n   - The specific authors involved in both papers might provide a clue to their consistency in measurement techniques, which could help in estimating the difference.\n   - Given that the March 2021 paper discusses multiwavelength observations and emphasizes the importance of fine time resolution, the X-ray time profile diagram is likely to have a very precise time span measurement.\n   - The July 2020 paper, being earlier, might have less precise measurements due to technological limitations at the time, but it is still expected to be in the range of milliseconds to seconds for fast radio bursts.\n   - The authors' consistency in measurement techniques suggests that the time spans measured in both papers are likely to be comparable, with any differences being relatively small.\n   - The X-ray time profile diagram in the March 2021 paper is likely to be found in the sections discussing high-energy observations or multiwavelength campaigns. Searching for keywords like \"X-ray,\" \"time profile,\" or \"high-energy\" should help locate it.\n   - The burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper is likely to be found in the sections discussing the initial detection or characterization of the burst. Searching for keywords like \"burst-1,\" \"initial detection,\" or \"time profile\" should help locate it.\n\n### Updated Plan\n- **Step 1:** Use FileSurfer to open the PDF file '/workspace/2103.07786v2.pdf' and search for the X-ray time profile diagram. Once you find it, note the duration of the measured time span. If the duration is not explicitly stated, take a screenshot of the diagram and provide it for further analysis.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to search for the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.org using keywords such as \"fast radio bursts\" and \"burst-1 diagram.\" Identify the common authors and locate the burst-1 diagram. Note the duration of the measured time span.\n- **Step 3:** Calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n- **Step 4:** Provide the final answer, which is the difference in seconds.\n\n### Action\n- **Step 1:** Open the PDF file '/workspace/2103.07786v2.pdf' and search for the X-ray time profile diagram. Once you find it, note the duration of the measured time span. If the duration is not explicitly stated, take a screenshot of the diagram and provide it for further analysis.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Repetition of Steps:** The previous attempts repeatedly focused on opening the PDF file and navigating to the first page without making significant progress in locating the X-ray time profile diagram.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions:** The instructions to FileSurfer and WebSurfer were too general, leading to inefficiency and repeated failures.\n- **No Clear Path to Extract Information:** There was no clear plan for how to extract the specific information (duration of the measured time span) once the diagram was located.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Step 1:** Use FileSurfer to open the PDF file '/workspace/2103.07786v2.pdf'.\n  - **Hint:** Search for the phrase \"X-ray time profile\" or similar keywords to locate the diagram.\n  - **Action:** Navigate through the pages and locate the X-ray time profile diagram.\n- **Step 2:** Once the diagram is located, note the duration of the measured time span.\n  - **Hint:** Look for a caption or legend that specifies the time span.\n  - **Action:** If the duration is not explicitly stated, take a screenshot of the diagram and provide it for further analysis.\n- **Step 3:** Use WebSurfer to search for the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.org using keywords such as \"fast radio bursts\" and \"burst-1 diagram.\"\n  - **Hint:** Look for common authors with the March 2021 paper.\n  - **Action:** Open the relevant paper and download the PDF.\n- **Step 4:** Use FileSurfer to open the PDF of the July 2020 paper.\n  - **Hint:** Search for the phrase \"burst-1\" or similar keywords to locate the diagram.\n  - **Action:** Navigate through the pages and locate the burst-1 diagram.\n- **Step 5:** Once the diagram is located, note the duration of the measured time span.\n  - **Hint:** Look for a caption or legend that specifies the time span.\n  - **Action:** If the duration is not explicitly stated, take a screenshot of the diagram and provide it for further analysis.\n- **Step 6:** Calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n  - **Hint:** Subtract the shorter duration from the longer duration.\n- **Step 7:** Provide the final answer, which is the difference in seconds.\n\n### Detailed Instructions\n- **Step 1:** Use FileSurfer to open the PDF file '/workspace/2103.07786v2.pdf'.\n  - **Hint:** Search for the phrase \"X-ray time profile\" or similar keywords to locate the diagram.\n  - **Action:** Navigate through the pages and locate the X-ray time profile diagram.\n- **Step 2:** Once the diagram is located, note the duration of the measured time span.\n  - **Hint:** Look for a caption or legend that specifies the time span.\n  - **Action:** If the duration is not explicitly stated, take a screenshot of the diagram and provide it for further analysis.\n- **Step 3:** Use WebSurfer to search for the July 2020 paper on Arxiv.org using keywords such as \"fast radio bursts\" and \"burst-1 diagram.\"\n  - **Hint:** Look for common authors with the March 2021 paper.\n  - **Action:** Open the relevant paper and download the PDF.\n- **Step 4:** Use FileSurfer to open the PDF of the July 2020 paper.\n  - **Hint:** Search for the phrase \"burst-1\" or similar keywords to locate the diagram.\n  - **Action:** Navigate through the pages and locate the burst-1 diagram.\n- **Step 5:** Once the diagram is located, note the duration of the measured time span.\n  - **Hint:** Look for a caption or legend that specifies the time span.\n  - **Action:** If the duration is not explicitly stated, take a screenshot of the diagram and provide it for further analysis.\n- **Step 6:** Calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n  - **Hint:** Subtract the shorter duration from the longer duration.\n- **Step 7:** Provide the final answer, which is the difference in seconds.\n\n### Action\n- **Step 1:** Use FileSurfer to open the PDF file '/workspace/2103.07786v2.pdf' and search for the X-ray time profile diagram.
