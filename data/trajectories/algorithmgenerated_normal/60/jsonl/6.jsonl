Therefore, the total number of unique winners of American Idol is 21.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the difference.\n\nNow, I will calculate the difference in the number of unique winners between Survivor and American Idol:\n\n- Unique winners of Survivor: 44\n- Unique winners of American Idol: 21\n\nCalculating the difference: \n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Survivor Winners} - \\text{American Idol Winners} = 44 - 21 \\]\n\n### Implementation\n\nLetâ€™s implement this calculation using a simple Python script. I'll execute the calculation in the Computer_terminal. \n\n```python\n# Number of unique winners\nsurvivor_winners = 44\namerican_idol_winners = 21\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference = survivor_winners - american_idol_winners\nprint(difference)\n``` \n\nNow, I'll run this code in the Computer_terminal."}
