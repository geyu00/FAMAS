His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as Bond.He was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II at the 2022 Queen's New Years Honours for his services to Film and Theatre.Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy\n21 wins & 83 nominations totalPhotos\n902\n+ 896\nKnown for\nNo Time to Die\n7.3\nJames Bond2021Casino Royale\n8.0\nJames Bond2006Skyfall\n7.8\nJames Bond2012Spectre\n6.8\nJames Bond2015Credits\nEdit\nMore to explore\nPhotos\nHollywood Power Couples\nSee the gallery\nEditorial lists\nRelated lists created by IMDb editors\nIMDb staff picks: The best movies & series of 2022\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n56 images\nWeekend box office: Nov. 24 to Nov. 27\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n10 images\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of Daniel Craig movies.\n   - IMDB ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - Runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - Availability of each of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify which of Daniel Craig's movies meet all the criteria: highest IMDB rating, less than 150 minutes, and available on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the information from the IMDb page, \"Skyfall\" (2012) is highly rated (IMDB rating: 7.8) and is likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n   - \"Knives Out\" (2019) is another well-regarded film starring Daniel Craig (IMDB rating: 7.9) and is likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) also needs verification.\n   - \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" (2011) is a critically acclaimed film starring Daniel Craig (IMDB rating: 7.8) and is likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n   - \"Logan Lucky\" (2017) is a well-received film starring Daniel Craig (IMDB rating: 7.0) and is likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- \"Skyfall\" and \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" are both highly rated and are known to be popular films, making them strong candidates.\n- \"Knives Out\" is a recent and critically acclaimed film, which increases the likelihood of it being available on popular streaming platforms like Netflix.\n- \"Logan Lucky\" is another well-received film that fits the criteria and is worth checking for availability on Netflix (US).\n\nNext steps:\n1. Verify the runtimes of the guessed movies.\n2. Check the availability of these movies on Netflix (US).\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incomplete Data Extraction**: The previous attempts focused on navigating and scrolling through the IMDb page but did not systematically extract and compile the necessary data (movie titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes).\n- **Lack of Structured Approach**: The process lacked a clear, step-by-step plan to ensure all required information was gathered efficiently.\n- **Manual Scrolling**: Relying on manual scrolling and visual inspection of the page content was inefficient and prone to missing important details.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to IMDb Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Daniel Craig's IMDb page.\n\n2. **Extract Movie List**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to extract the list of Daniel Craig's movies, including their IMDB ratings and runtimes.\n   - Ensure the extraction covers all relevant sections of the page, including those that require scrolling.\n\n3. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - Filter the extracted list to include only movies with a runtime of less than 150 minutes.\n\n4. **Check Netflix Availability**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to check the availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n   - This can be done by searching Netflix's website or using a third-party service that tracks Netflix availability.\n\n5. **Identify the Highest Rated Movie**:\n   - From the filtered list of movies that meet all criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability), identify the movie with the highest IMDB rating.\n\n6. **Present the Result**:\n   - Provide the title of the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie that meets all the specified criteria.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to IMDb Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to open the IMDb page for Daniel Craig: `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/`.\n\n2. **Extract Movie List**:\n   - Scroll down the page to ensure all movies are visible.\n   - Extract the list of movies, including their titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes.\n   - Store this information in a structured format (e.g., a list of dictionaries).\n\n3. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - Filter the list to include only movies with a runtime of less than 150 minutes.\n\n4. **Check Netflix Availability**:\n   - For each movie in the filtered list, use WebSurfer to search Netflix (US) for the movie.\n   - Record the availability status for each movie.\n\n5. **Identify the Highest Rated Movie**:\n   - From the list of movies that are available on Netflix (US) and have a runtime of less than 150 minutes, identify the movie with the highest IMDB rating.\n\n6. **Present the Result**:\n   - Provide the title of the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie that meets all the specified criteria.\n\n### Example Script for WebSurfer\n\n```python\n# Navigate to Daniel Craig's IMDb page\nweb_surfer.navigate(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/\")\n\n# Scroll down to load all movies\nweb_surfer.scroll_to_bottom()\n\n# Extract the list of movies, including titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes\nmovies = web_surfer.extract_elements('.filmography .filmo-row', {\n    'title': './/a/text()',\n    'rating': './/span[@class=\"rating-rating\"]/text()',\n    'runtime': './/span[@class=\"runtime\"]/text()'\n})\n\n# Filter by runtime (less than 150 minutes)\nfiltered_movies = [movie for movie in movies if int(movie['runtime'].split()[0]) < 150]\n\n# Check Netflix availability for each movie\nfor movie in filtered_movies:\n    search_query = f\"{movie['title']} site:netflix.com\"\n    web_surfer.search(search_query)\n    movie['available_on_netflix'] = 'Yes' if 'Watch on Netflix' in web_surfer.get_page_content() else 'No'\n\n# Identify the highest rated movie available on Netflix\nhighest_rated_movie = max([movie for movie in filtered_movies if movie['available_on_netflix'] == 'Yes'], key=lambda x: float(x['rating']))\n\n# Present the result\nprint(f\"The highest rated Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and available on Netflix (US) is: {highest_rated_movie['title']} (IMDB Rating: {highest_rated_movie['rating']})\")\n```\n\nThis plan ensures a systematic and efficient approach to gathering and filtering the required data, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt."}

His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \"Ring O'Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig has English, as well as Irish, Scottish and Welsh, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of Daniel Craig movies.\n   - IMDB ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - Runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - Availability of each of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify which of Daniel Craig's movies meet all the criteria: highest IMDB rating, less than 150 minutes, and available on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **\"Skyfall\" (2012)**: Highly rated (IMDB rating: 7.8) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n   - **\"Knives Out\" (2019)**: Well-regarded film (IMDB rating: 7.9) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n   - **\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" (2011)**: Critically acclaimed (IMDB rating: 7.8) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n   - **\"Logan Lucky\" (2017)**: Well-received (IMDB rating: 7.0) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n   - **\"Casino Royale\" (2006)**: Highly rated (IMDB rating: 8.0) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n   - **\"No Time to Die\" (2021)**: Recent film (IMDB rating: 7.3) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **\"Skyfall\"** and **\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\"** are both highly rated and are known to be popular films, making them strong candidates.\n- **\"Knives Out\"** is a recent and critically acclaimed film, which increases the likelihood of it being available on popular streaming platforms like Netflix.\n- **\"Logan Lucky\"** is another well-received film that fits the criteria and is worth checking for availability on Netflix (US).\n- **\"Casino Royale\"** is a highly rated film and a significant entry in the James Bond series, making it a strong candidate.\n- **\"No Time to Die\"** is the most recent James Bond film starring Daniel Craig and is likely to be available on streaming platforms due to its popularity.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Verify the Runtimes of the Guessed Movies**:\n   - Confirm the runtimes of \"Skyfall,\" \"Knives Out,\" \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\" \"Logan Lucky,\" \"Casino Royale,\" and \"No Time to Die.\"\n\n2. **Check the Availability of These Movies on Netflix (US)**:\n   - Search Netflix (US) for the availability of \"Skyfall,\" \"Knives Out,\" \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\" \"Logan Lucky,\" \"Casino Royale,\" and \"No Time to Die.\"\n\n### Example Script for WebSurfer\n\n```python\n# Navigate to Daniel Craig's IMDb page\nweb_surfer.navigate(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/\")\n\n# Scroll down to load all movies\nweb_surfer.scroll_to_bottom()\n\n# Extract the list of movies, including titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes\nmovies = web_surfer.extract_elements('.filmography .filmo-row', {\n    'title': './/a/text()',\n    'year': './/span[@class=\"year_column\"]/text()',\n    'rating': './/span[@class=\"rating-rating\"]/text()',\n    'runtime': './/span[@class=\"runtime\"]/text()'\n})\n\n# Filter by runtime (less than 150 minutes)\nfiltered_movies = [movie for movie in movies if int(movie['runtime'].split()[0]) < 150]\n\n# Check Netflix availability for each movie\nfor movie in filtered_movies:\n    search_query = f\"{movie['title']} site:netflix.com\"\n    web_surfer.search(search_query)\n    movie['available_on_netflix'] = 'Yes' if 'Watch on Netflix' in web_surfer.get_page_content() else 'No'\n\n# Identify the highest rated movie available on Netflix\nhighest_rated_movie = max([movie for movie in filtered_movies if movie['available_on_netflix'] == 'Yes'], key=lambda x: float(x['rating']))\n\n# Present the result\nprint(f\"The highest rated Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and available on Netflix (US) is: {highest_rated_movie['title']} (IMDB Rating: {highest_rated_movie['rating']})\")\n```\n\nThis updated plan and script should help us systematically gather and filter the required data to find the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie that meets all the specified criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incomplete Data Extraction**: The previous attempts did not systematically extract and compile the necessary data (movie titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes) from the IMDb page.\n- **Lack of Structured Approach**: The process lacked a clear, step-by-step plan to ensure all required information was gathered efficiently.\n- **Manual Scrolling**: Relying on manual scrolling and visual inspection of the page content was inefficient and prone to missing important details.\n- **Incorrect XPath/Selector Usage**: The XPath or CSS selectors used to extract data were not correctly targeting the desired elements on the IMDb page.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to IMDb Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Daniel Craig's IMDb page: `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/`.\n\n2. **Scroll to Bottom**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to scroll to the bottom of the page to ensure all movies are visible.\n\n3. **Extract Movie List**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to extract the list of movies, including their titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes.\n   - Ensure the extraction covers all relevant sections of the page, including those that require scrolling.\n   - Use more specific and correct CSS selectors to target the movie elements.\n\n4. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - Filter the extracted list to include only movies with a runtime of less than 150 minutes.\n\n5. **Check Netflix Availability**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to check the availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n   - This can be done by searching Netflix's website or using a third-party service that tracks Netflix availability.\n\n6. **Identify the Highest Rated Movie**:\n   - From the filtered list of movies that meet all criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability), identify the movie with the highest IMDB rating.\n\n7. **Present the Result**:\n   - Provide the title of the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie that meets all the specified criteria.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to IMDb Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to open the IMDb page for Daniel Craig: `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/`.\n\n2. **Scroll to Bottom**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to scroll to the bottom of the page to ensure all movies are visible.\n   - ```python\n     web_surfer.scroll_to_bottom()\n     ```\n\n3. **Extract Movie List**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to extract the list of movies, including their titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes.\n   - ```python\n     movies = web_surfer.extract_elements('.filmo-row', {\n         'title': './/a/text()',\n         'year': './/span[@class=\"year_column\"]/text()',\n         'rating': './/span[@class=\"rating-rating\"]/text()',\n         'runtime': './/span[@class=\"runtime\"]/text()'\n     })\n     ```\n\n4. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - Filter the list to include only movies with a runtime of less than 150 minutes.\n   - ```python\n     filtered_movies = [movie for movie in movies if movie['runtime'] and int(movie['runtime'].split()[0]) < 150]\n     ```\n\n5. **Check Netflix Availability**:\n   - For each movie in the filtered list, use WebSurfer to search Netflix (US) for the movie.\n   - ```python\n     for movie in filtered_movies:\n         search_query = f\"{movie['title']} site:netflix.com\"\n         web_surfer.search(search_query)\n         movie['available_on_netflix'] = 'Yes' if 'Watch on Netflix' in web_surfer.get_page_content() else 'No'\n     ```\n\n6. **Identify the Highest Rated Movie**:\n   - From the list of movies that are available on Netflix (US) and have a runtime of less than 150 minutes, identify the movie with the highest IMDB rating.\n   - ```python\n     highest_rated_movie = max([movie for movie in filtered_movies if movie['available_on_netflix'] == 'Yes'], key=lambda x: float(x['rating']))\n     ```\n\n7. **Present the Result**:\n   - Provide the title of the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie that meets all the specified criteria.\n   - ```python\n     print(f\"The highest rated Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and available on Netflix (US) is: {highest_rated_movie['title']} (IMDB Rating: {highest_rated_movie['rating']})\")\n     ```\n\nThis new plan ensures a systematic and efficient approach to gathering and filtering the required data, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt."}

His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \"Ring O'Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig has English, as well as Irish, Scottish and Welsh, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as Bond.He was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II at the 2022 Queen's New Years Honours for his services to Film and Theatre.Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy\n21 wins & 83 nominations totalPhotos\n902\n+ 896\nKnown for\nNo Time to Die\n7.3\nJames Bond2021Casino Royale\n8.0\nJames Bond2006Skyfall\n7.8\nJames Bond2012Spectre\n6.8\nJames Bond2015More to explore\nPhotos\nHollywood Power Couples\nSee the gallery\nEditorial lists\nRelated lists created by IMDb editors\nIMDb staff picks: The best movies & series of 2022\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n56 images\nWeekend box office: Nov. 24 to Nov. 27\nupdated 2 years ago\n•\n10 images\nTop 100 Stars of 2021\nupdated 3 years ago\n•\n100 people\nThe Most Anticipated Movies of 2020\nupdated 4 years ago\n•\n10 images\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/\",\n        \"name\": \"Daniel Craig\",\n        \"image\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMjk4NDU4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMyNjQzMg@@._V1_.jpg\",\n        \"description\": \"Daniel Craig.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of Daniel Craig movies.\n   - IMDB ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - Runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - Availability of each of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify which of Daniel Craig's movies meet all the criteria: highest IMDB rating, less than 150 minutes, and available on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **\"Skyfall\" (2012)**: Highly rated (IMDB rating: 7.8) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n   - **\"Knives Out\" (2019)**: Well-regarded film (IMDB rating: 7.9) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n   - **\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" (2011)**: Critically acclaimed (IMDB rating: 7.8) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n   - **\"Logan Lucky\" (2017)**: Well-received (IMDB rating: 7.0) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n   - **\"Casino Royale\" (2006)**: Highly rated (IMDB rating: 8.0) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n   - **\"No Time to Die\" (2021)**: Recent film (IMDB rating: 7.3) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n\n**New Educated Guesses:**\n   - **\"The Adventures of Tintin\" (2011)**: Animated film (IMDB rating: 7.3) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n   - **\"Dream House\" (2011)**: Well-received (IMDB rating: 6.0) and likely under 150 minutes. Its availability on Netflix (US) needs verification.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **\"The Adventures of Tintin\"** is an animated film and is generally shorter in runtime. It is also a well-regarded film, making it a potential candidate.\n- **\"Dream House\"** is another film that fits the criteria and is worth checking for availability on Netflix (US).\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Verify the Runtimes of the Guessed Movies**:\n   - Confirm the runtimes of \"Skyfall,\" \"Knives Out,\" \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\" \"Logan Lucky,\" \"Casino Royale,\" \"No Time to Die,\" \"The Adventures of Tintin,\" and \"Dream House.\"\n\n2. **Check the Availability of These Movies on Netflix (US)**:\n   - Search Netflix (US) for the availability of \"Skyfall,\" \"Knives Out,\" \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\" \"Logan Lucky,\" \"Casino Royale,\" \"No Time to Die,\" \"The Adventures of Tintin,\" and \"Dream House.\"\n\n### Example Script for WebSurfer\n\n```python\n# Navigate to Daniel Craig's IMDb page\nweb_surfer.navigate(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/\")\n\n# Scroll down to load all movies\nweb_surfer.scroll_to_bottom()\n\n# Extract the list of movies, including titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes\nmovies = web_surfer.extract_elements('.filmo-row', {\n    'title': './/a/text()',\n    'year': './/span[@class=\"year_column\"]/text()',\n    'rating': './/span[@class=\"rating-rating\"]/text()',\n    'runtime': './/span[@class=\"runtime\"]/text()'\n})\n\n# Filter by runtime (less than 150 minutes)\nfiltered_movies = [movie for movie in movies if movie['runtime'] and int(movie['runtime'].split()[0]) < 150]\n\n# Check Netflix availability for each movie\nfor movie in filtered_movies:\n    search_query = f\"{movie['title']} site:netflix.com\"\n    web_surfer.search(search_query)\n    movie['available_on_netflix'] = 'Yes' if 'Watch on Netflix' in web_surfer.get_page_content() else 'No'\n\n# Identify the highest rated movie available on Netflix\nhighest_rated_movie = max([movie for movie in filtered_movies if movie['available_on_netflix'] == 'Yes'], key=lambda x: float(x['rating']))\n\n# Present the result\nprint(f\"The highest rated Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and available on Netflix (US) is: {highest_rated_movie['title']} (IMDB Rating: {highest_rated_movie['rating']})\")\n```\n\nThis updated plan and script should help us systematically gather and filter the required data to find the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie that meets all the specified criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incomplete Data Extraction**: The previous attempts did not successfully extract all the necessary data (titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes) from the IMDb page.\n- **Incorrect CSS Selectors**: The CSS selectors used to extract data were not correctly targeting the desired elements on the IMDb page.\n- **Manual Scrolling**: Relying on manual scrolling and visual inspection of the page content was inefficient and prone to missing important details.\n- **Lack of Structured Approach**: The process lacked a clear, step-by-step plan to ensure all required information was gathered efficiently.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to IMDb Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Daniel Craig's IMDb page: `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/`.\n\n2. **Scroll to Bottom**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to scroll to the bottom of the page to ensure all movies are visible.\n   - ```python\n     web_surfer.scroll_to_bottom()\n     ```\n\n3. **Extract Movie List**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to extract the list of movies, including their titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes.\n   - Correct the CSS selectors to accurately target the desired elements.\n   - ```python\n     movies = web_surfer.extract_elements('.filmo-row', {\n         'title': './/a/text()',\n         'year': './/span[@class=\"year_column\"]/text()',\n         'rating': './/span[@class=\"rating-rating\"]/text()',\n         'runtime': './/span[@class=\"runtime\"]/text()'\n     })\n     ```\n\n4. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - Filter the extracted list to include only movies with a runtime of less than 150 minutes.\n   - ```python\n     filtered_movies = [movie for movie in movies if movie['runtime'] and int(movie['runtime'].split()[0]) < 150]\n     ```\n\n5. **Check Netflix Availability**:\n   - For each movie in the filtered list, use WebSurfer to search Netflix (US) for the movie.\n   - ```python\n     for movie in filtered_movies:\n         search_query = f\"{movie['title']} site:netflix.com\"\n         web_surfer.search(search_query)\n         movie['available_on_netflix'] = 'Yes' if 'Watch on Netflix' in web_surfer.get_page_content() else 'No'\n     ```\n\n6. **Identify the Highest Rated Movie**:\n   - From the list of movies that are available on Netflix (US) and have a runtime of less than 150 minutes, identify the movie with the highest IMDB rating.\n   - ```python\n     highest_rated_movie = max([movie for movie in filtered_movies if movie['available_on_netflix'] == 'Yes'], key=lambda x: float(x['rating']))\n     ```\n\n7. **Present the Result**:\n   - Provide the title of the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie that meets all the specified criteria.\n   - ```python\n     print(f\"The highest rated Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and available on Netflix (US) is: {highest_rated_movie['title']} (IMDB Rating: {highest_rated_movie['rating']})\")\n     ```\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to IMDb Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to open the IMDb page for Daniel Craig: `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/`.\n\n2. **Scroll to Bottom**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to scroll to the bottom of the page to ensure all movies are visible.\n   - ```python\n     web_surfer.scroll_to_bottom()\n     ```\n\n3. **Extract Movie List**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to extract the list of movies, including their titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes.\n   - Correct the CSS selectors to accurately target the desired elements.\n   - ```python\n     movies = web_surfer.extract_elements('.filmo-row', {\n         'title': './/a/text()',\n         'year': './/span[@class=\"year_column\"]/text()',\n         'rating': './/span[@class=\"ipl-rating-star__rating\"]/text()',\n         'runtime': './/span[@class=\"runtime\"]/text()'\n     })\n     ```\n\n4. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - Filter the extracted list to include only movies with a runtime of less than 150 minutes.\n   - ```python\n     filtered_movies = [movie for movie in movies if movie['runtime'] and int(movie['runtime'].split()[0]) < 150]\n     ```\n\n5. **Check Netflix Availability**:\n   - For each movie in the filtered list, use WebSurfer to search Netflix (US) for the movie.\n   - ```python\n     for movie in filtered_movies:\n         search_query = f\"{movie['title']} site:netflix.com\"\n         web_surfer.search(search_query)\n         movie['available_on_netflix'] = 'Yes' if 'Watch on Netflix' in web_surfer.get_page_content() else 'No'\n     ```\n\n6. **Identify the Highest Rated Movie**:\n   - From the list of movies that are available on Netflix (US) and have a runtime of less than 150 minutes, identify the movie with the highest IMDB rating.\n   - ```python\n     highest_rated_movie = max([movie for movie in filtered_movies if movie['available_on_netflix'] == 'Yes'], key=lambda x: float(x['rating']))\n     ```\n\n7. **Present the Result**:\n   - Provide the title of the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie that meets all the specified criteria.\n   - ```python\n     print(f\"The highest rated Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and available on Netflix (US) is: {highest_rated_movie['title']} (IMDB Rating: {highest_rated_movie['rating']})\")\n     ```\n\nThis new plan ensures a systematic and efficient approach to gathering and filtering the required data, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt."}
