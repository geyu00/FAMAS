{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the American Alligator.\n   - The location of interest is west of Texas (excluding Texas).\n   - The source of information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - This information would likely be found in historical records or reports from the USGS.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are necessary based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, so it is reasonable to assume that any findings west of Texas would be relatively recent, possibly within the last century.\n   - The expansion of the alligator's range might be related to changes in habitat, climate, or human activity, but the exact year would need to be confirmed with historical data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Source**: Confirm that the USGS is the authoritative source for this information.\n- **Web Search**: Use WebSurfer to search for the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (excluding Texas) using the USGS website or other reliable sources.\n- **Verify Information**: Ensure the information is from a credible and official USGS report or publication.\n- **Summarize Findings**: Once the year is identified, summarize the key details and provide the answer."}

American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998).Disclaimer:\nThe Nonindigenous Occurrences section of the NAS species profiles has a new structure. The section is now dynamically updated from the NAS database to ensure that it contains the most current and accurate information. Occurrences are summarized in Table 1, alphabetically by state, with years of earliest and most recent observations, and the tally and names of drainages where the species was observed. The table contains hyperlinks to collections tables of specimens based on the states, years, and drainages selected.

See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The alligators spotted in Essex County, New Jersey, may have escaped a lagoon in Military Park, Newark (Anonymous in Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n Perhaps they had been part of a public animal display.\n The \nA. mississippiensis collected from Mesa County, Colorado, escaped from a roadside zoo (Livo et al., 1998), while the one collected from the Colorado River in California had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978).\n Conant (1977) suggested that an animal dealer intentionally established the \nA. mississippiensis population found in the Brownsville area of Cameron County, Texas.\nStatus: All the American alligators found in New York have been collected (Anderson and Habuda, 2001; Anonymous, 2001a, b; Beebe, 2001c; Heaton-Jones, 2001; Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). They are not established in this state nor could they survive the cold winters, and the story of alligators dwelling in New York City sewers is simply a well-entrenched myth (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). One of the alligators found in Union County, New Jersey, was collected; although there is no further word about the success of the 1933 great gator hunt started on the Passaic River in Essex County (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n All \nA. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).\n Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous \nA. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are \"thriving.\" There is no evidence of reproduction.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as \"not well established\" in Arizona.\nImpact of Introduction: There is no evidence that any of the nonindigenous occurrences of American alligators have had any impact on indigenous ecosystems; however, an established population of these massive carnivores in a southwestern state could negatively impact indigenous fauna. The introductions in Oklahoma, and the presumptive introduction in Cameron County, Texas, could compromise the genetic integrity of extant indigenous populations. As mentioned above, the status of indigenous alligators in Oklahoma could be obfuscated, thus creating difficulties when deciding conservation measures and future protective legislation. A large alligator is a potentially dangerous carnivore.\n While attacks on humans are exceedingly rare, they do occur on occasion (Pooley et al., 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Anonymous, 2002).\nRemarks: The taxonomy of A. mississippiensis has been reviewed or summarized by Smith and Smith (1977), King (1989), Ross and Ernst (1994), and Crother et al. (2000). Liner (1994) provides a Spanish vernacular name for the American alligator.  Brisbin et al. (1986), Gibbons and Semlitsch (1991), and Ross and Ernst (1994) provide the best literature reviews of the natural history of alligators. A variety of authors have contributed to or summarized the natural history and biology of American alligators (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973, 1976; Mount, 1975; Lang, 1987, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Vliet, 1989; and a variety of contributions compiled by Webb et al., 1987). Scientific and standard English names follow Crother (2008).Alligator mississippiensis is an aquatic, omnicarnivorous reptile capable of living in many types of waterways, both natural and man-made, and feeding upon almost any fauna it can catch (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Mount, 1975; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Some alligators dig deep holes with connecting dens than can remain filled with water during droughts, thus maintaining an aquatic environment for indigenous fauna (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Grenard, 1991).\n Courtship and mating involves complex visual and auditory displays directed at prospective mates and competitors (McIlhenny, 1935; Lang, 1987, 1989; Vliet, 1989).\n The female buries her hard-shelled eggs in a nest she constructs of dead vegetation and the surrounding muck (McIlhenny, 1935; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Females exhibit varying degrees of parental care by guarding the nest, releasing hatchlings from the nest and eggs, and transporting them to water in her mouth (Kushlan and Simon, 1981; Lang, 1987; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n Young may remain in a protective crèche with the mother and sometimes other adults for a considerable length of time, sometimes exceeding a year (Lang, 1987, 1989; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n American alligators are subject to a variety of state and federal regulations (Levell, 1997); they should not be obtained by anyone before such legislation is understood along the responsibility that goes with keeping them as captives.\nReferences \n(click for full references) Ashton, R.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the American Alligator.\n   - The location of interest is west of Texas (excluding Texas).\n   - The source of information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, with its indigenous range extending from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - This information would likely be found in historical records or reports from the USGS, particularly in sections detailing nonindigenous occurrences or range expansions.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are necessary based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, so it is reasonable to assume that any findings west of Texas would be relatively recent, possibly within the last century.\n   - The expansion of the alligator's range might be related to changes in habitat, climate, or human activity, but the exact year would need to be confirmed with historical data.\n   - Given the historical context and the known range of the American Alligator, it is plausible that the first recorded finding west of Texas occurred in the 1960s, as mentioned in the initial search results. This aligns with the expansion of the species' range due to various factors such as habitat changes and human introductions.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The initial search results from the USGS website and other sources suggested that the American Alligator was first found west of Texas in the 1960s. This aligns with the known historical context of the species' range expansion and the potential for human introductions.\n- The 1960s is a reasonable timeframe for such an occurrence, considering the environmental and human factors that could have facilitated the movement of alligators beyond their traditional range.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Continue to search for more detailed reports or specific historical records on the USGS website or other reliable sources to confirm the exact year.\n- If the 1960s reference is accurate, look for specific documents or articles that provide more precise details about the first sightings.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Lack of Specificity in Searches**: The initial searches were too broad and did not focus on the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n2. **Inefficient Navigation**: The web surfing was not systematic, and we did not efficiently navigate through the USGS website to find the relevant information.\n3. **Missed Key Sections**: We missed key sections on the USGS website that might contain the specific year, such as detailed historical records or nonindigenous occurrences.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refined Web Search**:\n   - Perform a more targeted web search using specific keywords to find the exact year.\n   - Search query: \"USGS American Alligator first found west of Texas year 1960s\" to narrow down the results.\n\n2. **Systematic Navigation**:\n   - Navigate directly to the \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\" section on the USGS website.\n   - Scroll through the table to find entries for states west of Texas.\n\n3. **Detailed Examination**:\n   - Click on hyperlinks for specific states and years to access detailed records.\n   - Look for any mentions of the first recorded sightings of American Alligators in those states.\n\n4. **Cross-Verification**:\n   - Cross-verify the information found with other reliable sources, such as academic papers or historical records.\n\n5. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - Once the specific year is identified, summarize the key details and provide the answer.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Perform a Targeted Web Search**:\n   - Search query: \"USGS American Alligator first found west of Texas year 1960s\"\n\n2. **Navigate to the USGS Website**:\n   - Go to the [Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221).\n   - Scroll to the \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\" section.\n\n3. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Look for states west of Texas (e.g., Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona).\n   - Note the earliest year of observation for each state.\n\n4. **Click on Hyperlinks**:\n   - Click on the hyperlinks for the earliest years to access detailed records.\n   - Look for any mentions of the first recorded sightings of American Alligators in those states.\n\n5. **Cross-Verify Information**:\n   - Check other reliable sources for confirmation.\n   - Use academic papers or historical records if necessary.\n\n6. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - Provide the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - Include any additional relevant details.\n\nBy following this new plan, we aim to efficiently and systematically find the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas, avoiding the previous issues of broad searches and inefficient navigation."}

The earliest records of alligators in Texas date back to the 19th century, with reports indicating their presence in the lower Rio Grande Valley, including Brownsville, as early as the 1850s. This suggests that alligators were likely indigenous to this area rather than introduced. 2\nPopulation Recovery: After facing significant declines due to habitat loss and hunting, the American alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967. Conservation efforts, including legal protections and habitat restoration, allowed their populations to rebound significantly. By the 1980s, alligators were once again thriving in many parts of their historical range, including Texas. 1\nCurrent Status: Today, the American alligator is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem, playing a crucial role in maintaining the health of wetland habitats. Their presence in areas west of Texas, particularly in the Rio Grande Valley, is now well-established, and they are monitored as part of ongoing conservation efforts.

American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998).\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"og:site_name\": \"USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221\",\n        \"og:title\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/XIMAGESERVERX/2019/20190613131315.JPG\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Species summary for American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis)\",\n        \"Description\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The alligators spotted in Essex County, New Jersey, may have escaped a lagoon in Military Park, Newark (Anonymous in Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n Perhaps they had been part of a public animal display.\n The \nA. mississippiensis collected from Mesa County, Colorado, escaped from a roadside zoo (Livo et al., 1998), while the one collected from the Colorado River in California had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978).\n Conant (1977) suggested that an animal dealer intentionally established the \nA. mississippiensis population found in the Brownsville area of Cameron County, Texas.\nStatus: All the American alligators found in New York have been collected (Anderson and Habuda, 2001; Anonymous, 2001a, b; Beebe, 2001c; Heaton-Jones, 2001; Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). They are not established in this state nor could they survive the cold winters, and the story of alligators dwelling in New York City sewers is simply a well-entrenched myth (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). One of the alligators found in Union County, New Jersey, was collected; although there is no further word about the success of the 1933 great gator hunt started on the Passaic River in Essex County (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n All \nA. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).\n Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous \nA. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are \"thriving.\" There is no evidence of reproduction.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "WebSurfer", "content": "I scrolled down one page in the browser.\n\nThe web browser is open to the page [American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221).\nThe viewport shows 16% of the webpage, and is positioned 61% down from the top of the page\nThe following text is visible in the viewport:\n\nAll \nA. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).\n Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous \nA. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are \"thriving.\" There is no evidence of reproduction.\n There is a possibility that introduced American alligators in Oklahoma may establish populations in or near the southeastern corner of the state; thus interacting with indigenous populations in this region ([Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]).\n The \nA. mississippiensis populations in the Brownsville area, Cameron County, and the surrounding lower Rio Grande Valley are established but some authors suggest they could be nonindigenous (Conant, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998).\n Since alligators were reported from the Brownsville region before the presumptive introductions took place (Baird, 1859), they are probably indigenous (Ross and Ernst, 1994).\n Indigenous populations may have simply been augmented by intentional introductions (Conant, 1977).\n The \nA. mississippiensis in Boulder, Colorado, was collected (Livo et al., 1998).\n Only one of the American alligators was collected from the Colorado River, Mesa County, Colorado; the other was never recaptured, but there is no evidence of an established population (Livo et al., 1998).\n The American alligators from Phoenix, Arizona, were collected (M. Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as \"not well established\" in Arizona.\nImpact of Introduction: There is no evidence that any of the nonindigenous occurrences of American alligators have had any impact on indigenous ecosystems; however, an established population of these massive carnivores in a southwestern state could negatively impact indigenous fauna. The introductions in Oklahoma, and the presumptive introduction in Cameron County, Texas, could compromise the genetic integrity of extant indigenous populations. As mentioned above, the status of indigenous alligators in Oklahoma could be obfuscated, thus creating difficulties when deciding conservation measures and future protective legislation. A large alligator is a potentially dangerous carnivore.\n While attacks on humans are exceedingly rare, they do occur on occasion (Pooley et al., 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Anonymous, 2002).\nRemarks: The taxonomy of A. mississippiensis has been reviewed or summarized by Smith and Smith (1977), King (1989), Ross and Ernst (1994), and Crother et al. (2000). Liner (1994) provides a Spanish vernacular name for the American alligator.  Brisbin et al. (1986), Gibbons and Semlitsch (1991), and Ross and Ernst (1994) provide the best literature reviews of the natural history of alligators. A variety of authors have contributed to or summarized the natural history and biology of American alligators (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973, 1976; Mount, 1975; Lang, 1987, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Vliet, 1989; and a variety of contributions compiled by Webb et al., 1987). Scientific and standard English names follow Crother (2008).Alligator mississippiensis is an aquatic, omnicarnivorous reptile capable of living in many types of waterways, both natural and man-made, and feeding upon almost any fauna it can catch (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Mount, 1975; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Some alligators dig deep holes with connecting dens than can remain filled with water during droughts, thus maintaining an aquatic environment for indigenous fauna (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Grenard, 1991).\n Courtship and mating involves complex visual and auditory displays directed at prospective mates and competitors (McIlhenny, 1935; Lang, 1987, 1989; Vliet, 1989).\n The female buries her hard-shelled eggs in a nest she constructs of dead vegetation and the surrounding muck (McIlhenny, 1935; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Females exhibit varying degrees of parental care by guarding the nest, releasing hatchlings from the nest and eggs, and transporting them to water in her mouth (Kushlan and Simon, 1981; Lang, 1987; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n Young may remain in a protective crèche with the mother and sometimes other adults for a considerable length of time, sometimes exceeding a year (Lang, 1987, 1989; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n American alligators are subject to a variety of state and federal regulations (Levell, 1997); they should not be obtained by anyone before such legislation is understood along the responsibility that goes with keeping them as captives.\nReferences \n(click for full references) Ashton, R.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the American Alligator.\n   - The location of interest is west of Texas (excluding Texas).\n   - The source of information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, with its indigenous range extending from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma.\n   - According to the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database, the American Alligator has been observed in several states outside its indigenous range, including states west of Texas.\n   - The earliest recorded nonindigenous observation of the American Alligator in Oklahoma, which is west of Texas, was in 1970.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Confirm if there are any earlier records of American Alligators being found in states west of Texas.\n   - Verify if there are any other states west of Texas with earlier records of nonindigenous American Alligators.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determine if the 1970 record in Oklahoma is the earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, so it is reasonable to assume that any findings west of Texas would be relatively recent, possibly within the last century.\n   - The expansion of the alligator's range might be related to changes in habitat, climate, or human activity, but the exact year would need to be confirmed with historical data.\n   - Given the historical context and the known range of the American Alligator, it is plausible that the first recorded finding west of Texas occurred in the 1970s. This aligns with the expansion of the species' range due to various factors such as habitat changes and human introductions.\n   - The 1970 record in Oklahoma is currently the earliest known nonindigenous observation west of Texas, but it is important to verify if there are any earlier records in other states.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The USGS NAS database provides a reliable source of information on nonindigenous occurrences of the American Alligator.\n- The 1970 record in Oklahoma is the earliest we have found so far, but it is essential to check other states west of Texas to ensure there are no earlier records.\n- The 1970s is a reasonable timeframe for the first recorded finding of American Alligators west of Texas, considering the environmental and human factors that could have facilitated their movement beyond their traditional range.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Verify Oklahoma Record**:\n   - Confirm the 1970 record in Oklahoma by examining the detailed records and references provided in the USGS NAS database.\n   \n2. **Check Other States**:\n   - Examine the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' table for other states west of Texas, such as New Mexico and Arizona, to see if there are any earlier records.\n   \n3. **Cross-Verify Information**:\n   - Cross-verify the information found with other reliable sources, such as academic papers or historical records, to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - Once the specific year is identified, summarize the key details and provide the answer.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to efficiently and systematically find the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas, ensuring that we have a comprehensive and accurate answer.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Navigation**:\n   - The web surfing was not systematic, and we did not efficiently navigate through the USGS website to find the relevant information.\n   - We did not focus on the specific section of the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' table that lists states west of Texas.\n\n2. **Lack of Verification**:\n   - We did not verify the 1970 record in Oklahoma by examining the detailed records and references provided in the USGS NAS database.\n   - We did not check other states west of Texas, such as New Mexico and Arizona, to ensure there were no earlier records.\n\n3. **Repetition of Searches**:\n   - We repeated the same search queries without refining them to focus on the specific information needed.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refined Web Search**:\n   - Perform a targeted web search using specific keywords to find the exact year.\n   - Search query: \"USGS American Alligator first found west of Texas year 1970s\".\n\n2. **Systematic Navigation**:\n   - Navigate directly to the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database.\n   - Scroll to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section and focus on states west of Texas (e.g., Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona).\n\n3. **Detailed Examination**:\n   - Click on the hyperlinks for the earliest years of observation in each state to access detailed records.\n   - Note the specific year and any additional details.\n\n4. **Cross-Verification**:\n   - Cross-verify the information found with other reliable sources, such as academic papers or historical records, if necessary.\n\n5. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - Provide the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - Include any additional relevant details.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Perform a Targeted Web Search**:\n   - Search query: \"USGS American Alligator first found west of Texas year 1970s\".\n\n2. **Navigate to the USGS NAS Database**:\n   - Go to the [Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221).\n   - Scroll to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section.\n\n3. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Focus on states west of Texas (e.g., Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona).\n   - Note the earliest year of observation for each state.\n\n4. **Click on Hyperlinks**:\n   - Click on the hyperlinks for the earliest years of observation to access detailed records.\n   - Look for any mentions of the first recorded sightings of American Alligators in those states.\n\n5. **Cross-Verify Information**:\n   - Check other reliable sources for confirmation if necessary.\n   - Use academic papers or historical records if needed.\n\n6. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - Provide the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - Include any additional relevant details.\n\nBy following this new plan, we aim to efficiently and systematically find the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas, avoiding the previous issues of inefficient navigation and lack of verification."}

Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"og:site_name\": \"USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221\",\n        \"og:title\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/XIMAGESERVERX/2019/20190613131315.JPG\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Species summary for American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis)\",\n        \"Description\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the American Alligator.\n   - The location of interest is west of Texas (excluding Texas).\n   - The source of information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, with its indigenous range extending from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma.\n   - According to the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database, the American Alligator has been observed in several states outside its indigenous range, including states west of Texas.\n   - The earliest recorded nonindigenous observation of the American Alligator in Oklahoma, which is west of Texas, was in 1970.\n   - The earliest recorded nonindigenous observation of the American Alligator in Arizona, which is west of Texas, was in 1990.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Confirm if there are any earlier records of American Alligators being found in states west of Texas.\n   - Verify if there are any other states west of Texas with earlier records of nonindigenous American Alligators, particularly New Mexico.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determine if the 1970 record in Oklahoma is the earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, so it is reasonable to assume that any findings west of Texas would be relatively recent, possibly within the last century.\n   - The expansion of the alligator's range might be related to changes in habitat, climate, or human activity, but the exact year would need to be confirmed with historical data.\n   - Given the historical context and the known range of the American Alligator, it is plausible that the first recorded finding west of Texas occurred in the 1970s. This aligns with the expansion of the species' range due to various factors such as habitat changes and human introductions.\n   - The 1970 record in Oklahoma is currently the earliest known nonindigenous observation west of Texas, but it is important to verify if there are any earlier records in other states, particularly New Mexico.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The USGS NAS database provides a reliable source of information on nonindigenous occurrences of the American Alligator.\n- The 1970 record in Oklahoma is the earliest we have found so far, but it is essential to check other states west of Texas to ensure there are no earlier records.\n- The 1970s is a reasonable timeframe for the first recorded finding of American Alligators west of Texas, considering the environmental and human factors that could have facilitated their movement beyond their traditional range.\n- New Mexico, being another state west of Texas, should be checked to ensure there are no earlier records.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Verify Oklahoma Record**:\n   - Confirm the 1970 record in Oklahoma by examining the detailed records and references provided in the USGS NAS database.\n   \n2. **Check Other States**:\n   - Examine the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' table for other states west of Texas, particularly New Mexico, to see if there are any earlier records.\n   \n3. **Cross-Verify Information**:\n   - Cross-verify the information found with other reliable sources, such as academic papers or historical records, to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - Once the specific year is identified, summarize the key details and provide the answer.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to efficiently and systematically find the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas, ensuring that we have a comprehensive and accurate answer.\n\n### Action Items\n1. **Navigate to the USGS NAS Database**:\n   - Go to the [Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221).\n   - Scroll to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section.\n   - Focus on states west of Texas, particularly New Mexico.\n\n2. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Note the earliest year of observation for New Mexico.\n   - Click on the hyperlinks for detailed records if necessary.\n\n3. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - Provide the specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - Include any additional relevant details.\n\nPlease proceed with the next steps to gather the required information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues**:\n   - The web surfer repeatedly navigated back to the same page (Arizona collections) instead of returning to the main 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' table.\n   - There was a lack of systematic navigation to ensure we were focusing on the correct sections of the webpage.\n\n2. **Inefficient Data Collection**:\n   - The web surfer did not systematically collect and verify data for all relevant states (e.g., New Mexico, Oklahoma).\n   - There was a lack of clear instructions to ensure the web surfer focused on the specific information needed.\n\n3. **Lack of Confirmation**:\n   - The web surfer did not confirm the earliest records for each state by clicking on the hyperlinks for detailed records.\n   - There was no cross-verification of the data with other reliable sources.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Main Page**:\n   - Ensure the web surfer is on the main 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' page of the USGS NAS database for the American Alligator.\n   - URL: https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221\n\n2. **Focus on Relevant States**:\n   - Scroll to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section.\n   - Identify and note the earliest year of observation for states west of Texas (e.g., Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona).\n\n3. **Collect Detailed Records**:\n   - Click on the hyperlinks for the earliest years of observation for each state to access detailed records.\n   - Note any additional details and references.\n\n4. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - Summarize the earliest year of observation for each state.\n   - Determine the overall earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas.\n\n5. **Cross-Verify Information**:\n   - If necessary, cross-verify the information with other reliable sources, such as academic papers or historical records.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Main Page**:\n   - Open the USGS NAS database for the American Alligator: https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221\n\n2. **Scroll to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' table.\n\n3. **Identify and Note Earliest Observations**:\n   - For Oklahoma:\n     - Note the earliest year of observation.\n     - Click on the hyperlink for detailed records.\n   - For New Mexico:\n     - Note the earliest year of observation.\n     - Click on the hyperlink for detailed records.\n   - For Arizona:\n     - Note the earliest year of observation.\n     - Click on the hyperlink for detailed records.\n\n4. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - Summarize the earliest year of observation for each state.\n   - Determine the overall earliest year the American Alligator was found west of Texas.\n\n5. **Cross-Verify Information**:\n   - If necessary, cross-verify the information with other reliable sources.\n\n### Example Commands\n\n1. **Navigate to the Main Page**:\n   ```sh\n   web_surfer.navigate_to(\"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Scroll to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' Section**:\n   ```sh\n   web_surfer.scroll_to_section(\"Nonindigenous Occurrences\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Identify and Note Earliest Observations**:\n   - For Oklahoma:\n     ```sh\n     web_surfer.click_link(\"Oklahoma\")\n     web_surfer.extract_text(\"Earliest Year of Observation\")\n     web_surfer.click_back()\n     ```\n   - For New Mexico:\n     ```sh\n     web_surfer.click_link(\"New Mexico\")\n     web_surfer.extract_text(\"Earliest Year of Observation\")\n     web_surfer.click_back()\n     ```\n   -

American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998).\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"og:site_name\": \"USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221\",\n        \"og:title\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/XIMAGESERVERX/2019/20190613131315.JPG\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Species summary for American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis)\",\n        \"Description\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
