It blew out a huge bi-lobed bubble that blasted through the interstellar medium in two directions. Whatever it was, it released huge amounts of energy from the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A\n (Sgr A for short).\nThese bubbles contain weird, spindly one-dimensional vertical filaments that emit radio signals of their own. In 1984, astronomer Farhad Yusef-Zadeh at Northwestern University and his collaborators were \nthe first to observe these wispy trails. Now, they know of more than a thousand of them. They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

One idea is that they are the result of jets of material being ejected from the supermassive black hole. Another is that they formed due to magnetic fields in the region. Yet another suggests that they are the remnants of supernova explosions.\nWhatever the cause, the filaments are fascinating objects to study. They could hold clues to the history and evolution of the galactic center, as well as the processes that govern the behavior of matter near supermassive black holes.\nIn the meantime, astronomers continue to observe the filaments and gather more data. The MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa, which has been instrumental in making these observations, will continue to play a key role in unraveling the mysteries of the galactic center.\nThe Population of the Galactic Center Filaments: Position Angle Distribution Reveals a Degree-scale Collimated Outflow from Sgr A* along the Galactic Plane\nThis research was supported by NASA under award numbers NNX17AG23G and 80NSSC21K0529.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
