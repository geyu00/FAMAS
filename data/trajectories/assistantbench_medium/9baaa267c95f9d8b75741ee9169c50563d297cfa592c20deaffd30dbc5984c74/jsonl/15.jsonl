{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nBased on recent years (2020-2023), how likely am I to hit a day with a max temperature (in Fahrenheit) over 95 if I travel to Houston, Texas during June? (provide the answer in percentage)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The time frame of interest is from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The location of interest is Houston, Texas.\n   - The month of interest is June.\n   - The temperature threshold of interest is 95°F.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical weather data for Houston, Texas, specifically the maximum temperatures for each day in June from 2020 to 2023.\n   - Sources: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Weather Underground, or local meteorological services.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F.\n   - The total number of days in June from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, Houston, Texas, is known for its hot summers, and it is likely that a significant portion of June days exceed 95°F.\n   - A rough estimate might place the likelihood at around 50% to 70%, but this is speculative and needs verification with actual data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Gather Historical Weather Data**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for historical weather data for Houston, Texas, specifically for the month of June from 2020 to 2023. Use sources like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Weather Underground, or local meteorological services.\n  \n- **Step 2: Extract Relevant Data**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Extract the daily maximum temperatures for each June from 2020 to 2023. Save this data in a structured format (e.g., CSV).\n\n- **Step 3: Process and Analyze Data**\n  - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to read the extracted data, count the number of days where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F, and calculate the total number of days in June from 2020 to 2023.\n  - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script provided by the Assistant to process the data.\n\n- **Step 4: Calculate the Percentage**\n  - **Assistant**: Use the results from the Python script to calculate the percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F.\n\n- **Step 5: Present the Results**\n  - **Assistant**: Provide the final percentage and any additional insights or context as needed."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nBased on recent years (2020-2023), how likely am I to hit a day with a max temperature (in Fahrenheit) over 95 if I travel to Houston, Texas during June? (provide the answer in percentage)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The time frame of interest is from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The location of interest is Houston, Texas.\n   - The month of interest is June.\n   - The temperature threshold of interest is 95°F.\n   - We have accessed the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) page for Houston Intercontinental Airport (USW00012960) and Sugar Land 1.1 WSW, TX US (US1TXFB0005).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical weather data for Houston, Texas, specifically the maximum temperatures for each day in June from 2020 to 2023.\n     - **Sources**: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Weather Underground, or local meteorological services.\n   - Ensure the data is extracted and saved in a structured format, such as a CSV file, for both Houston Intercontinental Airport and Sugar Land 1.1 WSW.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F for both locations.\n   - The total number of days in June from 2020 to 2023 for both locations.\n   - The percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F for both locations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, Houston, Texas, is known for its hot summers, and it is likely that a significant portion of June days exceed 95°F.\n   - A rough estimate might place the likelihood at around 50% to 70%, but this is speculative and needs verification with actual data.\n   - **New Guess**: Given that we are focusing on Houston Intercontinental Airport and Sugar Land 1.1 WSW, both of which are in the greater Houston area, the data from these two locations should provide a comprehensive view of the temperature trends. It is reasonable to expect that the data from these two stations will be similar due to their proximity and shared climate conditions.\n   - **Reasoning**: Houston is a large urban area with a consistent climate pattern. Both Houston Intercontinental Airport and Sugar Land are within the same climate zone, so the temperature data should be fairly consistent between the two. This increases the reliability of our final percentage calculation.\n\nLet's proceed with extracting the data for both locations and then move on to processing and analyzing it.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Repetitive Actions**: The WebSurfer repeatedly clicked on the wrong data access link (Sugar Land 1.1 WSW) instead of the correct one (Houston Intercontinental Airport).\n2. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions did not clearly specify which exact link to click, leading to confusion and incorrect data extraction.\n3. **Inadequate Verification**: There was no step to verify that the correct data was being accessed and extracted.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Clarify the Target Location**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) page for Houston, Texas.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Clearly specify to click on the \"Access Data\" link for **HOUSTON INTERCONTINENTAL AIRPORT, TX US (USW00012960)**.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Each June from 2020 to 2023**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023):\n     - Set the date range to June 1 to June 30.\n     - Extract the daily maximum temperatures.\n     - Save the data in a structured format (CSV file).\n\n3. **Verify Data Extraction**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the data extracted is for the correct location and date range.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the CSV file contains the expected columns (date, maximum temperature).\n\n4. **Process and Analyze Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to read the CSV file, count the number of days where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F, and calculate the total number of days in June from 2020 to 2023.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script provided by the Assistant to process the data.\n\n5. **Calculate the Percentage**:\n   - **Assistant**: Use the results from the Python script to calculate the percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F.\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final percentage and any additional insights or context as needed.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to NCEI Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the NCEI page for Houston, Texas.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Access Data\" for **HOUSTON INTERCONTINENTAL AIRPORT, TX US (USW00012960)**.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Each Year**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023):\n     - Set the date range to June 1 to June 30.\n     - Extract the daily maximum temperatures.\n     - Save the data in a CSV file named `houston_intercontinental_YYYY.csv` (replace YYYY with the year).\n\n3. **Verify Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the CSV files contain the correct data for the specified location and date range.\n\n4. **Process Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Write the following Python script to process the data:\n     ```python\n     import pandas as pd\n\n     # List of CSV files for each year\n     csv_files = [\n         'houston_intercontinental_2020.csv',\n         'houston_intercontinental_2021.csv',\n         'houston_intercontinental_2022.csv',\n         'houston_intercontinental_2023.csv'\n     ]\n\n     # Initialize counters\n     total_days = 0\n     hot_days = 0\n\n     for file in csv_files:\n         df = pd.read_csv(file)\n         total_days += len(df)\n         hot_days += (df['Max Temp'] > 95).sum()\n\n     # Calculate the percentage\n     percentage_hot_days = (hot_days / total_days) * 100\n\n     print(f\"Total days in June from 2020 to 2023: {total_days}\")\n     print(f\"Days with max temperature over 95°F: {hot_days}\")\n     print(f\"Percentage of days with max temperature over 95°F: {percentage_hot_days:.2f}%\")\n     ```\n\n5. **Run the Script**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script provided by the Assistant.\n     ```sh\n     python3 process_houston_data.py\n     ```\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final percentage and any additional insights or context as needed."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nBased on recent years (2020-2023), how likely am I to hit a day with a max temperature (in Fahrenheit) over 95 if I travel to Houston, Texas during June? (provide the answer in percentage)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The time frame of interest is from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The location of interest is Houston, Texas.\n   - The month of interest is June.\n   - The temperature threshold of interest is 95°F.\n   - We have accessed the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) page for Houston Intercontinental Airport (USW00012960).\n   - Houston Intercontinental Airport (USW00012960) has complete data coverage from 1969 to present.\n   - The latitude and longitude of Houston Intercontinental Airport are 29.98438°, -95.36072°.\n   - The elevation of Houston Intercontinental Airport is 27.5 meters.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical weather data for Houston, Texas, specifically the maximum temperatures for each day in June from 2020 to 2023.\n     - **Sources**: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Weather Underground, or local meteorological services.\n   - Ensure the data is extracted and saved in a structured format, such as a CSV file, for Houston Intercontinental Airport.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F at Houston Intercontinental Airport.\n   - The total number of days in June from 2020 to 2023 at Houston Intercontinental Airport.\n   - The percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F at Houston Intercontinental Airport.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, Houston, Texas, is known for its hot summers, and it is likely that a significant portion of June days exceed 95°F.\n   - A rough estimate might place the likelihood at around 50% to 70%, but this is speculative and needs verification with actual data.\n   - **New Guess**: Given that we are focusing on Houston Intercontinental Airport, which is a major airport with reliable and consistent weather data, the data from this location should provide a robust and accurate representation of the temperature trends in Houston.\n   - **Reasoning**: Houston Intercontinental Airport is located in a central part of the city and is equipped with high-quality meteorological instruments, ensuring that the data collected is reliable and representative of the broader Houston area. This increases the confidence in the final percentage calculation.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to NCEI Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the NCEI page for Houston, Texas.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Access Data\" for **HOUSTON INTERCONTINENTIAL AIRPORT, TX US (USW00012960)**.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Each Year**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023):\n     - Set the date range to June 1 to June 30.\n     - Extract the daily maximum temperatures.\n     - Save the data in a CSV file named `houston_intercontinental_YYYY.csv` (replace YYYY with the year).\n\n3. **Verify Data Extraction**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the CSV files contain the correct data for the specified location and date range.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the CSV file contains the expected columns (date, maximum temperature).\n\n4. **Process and Analyze Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to read the CSV file, count the number of days where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F, and calculate the total number of days in June from 2020 to 2023.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script provided by the Assistant to process the data.\n\n5. **Calculate the Percentage**:\n   - **Assistant**: Use the results from the Python script to calculate the percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F.\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final percentage and any additional insights or context as needed.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to NCEI Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the NCEI page for Houston, Texas.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Access Data\" for **HOUSTON INTERCONTINENTIAL AIRPORT, TX US (USW00012960)**.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Each Year**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023):\n     - Set the date range to June 1 to June 30.\n     - Extract the daily maximum temperatures.\n     - Save the data in a CSV file named `houston_intercontinental_YYYY.csv` (replace YYYY with the year).\n\n3. **Verify Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the CSV files contain the correct data for the specified location and date range.\n\n4. **Process Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Write the following Python script to process the data:\n     ```python\n     import pandas as pd\n\n     # List of CSV files for each year\n     csv_files = [\n         'houston_intercontinental_2020.csv',\n         'houston_intercontinental_2021.csv',\n         'houston_intercontinental_2022.csv',\n         'houston_intercontinental_2023.csv'\n     ]\n\n     # Initialize counters\n     total_days = 0\n     hot_days = 0\n\n     for file in csv_files:\n         df = pd.read_csv(file)\n         total_days += len(df)\n         hot_days += (df['Max Temp'] > 95).sum()\n\n     # Calculate the percentage\n     percentage_hot_days = (hot_days / total_days) * 100\n\n     print(f\"Total days in June from 2020 to 2023: {total_days}\")\n     print(f\"Days with max temperature over 95°F: {hot_days}\")\n     print(f\"Percentage of days with max temperature over 95°F: {percentage_hot_days:.2f}%\")\n     ```\n\n5. **Run the Script**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script provided by the Assistant.\n     ```sh\n     python3 process_houston_data.py\n     ```\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final percentage and any additional insights or context as needed.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the NCEI page for Houston Intercontinental Airport (USW00012960) and extract the data for June 2020.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Repeat the extraction process for June 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Verify that the CSV files contain the correct data.\n4. **Assistant**: Write and run the Python script to process the data and calculate the percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Data Range Selection**:\n   - The WebSurfer did not correctly set the date range to June 1 to June 30 for the specified years.\n   - The WebSurfer may have missed the specific fields or buttons needed to set the date range.\n\n2. **Lack of Clear Instructions**:\n   - The instructions were not detailed enough to guide the WebSurfer through the specific steps required to set the date range and extract the data.\n\n3. **Verification Step Missing**:\n   - There was no step to verify that the data extracted was for the correct date range and location, leading to potential errors going unnoticed.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to NCEI Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the NCEI page for Houston, Texas.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Access Data\" for **HOUSTON INTERCONTINENTIAL AIRPORT, TX US (USW00012960)**.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Each Year**:\n   -

(provide the answer in percentage)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The time frame of interest is from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The location of interest is Houston, Texas.\n   - The month of interest is June.\n   - The temperature threshold of interest is 95°F.\n   - We have accessed the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) page for Houston Intercontinental Airport (USW00012960).\n   - Houston Intercontinental Airport (USW00012960) has complete data coverage from 1969 to present.\n   - The latitude and longitude of Houston Intercontinental Airport are 29.98438°, -95.36072°.\n   - The elevation of Houston Intercontinental Airport is 27.5 meters.\n   - The NCEI page for Houston Intercontinental Airport provides access to detailed historical weather data.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical weather data for Houston, Texas, specifically the maximum temperatures for each day in June from 2020 to 2023.\n     - **Sources**: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Weather Underground, or local meteorological services.\n   - Ensure the data is extracted and saved in a structured format, such as a CSV file, for Houston Intercontinental Airport.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F at Houston Intercontinental Airport.\n   - The total number of days in June from 2020 to 2023 at Houston Intercontinental Airport.\n   - The percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F at Houston Intercontinental Airport.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, Houston, Texas, is known for its hot summers, and it is likely that a significant portion of June days exceed 95°F.\n   - A rough estimate might place the likelihood at around 50% to 70%, but this is speculative and needs verification with actual data.\n   - **New Guess**: Given that we are focusing on Houston Intercontinental Airport, which is a major airport with reliable and consistent weather data, the data from this location should provide a robust and accurate representation of the temperature trends in Houston.\n   - **Reasoning**: Houston Intercontinental Airport is located in a central part of the city and is equipped with high-quality meteorological instruments, ensuring that the data collected is reliable and representative of the broader Houston area. This increases the confidence in the final percentage calculation.\n   - **Additional Guess**: The data extraction process from the NCEI page might require navigating through multiple steps, including setting the date range and downloading the data in CSV format. Ensuring that the correct date range (June 1 to June 30) is selected for each year is crucial for accurate data collection.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to NCEI Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the NCEI page for Houston, Texas.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Access Data\" for **HOUSTON INTERCONTINENTIAL AIRPORT, TX US (USW00012960)**.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Each Year**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023):\n     - Set the date range to June 1 to June 30.\n     - Ensure the \"Year\" field is set to the correct year.\n     - Click the \"View Data\" button.\n     - Download the data in CSV format and save it as `houston_intercontinental_YYYY.csv` (replace YYYY with the year).\n\n3. **Verify Data Extraction**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the CSV files contain the correct data for the specified location and date range.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check that the CSV files have the expected columns (date, maximum temperature).\n\n4. **Process and Analyze Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to read the CSV files, count the number of days where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F, and calculate the total number of days in June from 2020 to 2023.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script provided by the Assistant to process the data.\n\n5. **Calculate the Percentage**:\n   - **Assistant**: Use the results from the Python script to calculate the percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F.\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final percentage and any additional insights or context as needed.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to NCEI Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the NCEI page for Houston, Texas.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Access Data\" for **HOUSTON INTERCONTINENTIAL AIRPORT, TX US (USW00012960)**.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Each Year**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023):\n     - Set the \"Year\" field to the correct year.\n     - Set the \"Start Date\" to June 1.\n     - Set the \"End Date\" to June 30.\n     - Click the \"View Data\" button.\n     - Download the data in CSV format and save it as `houston_intercontinental_YYYY.csv` (replace YYYY with the year).\n\n3. **Verify Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the CSV files contain the correct data for the specified location and date range.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check that the CSV files have the expected columns (date, maximum temperature).\n\n4. **Process Data**:\n   - **Assistant**: Write the following Python script to process the data:\n     ```python\n     import pandas as pd\n\n     # List of CSV files for each year\n     csv_files = [\n         'houston_intercontinental_2020.csv',\n         'houston_intercontinental_2021.csv',\n         'houston_intercontinental_2022.csv',\n         'houston_intercontinental_2023.csv'\n     ]\n\n     # Initialize counters\n     total_days = 0\n     hot_days = 0\n\n     for file in csv_files:\n         df = pd.read_csv(file)\n         total_days += len(df)\n         hot_days += (df['Max Temp'] > 95).sum()\n\n     # Calculate the percentage\n     percentage_hot_days = (hot_days / total_days) * 100\n\n     print(f\"Total days in June from 2020 to 2023: {total_days}\")\n     print(f\"Days with max temperature over 95°F: {hot_days}\")\n     print(f\"Percentage of days with max temperature over 95°F: {percentage_hot_days:.2f}%\")\n     ```\n\n5. **Run the Script**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script provided by the Assistant.\n     ```sh\n     python3 process_houston_data.py\n     ```\n\n6. **Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final percentage and any additional insights or context as needed.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the NCEI page for Houston Intercontinental Airport (USW00012960) and extract the data for June 2020.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Repeat the extraction process for June 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Verify that the CSV files contain the correct data.\n4. **Assistant**: Write and run the Python script to process the data and calculate the percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to ensure we have the necessary data and can accurately calculate the percentage.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Data Range Selection**:\n   - The WebSurfer did not correctly set the date range to June 1 to June 30 for the specified years.\n   - The WebSurfer may have missed the specific fields or buttons needed to set the date range.\n\n2. **Lack of Clear Instructions**:\n   - The instructions were not detailed enough to guide the WebSurfer through the specific steps required to set the date range and extract the data.\n\n3. **Verification Step Missing**:\n   - There was no step to verify that the data extracted was for the correct date range and location, leading to potential errors going unnoticed.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to NCEI Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the NCEI page for Houston, Texas.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Access Data\" for **HOUSTON INTERCONTINENTIAL AIRPORT, TX US (USW00012960)**.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Each Year**:\n   -

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nGiven the 503 Service Unavailable error encountered when trying to access the NCEI page, we need to adjust our approach to obtain the required historical weather data for Houston, Texas. Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The time frame of interest is from 2020 to 2023.\n   - The location of interest is Houston, Texas.\n   - The month of interest is June.\n   - The temperature threshold of interest is 95°F.\n   - The NCEI page for Houston Intercontinental Airport (USW00012960) is currently experiencing a 503 Service Unavailable error.\n   - Houston Intercontinental Airport (USW00012960) has complete data coverage from 1969 to present.\n   - The latitude and longitude of Houston Intercontinental Airport are 29.98438°, -95.36072°.\n   - The elevation of Houston Intercontinental Airport is 27.5 meters.\n   - The NCEI page for Houston Intercontinental Airport typically provides access to detailed historical weather data.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical weather data for Houston, Texas, specifically the maximum temperatures for each day in June from 2020 to 2023.\n     - **Sources**: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Weather Underground, or local meteorological services.\n   - Ensure the data is extracted and saved in a structured format, such as a CSV file, for Houston Intercontinental Airport.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of days in June from 2020 to 2023 where the maximum temperature exceeded 95°F at Houston Intercontinental Airport.\n   - The total number of days in June from 2020 to 2023 at Houston Intercontinental Airport.\n   - The percentage of days with a maximum temperature over 95°F at Houston Intercontinental Airport.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, Houston, Texas, is known for its hot summers, and it is likely that a significant portion of June days exceed 95°F.\n   - A rough estimate might place the likelihood at around 50% to 70%, but this is speculative and needs verification with actual data.\n   - **New Guess**: Given the current unavailability of the NCEI page, alternative sources such as Weather Underground or local meteorological services might provide the necessary historical weather data.\n   - **Reasoning**: These alternative sources often have comprehensive historical weather data and may offer a user-friendly interface for extracting the required information.\n   - **Additional Guess**: The data extraction process from alternative sources might also require navigating through multiple steps, including setting the date range and downloading the data in CSV format. Ensuring that the correct date range (June 1 to June 30) is selected for each year is crucial for accurate data collection.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Find Alternative Data Source**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for alternative sources of historical weather data for Houston, Texas, such as Weather Underground or local meteorological services.\n   -
