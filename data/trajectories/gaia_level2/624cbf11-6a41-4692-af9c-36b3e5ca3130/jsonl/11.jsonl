These tools often store historical versions of web pages, which can be particularly useful for accessing content that is no longer directly available.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Access Issues:** The direct link to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page resulted in an \"Access Denied\" error, preventing us from accessing the necessary information.\n- **Ineffective Search Strategy:** The search for a cached version or alternative source did not yield a usable result, possibly due to the specific search terms or the lack of a direct link to a cached page.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Use the Wayback Machine Directly:**\n  - Navigate to the Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org).\n  - Search for the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page using the URL: https://www.benjerry.com/flavors/flavor-graveyard.\n  - Select a recent snapshot from the end of 2022 to ensure the content is up-to-date.\n\n- **Verify and Extract Information:**\n  - Once the page is loaded, identify the section or page that lists the flavors and their corresponding headstones.\n  - Locate the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n  - Examine the photo to find the headstone in the background and read the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name.\n\n- **Fallback to Google Cache:**\n  - If the Wayback Machine does not provide a usable snapshot, try searching for a cached version using Google's cache feature.\n  - Use the search term: `cache:https://www.benjerry.com/flavors/flavor-graveyard`.\n\n- **Document and Confirm:**\n  - Document the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background.\n  - Confirm the accuracy of the information and provide the final answer.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org).\n2. **WebSurfer**: Search for the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page using the URL: https://www.benjerry.com/flavors/flavor-graveyard.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Select a recent snapshot from the end of 2022.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Identify the section or page that lists the flavors and their corresponding headstones.\n5. **WebSurfer**: Locate the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n6. **WebSurfer**: Examine the photo to find the headstone in the background and read the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name.\n7. **WebSurfer**: If the Wayback Machine does not provide a usable snapshot, use Google's cache feature with the search term: `cache:https://www.benjerry.com/flavors/flavor-graveyard`.\n8. **WebSurfer**: Document the last line of the rhyme and confirm the accuracy.\n9. **WebSurfer**: Provide the final answer."}

Established in 1997, the graveyard features granite headstones for flavors that have been retired, each with a clever epitaph and dates of birth and death. The graveyard began with just four flavors, including Dastardly Mash, Economic Crunch, Ethan Almond, and Tuskegee Chunk. Over the years, it has expanded to include many more flavors, with a total of around 35 flavors currently represented. Tasting Table\n+1\nDastardly Mash\nFlavor Profile: Dastardly Mash was a unique blend that combined various ingredients, making it a memorable offering during its time.\nDates: This flavor was one of the first to be retired, marking its headstone as the oldest in the graveyard. The exact dates of its introduction and retirement are often humorously inscribed on the headstone, reflecting the playful spirit of Ben & Jerry's branding.\nVisual Representation\nWhile I cannot provide a detailed photo from 2022, the headstone for Dastardly Mash, like others in the graveyard, features a granite marker with a witty epitaph that captures the essence of the flavor. Visitors to the graveyard can see these headstones during factory tours, which often include a narrative about the flavors and their stories.\nRead more\nThe Truth About Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard - Tasting Table\nBen & Jerry's created the Flavor Graveyard as a way for customers to mourn the loss of their favorite flavors that were no longer available in stores.

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The timeframe specified is as of the end of 2022.\n   - The direct link to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page is currently inaccessible due to an \"Access Denied\" error.\n   - The oldest flavor headstone in the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard commemorates the flavor \"Dastardly Mash,\" which was one of the original flavors interred when the graveyard opened in 1997.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A cached version or alternative source of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page.\n   - High-resolution images or detailed descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard, specifically focusing on the oldest flavor's headstone and the headstone visible in the background.\n   - The text on the headstone, specifically the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identification of which flavor is the oldest based on the information available on the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard. (Already identified as \"Dastardly Mash\")\n   - Confirmation that the headstone in the background of the photo corresponds to the oldest flavor.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard likely has a chronological order or some indication of when flavors were retired, which can help identify the oldest flavor. (Confirmed that \"Dastardly Mash\" is one of the oldest)\n   - The headstone in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone is probably part of a detailed image or gallery that includes multiple headstones.\n   - Given the access issues, the Wayback Machine or Google's cached pages might provide a reliable alternative to view the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard. (Still a valid approach, but we need to explore images and detailed descriptions as well)\n   - High-resolution images or detailed descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard from the end of 2022 might provide a clearer view of the headstones and the rhymes on them.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **High-Resolution Images and Detailed Descriptions:** Since direct access to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page is blocked, searching for high-resolution images or detailed descriptions from reputable sources can provide the necessary visual and textual information to identify the last line of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n- **Confirmation of Oldest Flavor:** We have confirmed that \"Dastardly Mash\" is one of the oldest flavors, which helps narrow down our search to images and descriptions that focus on this particular headstone and its surroundings.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **WebSurfer**: Continue searching for high-resolution images or detailed descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard, specifically focusing on the oldest flavor's headstone and the headstone visible in the background.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Look for any sources that provide a clear view or text of the rhymes on the headstones, particularly the last line of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Access Issues:** The direct link to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page resulted in an \"Access Denied\" error, preventing us from accessing the necessary information.\n- **Ineffective Search Strategy:** Initial attempts to use the Wayback Machine and Google's cache feature did not yield a usable result, possibly due to the specific search terms or the lack of a direct link to a cached page.\n- **Limited Image Search Results:** The image search did not provide high-resolution images or detailed descriptions that clearly showed the headstones and the rhymes on them.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Refine Search Terms:** Use more specific and targeted search terms to find high-resolution images or detailed descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n- **Utilize Multiple Sources:** Explore additional sources such as social media, blog posts, and articles that might have detailed images or descriptions of the flavor graveyard.\n- **Manual Verification:** Carefully examine the images and descriptions to identify the last line of the rhyme on the headstone in the background of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query: `\"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022 high-resolution images\"`.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Look for blog posts, articles, or social media posts that provide detailed images or descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard from the end of 2022.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Focus on finding images that show the oldest flavor's headstone (\"Dastardly Mash\") and the headstone in the background.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Carefully examine the images to identify the last line of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n5. **WebSurfer**: If high-resolution images are not available, look for detailed descriptions or transcriptions of the headstones from reliable sources.\n6. **WebSurfer**: Document the last line of the rhyme and confirm the accuracy.\n7. **WebSurfer**: Provide the final answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The timeframe specified is as of the end of 2022.\n   - The direct link to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page is currently inaccessible due to an \"Access Denied\" error.\n   - The oldest flavor headstone in the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard commemorates the flavor \"Dastardly Mash,\" which was one of the original flavors interred when the graveyard opened in 1997.\n   - The Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard features over 30 flavors, each represented by a real granite headstone. The tops of the gravestones have an icon of a cone with wings and a description of the flavor, while the base lists the birth and death dates. Each flavor is eulogized with a poetic epitaph.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A cached version or alternative source of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page.\n   - High-resolution images or detailed descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard, specifically focusing on the oldest flavor's headstone (\"Dastardly Mash\") and the headstone visible in the background.\n   - The text on the headstone, specifically the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Confirmation that the headstone in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone corresponds to another specific flavor.\n   - Identification of the exact wording of the last line of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard likely has a chronological order or some indication of when flavors were retired, which can help identify the oldest flavor. (Confirmed that \"Dastardly Mash\" is one of the oldest)\n   - The headstone in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone is probably part of a detailed image or gallery that includes multiple headstones.\n   - Given the access issues, the Wayback Machine or Google's cached pages might provide a reliable alternative to view the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard. (Still a valid approach, but we need to explore images and detailed descriptions as well)\n   - High-resolution images or detailed descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard from the end of 2022 might provide a clearer view of the headstones and the rhymes on them.\n   - Blog posts, articles, or social media posts from visitors to the Ben & Jerry's factory in Waterbury, Vermont, might contain detailed images or descriptions of the flavor graveyard, including the headstones and their inscriptions.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **High-Resolution Images and Detailed Descriptions:** Since direct access to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page is blocked, searching for high-resolution images or detailed descriptions from reputable sources can provide the necessary visual and textual information to identify the last line of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n- **Visitor Content:** Visitors to the Ben & Jerry's factory often share their experiences and photos online, which could include detailed images of the flavor graveyard and the headstones.\n- **Confirmation of Oldest Flavor:** We have confirmed that \"Dastardly Mash\" is one of the oldest flavors, which helps narrow down our search to images and descriptions that focus on this particular headstone and its surroundings.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **WebSurfer**: Continue searching for high-resolution images or detailed descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard, specifically focusing on the oldest flavor's headstone (\"Dastardly Mash\") and the headstone visible in the background.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Look for any sources that provide a clear view or text of the rhymes on the headstones, particularly the last line of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Explore blog posts, articles, or social media posts from visitors to the Ben & Jerry's factory in Waterbury, Vermont, for detailed images or descriptions of the flavor graveyard.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps to gather the necessary information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Ineffective Search Queries:** The search queries used were too broad and did not yield the specific high-resolution images or detailed descriptions needed.\n- **Lack of Focused Search:** The search did not specifically target content from visitors to the Ben & Jerry's factory, which might have included detailed images or descriptions of the flavor graveyard.\n- **Repetition of Searches:** The same type of search was repeated without significant variation, leading to redundant results.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Refine Search Queries:**\n   - Use more specific and targeted search terms to find detailed images or descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example queries: \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022 Dastardly Mash high-resolution image\", \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022 visitor photos\", \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022 detailed description\".\n\n2. **Target Visitor Content:**\n   - Focus on finding blog posts, articles, or social media posts from visitors to the Ben & Jerry's factory in Waterbury, Vermont.\n   - Example queries: \"Ben & Jerry's factory tour 2022 flavor graveyard photos\", \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard visit 2022\".\n\n3. **Explore Multiple Sources:**\n   - Check multiple search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) to ensure a comprehensive search.\n   - Look for user-generated content on platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and travel blogs.\n\n4. **Use Advanced Search Features:**\n   - Utilize advanced search features to filter results by date (e.g., \"2022\") and content type (e.g., images, videos).\n\n5. **Summarize and Extract Information:**\n   - Once relevant content is found, carefully examine the images and descriptions to identify the last line of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n   - Summarize the key details and extract the required information.\n\n### Steps:\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query: \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022 Dastardly Mash high-resolution image\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query: \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022 visitor photos\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query: \"Ben & Jerry's factory tour 2022 flavor graveyard photos\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query: \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard visit 2022\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Use advanced search features to filter results by date (2022) and content type (images, videos).\n- **WebSurfer**: Carefully examine the images and descriptions to identify the last line of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n- **WebSurfer**: Summarize the key details and extract the required information.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps to gather the necessary information."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The timeframe specified is as of the end of 2022.\n   - The direct link to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page is currently inaccessible due to an \"Access Denied\" error.\n   - The oldest flavor headstone in the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard commemorates the flavor \"Dastardly Mash,\" which was one of the original flavors interred when the graveyard opened in 1997.\n   - The Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard features over 30 flavors, each represented by a real granite headstone. The tops of the gravestones have an icon of a cone with wings and a description of the flavor, while the base lists the birth and death dates. Each flavor is eulogized with a poetic epitaph.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A cached version or alternative source of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard page.\n   - High-resolution images or detailed descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard, specifically focusing on the oldest flavor's headstone (\"Dastardly Mash\") and the headstone visible in the background.\n   - The text on the headstone, specifically the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Confirmation that the headstone in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone corresponds to another specific flavor.\n   - Identification of the exact wording of the last line of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard likely has a chronological order or some indication of when flavors were retired, which can help identify the oldest flavor. (Confirmed that \"Dastardly Mash\" is one of the oldest)\n   - The headstone in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone is probably part of a detailed image or gallery that includes multiple headstones.\n   - Given the access issues, the Wayback Machine or Google's cached pages might provide a reliable alternative to view the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard. (Still a valid approach, but we need to explore images and detailed descriptions as well)\n   - High-resolution images or detailed descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard from the end of 2022 might provide a clearer view of the headstones and the rhymes on them.\n   - Blog posts, articles, or social media posts from visitors to the Ben & Jerry's factory in Waterbury, Vermont, might contain detailed images or descriptions of the flavor graveyard, including the headstones and their inscriptions.\n\n**New Educated Guesses:**\n   - **Visitor Content on Social Media:** Visitors to the Ben & Jerry's factory often post detailed photos and descriptions on social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. These platforms might have user-generated content that includes high-resolution images of the flavor graveyard.\n   - **Travel Blogs and Review Sites:** Travel blogs and review sites like TripAdvisor, Yelp, and personal blogs might have detailed accounts and photos of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, especially from recent visits in 2022.\n   - **Local News and Community Websites:** Local news outlets and community websites in Vermont might have covered events or tours at the Ben & Jerry's factory, potentially including detailed images of the flavor graveyard.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Visitor Content on Social Media:** Social media platforms are rich sources of user-generated content, and visitors to the Ben & Jerry's factory often share their experiences and photos. This could provide high-resolution images and detailed descriptions of the flavor graveyard.\n- **Travel Blogs and Review Sites:** Travel blogs and review sites often feature detailed accounts of tourist attractions, including the Ben & Jerry's factory. These sources might have comprehensive descriptions and images of the flavor graveyard.\n- **Local News and Community Websites:** Local news and community websites are likely to cover events and activities at the Ben & Jerry's factory, providing additional sources of detailed images and descriptions.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query: 'Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022 visitor photos Dastardly Mash'. Use advanced search features to filter results by date (2022) and content type (images, videos).\n2. **WebSurfer**: Explore social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook for user-generated content related to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, focusing on recent posts from 2022.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Search travel blogs and review sites like TripAdvisor, Yelp, and personal blogs for detailed accounts and photos of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Check local news and community websites in Vermont for any coverage of the Ben & Jerry's factory, particularly focusing on the flavor graveyard.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps to gather the necessary information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Ineffective Search Queries:** The search queries used were too broad and did not yield the specific high-resolution images or detailed descriptions needed.\n- **Lack of Focused Search:** The search did not specifically target content from visitors to the Ben & Jerry's factory, which might have included detailed images or descriptions of the flavor graveyard.\n- **Repetition of Searches:** The same type of search was repeated without significant variation, leading to redundant results.\n- **Limited Exploration of Social Media and Travel Blogs:** There was insufficient exploration of social media platforms and travel blogs, which are rich sources of user-generated content.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Refine Search Queries:**\n   - Use more specific and targeted search terms to find detailed images or descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example queries: \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022 Dastardly Mash high-resolution image\", \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022 visitor photos Dastardly Mash\", \"Ben & Jerry's factory tour 2022 flavor graveyard photos Dastardly Mash\".\n\n2. **Target Visitor Content:**\n   - Focus on finding blog posts, articles, or social media posts from visitors to the Ben & Jerry's factory in Waterbury, Vermont.\n   - Example queries: \"Ben & Jerry's factory tour 2022 flavor graveyard photos\", \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard visit 2022 Dastardly Mash\".\n\n3. **Explore Multiple Sources:**\n   - Check multiple search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) to ensure a comprehensive search.\n   - Look for user-generated content on platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and travel blogs.\n\n4. **Use Advanced Search Features:**\n   - Utilize advanced search features to filter results by date (e.g., \"2022\") and content type (e.g., images, videos).\n\n5. **Summarize and Extract Information:**\n   - Once relevant content is found, carefully examine the images and descriptions to identify the last line of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n   - Summarize the key details and extract the required information.\n\n### Steps:\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query: \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022 Dastardly Mash high-resolution image\". Use advanced search features to filter results by date (2022) and content type (images, videos).\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query: \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022 visitor photos Dastardly Mash\".
