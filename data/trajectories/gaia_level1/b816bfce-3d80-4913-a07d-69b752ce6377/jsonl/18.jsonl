{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expresses distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of the journal (which is named after one of Hreidmar's sons).\n   - The specific word that was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The identities of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n   - The exact context in which the word was used in the article.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house (likely from Norse mythology).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The journal is likely related to Norse mythology, given the reference to Hreidmar's son.\n   - The word in question might be something like \"cliché,\" \"overdone,\" or \"fantastical,\" as these terms are often used to express distaste for common tropes in literature or media.\n   - The two authors quoted could be well-known fantasy or literary critics.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Name of Hreidmar's Son Who Guarded His House**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for information on Hreidmar's sons in Norse mythology to identify the son who guarded his house.\n  \n- **Locate the Journal Named After the Identified Son**\n  - Once the son's name is identified, use WebSurfer to find the journal named after him.\n\n- **Find Emily Midkiff's Article in the Journal**\n  - Use WebSurfer to locate the June 2014 issue of the journal and find Emily Midkiff's article.\n\n- **Extract the Quoted Word and Authors**\n  - Use WebSurfer to read through the article and identify the specific word quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n  - Note the identities of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n\n- **Verify and Summarize the Findings**\n  - Use WebSurfer to verify the extracted information and ensure accuracy.\n  - Summarize the findings, including the name of the journal, the word quoted, and the authors."}

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expresses distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - The journal is named \"Fafnir\" (verified from the search results).\n   - The article is titled \"Dragons are Tricksy\": The Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature.\n   - The article discusses the trend of softening and satirizing dragons in children's literature and argues that modern dragons still retain uncanny qualities from traditional lore.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific word that was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The identities of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n   - The exact context in which the word was used in the article.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house (Fafnir, as verified from the search results).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The word in question might be something like \"cliché,\" \"overdone,\" or \"fantastical,\" as these terms are often used to express distaste for common tropes in literature or media.\n   - The two authors quoted could be well-known fantasy or literary critics, possibly from the field of children's literature or mythology.\n   - Given the context of the article, the word might be related to the criticism of modern, softened dragon depictions in children's literature.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The article's focus on the uncanny qualities of dragons and the criticism of modern, softened depictions suggests that the word in question is likely a term used to express disappointment or dissatisfaction with how dragons are portrayed in contemporary children's literature.\n- The authors quoted are likely to be respected figures in the field of children's literature or mythology, as their opinions would carry weight in the context of the article.\n- The term \"cliché\" or \"overdone\" fits well with the theme of the article, as it aligns with the idea that modern dragon depictions have lost their mythic and archetypal power.\n\nNext steps:\n- Continue reading through the article to identify the specific word quoted from two different authors and the identities of those authors.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetition of Actions**: The previous attempts involved repeatedly clicking the \"Read Online\" link and scrolling down the page without actually extracting the necessary information.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions to WebSurfer were too general, leading to a lack of focused action on identifying the specific word and authors.\n- **Insufficient Context Extraction**: The previous runs did not extract enough context from the article to pinpoint the exact location of the word and the authors.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Open the Full Text of the Article**\n   - WebSurfer: Click the \"Read Online\" link to open the full text of Emily Midkiff's article in the June 2014 issue of Fafnir.\n\n2. **Scroll to the Relevant Section**\n   - WebSurfer: Scroll down the page to the section where the article discusses the criticism of dragon depictions. Look for phrases like \"scholars of children's literature have noted a trend to soften and satirize the dragon for children.\"\n\n3. **Identify the Quoted Word and Authors**\n   - WebSurfer: Carefully read through the section to find the specific word quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions. Note the identities of the two authors.\n\n4. **Extract the Exact Context**\n   - WebSurfer: Extract the exact context in which the word is used, including the surrounding sentences.\n\n5. **Summarize the Findings**\n   - WebSurfer: Summarize the findings, including the name of the journal, the word quoted, and the identities of the two authors.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Open the Full Text of the Article**\n   - WebSurfer: Click the \"Read Online\" link on the page [“Dragons are Tricksy”: The Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature – DOAJ](https://doaj.org/article/da917ab29a404237890e3eb998e93d0d).\n\n2. **Scroll to the Relevant Section**\n   - WebSurfer: Scroll down the page to find the section discussing the criticism of dragon depictions. Look for phrases like \"scholars of children's literature have noted a trend to soften and satirize the dragon for children.\"\n\n3. **Identify the Quoted Word and Authors**\n   - WebSurfer: Read through the section to find the specific word quoted from two different authors. Note the identities of the two authors. For example, look for sentences like \"Author X and Author Y both describe dragon depictions as [word].\"\n\n4. **Extract the Exact Context**\n   - WebSurfer: Extract the exact context in which the word is used, including the surrounding sentences. For example, \"As early as the sixties, scholars of children's literature have noted a trend to soften and satirize the dragon for children. Author X and Author Y both describe dragon depictions as [word], expressing distaste for the nature of these depictions.\"\n\n5. **Summarize the Findings**\n   - WebSurfer: Summarize the findings, including:\n     - The name of the journal: Fafnir\n     - The specific word quoted: [word]\n     - The identities of the two authors: [Author X] and [Author Y]\n     - The exact context in which the word is used.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, we should be able to accurately identify the word and the authors quoted in Emily Midkiff's article."}

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters.

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children’s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children’s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.\nKeywords\n dragon  \n uncanny  \n freud  \n children's literature Published in \nFafnirISSN\n2342-2009 (Online)\nPublisher\nFinnish Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy Research\nCountry of publisher\nFinland\nLCC subjects\nLanguage and Literature: Literature (General)\nWebsite\nhttps://journal.finfar.orgAbout the journal\nBack to top\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expresses distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n   - The journal is named \"Fafnir\" (verified from the search results).\n   - The article is titled \"Dragons are Tricksy\": The Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature.\n   - The article discusses the trend of softening and satirizing dragons in children's literature and argues that modern dragons still retain uncanny qualities from traditional lore.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific word that was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The identities of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n   - The exact context in which the word was used in the article.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house (Fafnir, as verified from the search results).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Word in Question**: The word in question might be something like \"cliché,\" \"overdone,\" or \"fantastical,\" as these terms are often used to express distaste for common tropes in literature or media.\n   - **Authors Quoted**: The two authors quoted could be well-known fantasy or literary critics, possibly from the field of children's literature or mythology. Given the context, they might be scholars like Maria Nikolajeva or John Clute, who are known for their work in children's literature and fantasy.\n   - **Context**: The word is likely used in the context of criticizing the trend of making dragons more friendly and less fearsome in modern children's literature. The article emphasizes the importance of retaining the uncanny and mythic qualities of dragons.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Word in Question**: The article's focus on the uncanny qualities of dragons and the criticism of modern, softened depictions suggests that the word in question is likely a term used to express disappointment or dissatisfaction with how dragons are portrayed in contemporary children's literature. Terms like \"cliché\" or \"overdone\" fit this context well.\n- **Authors Quoted**: Scholars like Maria Nikolajeva and John Clute are highly respected in the fields of children's literature and fantasy. Their opinions on the portrayal of dragons would be relevant and credible in this context.\n- **Context**: The article argues that modern dragons, while often softened, still retain uncanny qualities. The word in question is likely used to highlight the loss of these qualities in some modern depictions, emphasizing the need to preserve the mythic and archetypal power of dragons.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Open the Full Text of the Article**\n   - WebSurfer: Click the \"Read Online\" link to open the full text of Emily Midkiff's article in the June 2014 issue of Fafnir.\n\n2. **Scroll to the Relevant Section**\n   - WebSurfer: Scroll down the page to the section where the article discusses the criticism of dragon depictions.

This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.\nKeywords: Dragon, uncanny, Freud, children’s literature\nBiography: Emily Midkiff (MA, English and Children’s Literature) is teaching and working on her PhD at the University of Minnesota.\nJ.R.R. Tolkien once declared that “the dragon in legend is a potent creation of men’s imagination, richer in significance than his barrow is in gold” (“The Monsters” 16). Dragons in mythology have come to be recognized for their value as representations of ancient cultures or as worldwide archetypes. Anthropologists have found and studied dragons in nearly all surviving mythologies; medievalists have examined them in manuscripts and bestiaries. In modern literature, dragons have flourished in their newer realm of fantasy and children’s literature as one of its most pervasive mythic animals.\nYet within children’s literature, scholars have noted a trend beginning even before the dragon’s mass popularity in fantasy to soften and satirize the dragon for children. While this type of friendly dragon has become a well known resident of children’s books, this article argues that children’s literature dragons have been not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children’s literature dragons.\nFluffy Dragons\nIn comparison to ancient dragon lore, modern dragons for children inspire less terror and more laughter, beginning most noticeably with Kenneth Grahame’s “The Reluctant Dragon” in 1898. Ruth Stein in 1968 and Margaret Blount in 1974 both comment with distaste on the increasingly cuddly, “fluffy” nature of dragons in children’s literature. In a short article for \nElementary Education, Stein expresses hope that Tolkien’s Smaug would improve the literary dragon’s evolution and encourage properly scary dragons. While this has since proved true in part, the bemoaned fluffy dragons remain prevalent alongside Tolkien’s menacing breed. Nonetheless Blount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they could be less than terrifying and still remain “real dragons” (129). She points out several stories that fail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally behave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in order to inspire conflict. Jon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a “real” dragon is and even praises the proliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame’s dragon, as parodies of the outdated cultural codes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223). Hope Shastri’s 1992 dissertation on the picture book dragon gives concrete results to support the observations of scholars like Stein, Blount, and Stott. Shastri performed a content analysis of 151 picture books produced between 1950 and 1992 in order to ascertain whether or not dragons have preserved their range of mythic capabilities in that form of children’s literature. She divides picture book dragons into three categories: Household (the type that Blount accused of failure), Wildwood (untamed, living in the wild and closer to Tolkien’s sort), and Imaginary (clearly pretend or a dream on the part of a child) and identifies thirty traditional dragon traits such as breathing fire, consuming humans, guarding treasure, talking, flying, and being vanquished. After applying these categories and traits to all 151 books, Shastri concludes that picture book dragons have effectively lost the majority of their original mythic qualities, save fire-breathing, and have largely become tame and meek—especially the Household dragons, out of which she finds 86% to be denatured as opposed to 34% of Wildwood and 42% of Imaginary dragons (77). Tina L. Hanlon generally agrees with Shastri’s findings in her own examination of 100 picture books in 2003, but she also notes with some hope the resurgence of strong dragons in retold fairy tales. In total, the work of these scholars over the past two decades indicates that dragons in children’s books are increasingly humorous and less and less fearsome, just as Stein feared when she wrote over forty years ago.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

While this has since proved true in part, the bemoaned fluffy dragons remain prevalent alongside Tolkien’s menacing breed. Nonetheless Blount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they could be less than terrifying and still remain “real dragons” (129). She points out several stories that fail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally behave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in order to inspire conflict. Jon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a “real” dragon is and even praises the proliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame’s dragon, as parodies of the outdated cultural codes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223).

In total, the work of these scholars over the past two decades indicates that dragons in children’s books are increasingly humorous and less and less fearsome, just as Stein feared when she wrote over forty years ago.\nDragons and the Uncanny\nThere may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than these observations and studies indicate, due to one significant aspect of Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The traits listed by Shastri focus on characteristics of the dragons themselves but do not include the emotional environment created by the dragon within the literature or with the audience. Stott acknowledges the fear inspired by traditional dragons due to their size and fierce temper, but his analysis addresses only the physical threat of the dragons and implies that this fear is entirely lost when parodied (224). Blount comes close to recognizing this deeper psychological effect of dragons when she writes that a quality children’s literature dragon should still inspire awe. Awe and fear, yes, but the original dragons of Germanic lore from which children’s literature dragons descended were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories.\nThis uncanny quality of these ancestral dragons derives from their unnatural similarity to the heroes who defeat them; the dragons are doubles for humanity. Joyce Tally Lionarons and Jonathan Evans, scholars of medieval dragon-lore, assert that dragons such as the famous Fáfnir were terrifying and effective characters in epics because they vied with people for the right to be “human.” According to the classic definition by Freud, the uncanny double occurs when “one [person] possesses knowledge, feelings and experience in common with the other” and is also sometimes “marked by the fact that the subject identifies himself with someone else, so that he is in doubt as to which his self is, or substitutes the extraneous self for his own” (234).\n1 Freudian psychoanalysis has been applied to dragons in fairy tales by such scholars as Bruno Bettelheim, but he posits dragons as the dangerous, untamed id or the projection of oedipal issues by the child hero (76). Bettelheim’s analysis also locates dragons as an internal hero conflict, which in many ways complements to my argument here, but I focus on Freud’s concept of the uncanny rather than his superego-ego-id construct to explain the way that modern dragons can still unsettle readers even when the plot does not follow the traditional human hero questing to slay a physically fearsome dragon. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not life or ego-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire the uncanny doubling with humans: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech.\nThe remainder of this article will further explain how the dragon’s potent powers of vision and language operate as uncanny traits, how vision and language are recognized by scholars of Germanic dragon-lore, and how these traits were translated into children’s literature through such landmark texts as Grahame’s\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Tolkien’s Smaug in \nThe Hobbit (1937). Finally, I will examine some examples of the uncanny vision and language of the dragons of modern children’s literature through the middle-grade reader \nHow to Train Your Dragon Vol. 1 and the picture book \nHush, Little Dragon. These books serve as purposeful case studies intended to represent recent English-language literature for the youngest to middle-grade readers. Each book was selected out of a pool of potential recent dragon books because they represent clear, but not extraordinary or unusual, examples of tamed and human-like dragons, respectively. I mean to ultimately use these texts to demonstrate that while many commonplace modern dragons have evolved away from their ancestors to good or bad effect, the visual potency and intimacy with language inherited from older dragons remain a potent, if largely invisible, means of creating uncanny dragons in children’s literature. Stein and Blount protest the appearance of increasingly human dragons, but this very doubling has the potential to rescue the awe of dragons as long as they are just different and frightening enough to achieve the uncanny.\nThe Uncanny Dragon, Then and Now\nThe dragon’s eyes hold much of its power, as well as its ability to inspire uncanny fear. In Freud’s concept of the uncanny, the eyes are a frequent site of fear in two ways: as a displaced castration complex if the eyes are threatened, and as the evil-eye threatening oneself (231, 240). Colloquially considered windows to the soul, the eyes are also a significant cultural location for human identity. Likewise, the dragon’s powerful eyes are one of its identifying features and greatest assets in its efforts to seize human identity. When discussing the Indo-European name for the dragon, Jonathan Evans says that the Greek root “*drk-” originally means “to see, to watch” and “*drk-on” would mean something like “seeing one” (“As Rare” 23). Evans asserts that accordingly many Indo-European dragons are watchers and guarders responsible for keeping an eye on a treasure of some sort, and many have piercing or unnatural stares to discomfit potential attackers (23). The Greek dragon’s name and identity is based on its power of sight. The “unnatural” stare that Evans mentions also creates an eerie sense of the intelligence behind the dragon’s guardianship, a power and vision comparable if not superior to humanity’s. The human hero is responsible for guarding the people, the dragon for guarding the treasure. Until one defeats the other, they are equally identified as powerful over-seers threatening one another’s guardianship. Traditionally, when a hero faces and defeats a dragon, the slaying extinguishes the dragon’s superior vision. In doing so, the hero establishes himself as the greater power and superior identity as watcher-guardian. This challenge over the hero’s watcher-identity invokes the Freudian evil-eye or blindness as castration, making the dragon’s threat to one’s identity as watcher-guardian uncanny.\nAlongside the eyes, the dragon’s uncanny powers manifest in its associations with speech. As far as we know, dragons are primarily imaginary creatures that emerged from within the oral and written realms of storytelling.\n2 In Western literature, they leapt into being as an invention of language and shortly after acquired, within stories, the ability to out-speak humans.\n3 In creating language-capable monsters proficient with the tools of linguistic creation, poets and bards fashioned in dragons a double for themselves: the dragon as wielder of language and the raw potential for language—including the risk that language could escape human control and become dangerous. In this way dragons stole the human invention that created them and ventured uncomfortably close to humanity through the ability to speak with equal or superior eloquence. While other animals speak in legend and fairy tale, most of these creatures existed before language named them, and their words are simple and communicative. Dragons in contrast could not exist without language, and have a high language skill demonstrated through fondness for riddling talk and a tendency to use it aggressively.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

While other animals speak in legend and fairy tale, most of these creatures existed before language named them, and their words are simple and communicative. Dragons in contrast could not exist without language, and have a high language skill demonstrated through fondness for riddling talk and a tendency to use it aggressively.\n4 Furthermore, traditional dragons are notoriously evil where regular animals are not. Deirdre Dwen Pitts writes that folklore animals “date from the time when the world was not yet man-oriented and man and animal struggled together against uncontrollable natural forces” (169). These animals are on the humans’ side: “Animals are rarely the antagonists in these tales; enemies are usually undefined monsters, ogres, witches, giants, devils, demons, with only an occasional wolf” (169). Oddly missing from this list are dragons, which are also frequent enemies and shadows of humanity. The dragon is, like the uncanny, that which “ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light” (Freud 225). Many of the most terrifying and memorable dragons rely on their use of language to inspire fear and awe due to being distinctly unwelcome doubles for humanity.\nAlthough the dragon may imitate humanity through its roles as watcher and speaker, its physical properties keep it unfamiliar enough to be uncanny. The dragon’s appearance comes down as inconsistent through European lore, but the medieval dragon is never nice-looking or aesthetically pleasing. This traditional dragon combines frightening and uncomfortable aspects taken from beasts who threaten humanity: snakes, big cats, and birds of prey.\n5 Therefore when this undesirable anti-human claims human identity, the thought becomes inherently unsettling to humans. Having this conglomeration of everything that one finds frightening and uncomfortable nearly become the same as oneself produces the uncanny doubling effect. Furthermore, Freud suggests that the familiar unfamiliar of the uncanny is the result of repressed experiences (241); accordingly many of these old stories imply that the dragon embodies the repressed dark side of the hero.\nIn the medieval Germanic dragon myths, the dragon watching over a hoard becomes an uncanny double for the hero watching over the people. In \nBeowulf, the poet uses identical words to describe the roles of Beowulf and the dragon. At different times he calls them both \naglæcan, meaning “warrior,” and only context distinguishes the hero from the dragon (Lionarons 30). The same phrase \nhordweard or “hoard-guardian” refers to both. The dragon’s lair is called a \ndryhtsele, the term used for a human king’s hall (30). These examples of parallel naming reveal the doubled natures of hero and dragon as well as their conflicting positions. They perform the same job, but only one can succeed. In the inevitable conflict, the two guardians are so similar they nearly cancel one another out. Both kill one another; only narrowly does Beowulf come out on top as the successful overseer. By killing the dragon, he proves an effective guardian of his people from the dragon menace, but he also performs the final viewing and therefore possession of the dragon’s treasure. The two concepts are connected, as the poet shows through Beowulf’s insistence upon seeing the treasure before dying. When Wiglaf brings it to him, Beowulf gazes on it and says, “I give thanks / that I behold this treasure here in front of me, / that I have been allowed to leave my people / so well endowed on the day I die” (ln 2795-2798). He believes the treasure he has won could support his people, and therefore what the dragon has been watching over has been converted to a part of Beowulf’s ward. His ability to look on the treasure assures him that he has won the battle of eyes.\nThe language of the Germanic dragons also doubled them with humans, and in two ways: the way that the dragons were spoken about and the way that they spoke. Aside from how similar words are used in \nBeowulf to align the hero and the dragon, the Indo-European dragon-slaying myth has its own special verb formula reserved for the epic killing of dragons. In her book on medieval dragons, Lionarons points out that instead of an active verb such as “to slay,” the dragon-slaying verb is self-reflexive and roughly translates “to become slayer to” (6). The action of slaying defines the hero/slayer against the dragon/slain. The way this particular verb functions, Lionarons notes, “suggests a covert similarity between subject and object, hero and dragon” (6). The cosmic dragon-slaying myth and later the legendary hero tale, she explains, worked through one voice silencing the other—the battle is over language since the winner gets to declare himself to be the god/hero and the loser to be the dragon (8). The need for such a battle reveals the uncomfortable similarity between heroes and dragons in the tales of dragon-slayers such as Sigurd, Þiđrek, Beowulf, and Thor. Each hero ultimately defines himself as the hero; it is the narrow margin of success and uncertain hero status that creates the uncanniness.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Each hero ultimately defines himself as the hero; it is the narrow margin of success and uncertain hero status that creates the uncanniness.\nThe dragons also use language to fight for the speaking, dominant role, as can be seen in the verbal battle that occurs at the death of the dragon Fáfnir. In the \nVolsunga Saga version, the hero Sigurd kills Fáfnir through a trick; the actual violence is brief. As the dragon slowly dies, it speaks (\nVolsunga 78). Lionarons claims that the conversation is riskier than the attack, for despite Fáfnir’s mortal wounds, he threatens to take the winner’s right as silencer through engaging the Germanic genres of the \nsenna, death song, and wisdom poetry (69). The \nsenna is a stylized battle of words accomplished through ritual insults and challenges meant to establish one’s social place. When Fáfnir engages Sigurd in this battle, as Armann Jakobsson puts it, “readers will be prone to an eerie feeling that the dragon is somehow outwitting Sigurđr” (31). This eerie feeling results from a distinctly non-human entity fighting for the human social rank of hero, and doing well. The dragon’s skill at word-play indicates that the non-human may actually be better at the human’s game of language. Fáfnir nearly wins through wisdom poetry that touches on the cosmological and silences the hero. Sigurd, in his efforts to outsmart Fáfnir and find an unanswerable question, asks about the end of the world: “How namest thou the holm whereon Surt and the Æsir mix and mingle in the water of the sword?” (\nVolsung 80) Surt, the fire giant, is fated to destroy the world at Ragnarok in a battle against the Æsir. The beginning and the end of the world in Norse myth revolve around the conquering and resurgence of chaos, embodied in part by the Midgard Serpent, Jormungandr, the immense dragon that was defeated at the world’s creation by Thor and will in turn defeat Thor at Ragnarok. In asking about the cosmic end, Sigurd questions the farthest reaches of wisdom and speech, being and non-being, and the cosmic battle of dragon and hero, which he is re-enacting in miniature. Fáfnir replies, in many translations: “Unshapen is that holm hight,” or the island is not named (80). In the original Icelandic, he calls the island “Oskopnir” (Hunt). Translations of the “The Lay of Fafnir” from the Elder Edda often phrase the reply: “Oskopnir it is called” (174). August Hunt claims that translating the word as a mere lack of name misrepresents it. The –nir is a basic Icelandic suffix, but combined with Oskop-, meaning “umade,” it could instead indicate the “island of unmaking” (Hunt). Therefore the island could be not yet made, not yet named, or the place of the final unmaking. Possibly all three at once, straining the human mind to embrace the dragon’s polysemic phrasing. Fáfnir’s bewildering understanding and deft verbal expression of cosmic knowledge hushes Sigurd. The dragon’s next words, Lionarons claims, change from wisdom poetry to a death song—a genre reserved for dying heroes. Sigurd interrupts and steers them back into the \nsenna, narrowly getting the last word and walking away with his victory and identity as the hero intact. This threatening similarity between Sigurd and Fáfnir exemplifies the speaking dragon’s uncanny ability to become the supreme double and threat to humanity.\nFrom Victorian Satire to Modern Fantasy\nFollowing the medieval surge of Christianity in Europe, the Germanic legends of Western dragons became inextricably tied to the Devil-dragon of Revelation and far too allegorical for use in common secular stories, according to Ruth Berman. Not until the late 1800’s, with the discoveries of dinosaur remains, were dragons tenable outside of allegory (Berman 220). At that point, Berman claims, Kenneth Grahame’s lighthearted, secular story “The Reluctant Dragon” in 1898 helped resurrect the dragon from its allegorical existence. Grahame’s was a carefree and satirical dragon—far removed from the heavy religious matter of Revelation. Grahame’s version retained only subtle traces of the dragon’s menacing eyes and language and made his dragon prefer poetry or being a spectacle over fighting. Again, a human hero of the tale, the shepherd’s boy, doubles the dragon in that he also writes poetry, “heaps of it” in fact, and would very much like to watch a spectacle (335). The dragon and the boy differ though, when it comes to violence. The dragon prefers grammar and chastises the boy: “Don’t be\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

This term is explicitly used in the article to describe the nature of these depictions.\n- **Authors Quoted**: Ruth Stein and Margaret Blount are mentioned in the article for their comments on the nature of dragon depictions, making them the likely authors quoted.\n- **Context**: The article argues that modern dragons, while often softened, still retain uncanny qualities. The word \"fluffy\" is used to highlight the loss of these qualities in some modern depictions, emphasizing the need to preserve the mythic and archetypal power of dragons.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Open the Full Text of the Article**\n   - WebSurfer: Click the \"Read Online\" link to open the full text of Emily Midkiff's article in the June 2014 issue of Fafnir.\n\n2. **Scroll to the Relevant Section**\n   - WebSurfer: Scroll down the page to the section where the article discusses the criticism of dragon depictions.

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children’s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children’s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.\nPublished in \nFafnirISSN\n2342-2009 (Online)\nPublisher\nFinnish Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy Research\nCountry of publisher\nFinland\nLCC subjects\nLanguage and Literature: Literature (General)\nWebsite\nhttps://journal.finfar.orgAbout the journal\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1\",\n        \"msapplication-TileColor\": \"#da532c\",\n        \"msapplication-config\": \"/assets/img/favicon/browserconfig.xml\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"description\": \"As early as the sixties, scholars of children's literature have noted a trend to soften and satirize the dragon for children.
