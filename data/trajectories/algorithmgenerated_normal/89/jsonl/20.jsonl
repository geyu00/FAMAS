{"agent": "Validation_Expert", "content": "Before making any conclusions, we need to validate the provided results. Specifically, we will:\n\n1.

Confirm the number of at bats Player_D had in that same season.\n\nLetâ€™s start by verifying the player with the most walks in the 1977 regular season for the Yankees. Then, we will confirm the number of at bats for that player. Let's collect historical data and cross-reference for validation. \n\nI suggest using a trustworthy online database, such as Baseball Reference, to retrieve and verify this information.\n\nFirst, I'll check the online database to confirm the player with the most walks.
