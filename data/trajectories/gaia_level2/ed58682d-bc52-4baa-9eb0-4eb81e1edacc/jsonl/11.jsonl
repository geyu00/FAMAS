Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The artist in question is the \"King of Pop,\" which refers to Michael Jackson.\n   - We are looking for the last word before the second chorus.\n   - The song in question is the fifth single from Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The title of Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.\n   - The track listing of the sixth studio album to identify the fifth single.\n   - The lyrics of the identified single, specifically focusing on the section just before the second chorus.\n   - These facts can be found in music databases, official discographies, and lyric websites such as Genius, AllMusic, and Michael Jackson's official website.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identifying the exact placement of the second chorus in the song.\n   - Determining the last word before the second chorus based on the lyrics.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Michael Jackson's sixth studio album is likely \"Bad,\" released in 1987.\n   - The fifth single from \"Bad\" is likely \"Man in the Mirror.\"\n   - The structure of \"Man in the Mirror\" is well-known, and the second chorus can be reasonably predicted based on the typical structure of pop songs from that era.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Sixth Studio Album and Fifth Single:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Search for Michael Jackson's discography to confirm the sixth studio album and its fifth single.\n  \n- **Find the Lyrics:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Once the fifth single is confirmed, search for the lyrics of the song, focusing on the section before the second chorus.\n  \n- **Locate the Last Word Before the Second Chorus:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Identify the exact placement of the second chorus and note the last word before it.\n  \n- **Verify and Report:**\n  - **Assistant:** Confirm the findings and provide the last word before the second chorus."}
