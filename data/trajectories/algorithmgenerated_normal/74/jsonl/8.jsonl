{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "It seems there was an error while trying to execute the quote search code due to an SSL issue with the server. Since we can't rely on external services at the moment, I will approach this problem differently by proposing a more manual investigation to find the quote associated with \"quidnunc\".\n\nWe can look for quotes from notable authors or works that include \"quidnunc\" in literary resources or databases. However, since we need to verify any potential quote properly, we must narrow down sources that can be trustworthy.\n\nLet’s propose that we first search known sources for quotations or literature that may have included \"quidnunc.\" I will create a simple list of known authors who might have used the word in their writing, and we can verify from there. \n\nI will draft a list of potential authors or references who are likely to have used \"quidnunc\" in a meaningful quote. \n\nHere’s a quick list to start with:\n\n1. **Samuel Johnson** - Known for his dictionary and use of various interesting terms.\n2. **Charles Dickens** - His character-driven stories may have used such terms.\n3. **Oscar Wilde** - Famous for his witty comments and could potentially have used \"quidnunc.\"\n\nLet me know if you would like me to proceed with further specific verifications or a more refined search based on specific literary references!"}
