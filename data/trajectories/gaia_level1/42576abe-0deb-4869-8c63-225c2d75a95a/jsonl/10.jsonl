Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sentence structure in Tizin is Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n   - \"Pa\" is the nominative form for oneself.\n   - \"Mato\" is the accusative form for oneself.\n   - \"Sing\" is the genitive form for oneself.\n   - The root verb \"Maktay\" indicates an intense like for something.\n   - \"Maktay\" is used in its root form in the present tense.\n   - \"Tay\" is the preterit past form of \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Aktay\" is the imperfect past form of \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Maktay\" translates better as \"is pleasing to\".\n   - \"Apple\" is the nominative form for apples.\n   - \"Zapple\" is the accusative form for apples.\n   - \"Izapple\" is the genitive form for apples.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - No specific facts need to be looked up as all necessary information is provided in the request.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The correct translation of \"I like apples\" into Tizin, considering the sentence structure and the specific forms of the words provided.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The sentence \"I like apples\" in Tizin will likely use the present tense form of \"Maktay\" (i.e., \"Maktay\").\n   - The subject \"I\" will be in the nominative form (\"Pa\").\n   - The object \"apples\" will be in the accusative form (\"Zapple\").\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Confirm the sentence structure and verb conjugation rules for Tizin from the given information.\n- Identify the correct forms of the words to be used in the sentence.\n- Construct the sentence \"I like apples\" in Tizin using the identified forms and structure.\n- Verify the constructed sentence for accuracy based on the provided rules.\n- Provide the final translation to the user."}

{"agent": "Assistant", "content": "Based on the provided grammatical rules and sentence structure for Tizin, let's construct the sentence \"I like apples\" step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the verb form**: Since we are expressing a present tense statement, we will use the root form of the verb \"Maktay\".\n2. **Identify the direct object**: The direct object \"apples\" should be in the accusative form, which is \"Zapple\".\n3. **Identify the subject**: The subject \"I\" should be in the nominative form, which is \"Pa\".\n\nGiven the sentence structure in Tizin (Verb + Direct Object + Subject), the sentence \"I like apples\" would be constructed as follows:\n\n```python\n# Construct the sentence in Tizin\nverb = \"Maktay\"\ndirect_object = \"Zapple\"\nsubject = \"Pa\"\n\n# Form the sentence\nsentence = f\"{verb} {direct_object} {subject}\"\nprint(sentence)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final translation."}
