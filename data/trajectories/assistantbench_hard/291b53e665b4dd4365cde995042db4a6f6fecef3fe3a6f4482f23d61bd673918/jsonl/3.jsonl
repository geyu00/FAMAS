{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the link to the GFF3 file for beluga whales that was the most recent one on 20/10/2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The date of interest is 20/10/2020.\n   - The file type of interest is a GFF3 file.\n   - The species of interest is the beluga whale.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The specific source or database where such GFF3 files are stored and updated (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl, or a specialized marine mammal genomics database).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None. The information required is directly available if the correct source is identified.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file for beluga whales is likely to be hosted on a major genomics database such as NCBI or Ensembl, which are known for maintaining genomic data for various species.\n   - The file might be part of a larger dataset or project related to marine mammal genomics.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Source**: WebSurfer will search for the most authoritative source for GFF3 files of beluga whales, focusing on databases like NCBI, Ensembl, or other specialized marine mammal genomics resources.\n- **Locate the File**: Once the source is identified, WebSurfer will navigate to the specific section or page where GFF3 files for beluga whales are stored.\n- **Verify the Date**: WebSurfer will check the metadata or file details to confirm the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n- **Extract the Link**: WebSurfer will extract the direct link to the identified GFF3 file.\n- **Report the Findings**: WebSurfer will provide the link to the GFF3 file along with any relevant details (e.g., file name, size, and any additional metadata)."}

Ensembl provides an automatic gene annotation for Delphinapterus leucas. For some species ( human, mouse, zebrafish, pig and rat), the annotation provided through Ensembl also includes manual annotation from HAVANA. In the case of human and mouse, the GTF files found here are equivalent to the GENCODE gene set. GTF provides access to all annotated transcripts which make up an Ensembl gene set. Annotation is based on alignments of biological evidence (eg. proteins, cDNAs, RNA-seq) to a genome assembly. The annotation dumped here is transcribed and translated from the genome assembly and is not the original input sequence data that we used for alignment. Therefore, the sequences provided by Ensembl may differ from the original input sequence data where the genome assembly is different to the aligned sequence. Additionally, we provide a GTF file containing the predicted gene set as generated by Genscan and other abinitio prediction tools. This file is identified by the abinitio extension. ----------- FILE NAMES ------------ The files are consistently named following this pattern: <species>.<assembly>.<version>.gtf.gz <species>: The systematic name of the species. <assembly>: The assembly build name. <version>: The version of Ensembl from which the data was exported. gtf : All files in these directories are in GTF format gz : All files are compacted with GNU Zip for storage efficiency. e.g. Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.81.gtf.gz For the predicted gene set, an additional abinitio flag is added to the name file. <species>.<assembly>.<version>.abinitio.gtf.gz e.g. Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.81.abinitio.gtf.gz -------------------------------- Definition and supported options -------------------------------- The GTF (General Transfer Format) is an extension of GFF version 2 and used to represent transcription models. GFF (General Feature Format) consists of one line per feature, each containing 9 columns of data. Fields Fields are tab-separated. Also, all but the final field in each feature line must contain a value; \"empty\" columns are denoted with a '.' seqname - name of the chromosome or scaffold; chromosome names without a 'chr' source - name of the program that generated this feature, or the data source (database or project name) feature - feature type name. Current allowed features are {gene, transcript, exon, CDS, Selenocysteine, start_codon, stop_codon and UTR} start - start position of the feature, with sequence numbering starting at 1. end - end position of the feature, with sequence numbering starting at 1. score - a floating point value indiciating the score of a feature strand - defined as + (forward) or - (reverse). frame - one of '0', '1' or '2'. Frame indicates the number of base pairs before you encounter a full codon. '0' indicates the feature begins with a whole codon. '1' indicates there is an extra base (the 3rd base of the prior codon) at the start of this feature. '2' indicates there are two extra bases (2nd and 3rd base of the prior exon) before the first codon. All values are given with relation to the 5' end. attribute - a semicolon-separated list of tag-value pairs (separated by a space), providing additional information about each feature. A key can be repeated multiple times. Attributes The following attributes are available. All attributes are semi-colon separated pairs of keys and values. - gene_id: The stable identifier for the gene - gene_version: The stable identifier version for the gene - gene_name: The official symbol of this gene - gene_source: The annotation source for this gene - gene_biotype: The biotype of this gene - transcript_id: The stable identifier for this transcript - transcript_version: The stable identifier version for this transcript - transcript_name: The symbold for this transcript derived from the gene name - transcript_source: The annotation source for this transcript - transcript_biotype: The biotype for this transcript - exon_id: The stable identifier for this exon - exon_version: The stable identifier version for this exon - exon_number: Position of this exon in the transcript - ccds_id: CCDS identifier linked to this transcript - protein_id: Stable identifier for this transcript's protein - protein_version: Stable identifier version for this transcript's protein - tag: A collection of additional key value tags - transcript_support_level: Ranking to assess how well a transcript is supported (from 1 to 5) Tags Tags are additional flags used to indicate attibutes of the transcript. - CCDS: Flags this transcript as one linked to a CCDS record - seleno: Flags this transcript has a Selenocysteine edit. Look for the Selenocysteine feature for the position of this on the genome - cds_end_NF: the coding region end could not be confirmed - cds_start_NF: the coding region start could not be confirmed - mRNA_end_NF: the mRNA end could not be confirmed - mRNA_start_NF: the mRNA start could not be confirmed. - gencode_basic: the transcript is part of the gencode basic geneset - gencode_primary: the transcript is part of the gencode primary geneset Comments Lines may be commented out by the addition of a single # character at the start. These lines should be ignored by your parser. Pragmas/Metadata GTF files can contain meta-data. In the case of experimental meta-data these are noted by a #!. Those which are stable are noted by a ##. Meta data is a single key, a space and then the value.

The information required is directly available if the correct source and release version are identified.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file for beluga whales is likely to be hosted on Ensembl, which is a well-known and reputable genomics database.\n   - The GFF3 file for beluga whales might be part of a specific release version of Ensembl, and the release notes or metadata might provide the necessary date information.\n   - Given that the current Ensembl release (114) is from May 2025, the GFF3 file for beluga whales from 20/10/2020 is likely to be in an earlier release. We need to find the appropriate historical release that corresponds to the date of interest.\n   - The GFF3 file for beluga whales might be stored in the `current_gff3` directory on the Ensembl FTP server, but we need to verify the release date to ensure it matches 20/10/2020.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Ensembl as a Reliable Source**: Ensembl is a well-established and widely used genomics database, making it a reliable source for finding the GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n- **Historical Releases**: Since the current release (114) is from May 2025, the GFF3 file from 20/10/2020 would be in an earlier release. We need to identify the correct historical release to find the file.\n- **FTP Directory Structure**: The `current_gff3` directory on the Ensembl FTP server contains the latest GFF3 files, but we need to check the historical releases to find the file from 20/10/2020.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Navigate to the historical releases section on the Ensembl FTP server.\n2. Identify the release that corresponds to the date of interest (20/10/2020).\n3. Locate the GFF3 file for beluga whales in that release and verify the release date.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: The previous attempts involved navigating to incorrect directories or clicking on irrelevant links, leading to a failure in locating the specific GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n- **Lack of Verification**: There was no systematic verification of the release dates to ensure that the file was from the correct date (20/10/2020).\n- **Inefficient Search Strategy**: The search strategy did not account for historical releases, which are necessary to find files from a specific past date.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Navigate to Historical Releases**:\n   - WebSurfer should navigate to the Ensembl FTP server's historical releases section.\n   - Specifically, go to the `release-100` directory, as it is likely to be around the time of interest (20/10/2020).\n\n2. **Locate the Beluga Whale GFF3 File**:\n   - Within the `release-100` directory, navigate to the `gff3` subdirectory.\n   - Locate the `delphinapterus_leucas` directory and find the GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n\n3. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   - Check the metadata or file details to confirm the release date of the GFF3 file.\n   - Ensure the file is from or before 20/10/2020.\n\n4. **Extract the Link**:\n   - Once the correct GFF3 file is identified, extract the direct link to the file.\n\n5. **Report the Findings**:\n   - Provide the link to the GFF3 file along with any relevant details (e.g., file name, size, and any additional metadata).\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1: Navigate to Historical Releases**\n  - WebSurfer should go to the Ensembl FTP server: `https://ftp.ensembl.org/`.\n  - Navigate to the `pub` directory.\n  - Navigate to the `release-100` directory.\n\n- **Step 2: Locate the Beluga Whale GFF3 File**\n  - Within the `release-100` directory, navigate to the `gff3` subdirectory.\n  - Locate the `delphinapterus_leucas` directory.\n  - Find the GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify the Release Date**\n  - Check the file details or metadata to confirm the release date.\n  - Ensure the file is from or before 20/10/2020.\n\n- **Step 4: Extract the Link**\n  - Once the correct GFF3 file is identified, extract the direct link to the file.\n\n- **Step 5: Report the Findings**\n  - Provide the link to the GFF3 file along with any relevant details.\n\n### Example Commands\n- **Navigate to Historical Releases**\n  ```sh\n  https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/\n  ```\n\n- **Locate the Beluga Whale GFF3 File**\n  ```sh\n  https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/gff3/delphinapterus_leucas/\n  ```\n\n- **Verify the Release Date**\n  - Check the file details or metadata.\n\n- **Extract the Link**\n  - Once the correct file is identified, extract the link.\n\n- **Report the Findings**\n  - Provide the link and details.\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to locate and verify the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020."}
