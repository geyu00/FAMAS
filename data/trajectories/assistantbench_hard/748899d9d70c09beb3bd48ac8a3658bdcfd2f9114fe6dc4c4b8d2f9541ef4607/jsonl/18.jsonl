{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nHow much does it cost to send an envelope with 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with DHL, USPS, or Fedex? (Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sender is located in Rio de Janeiro.\n   - The recipient is located in New York City (NYC).\n   - The delivery time frame is 1 week.\n   - The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n   - Specific 1-week delivery options and their associated costs for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n   - The official websites of DHL, USPS, and FedEx for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping option, including any additional fees or taxes.\n   - Whether the 1-week delivery time frame is achievable with the standard services offered by each carrier, or if expedited services are required.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - DHL, USPS, and FedEx all offer international shipping services, but the exact costs and options may vary.\n   - The cost of shipping an envelope internationally is likely to be higher than domestic shipping due to longer distances and customs handling.\n   - Additional fees such as customs duties, VAT, or handling charges may apply, especially for international shipments.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx**:\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the official websites of DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n  - Search for the international shipping rate calculators on each website.\n  - Input the necessary details (sender: Rio de Janeiro, recipient: New York City, item type: envelope, delivery time: 1 week) into the rate calculators.\n  \n- **Gather the results**:\n  - Extract the cost estimates for each shipping option from the rate calculators.\n  - Note any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping.\n\n- **Format the results**:\n  - Compile the gathered information into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n\n- **Verify the accuracy**:\n  - Double-check the extracted information to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date.\n\n- **Present the final results**:\n  - Provide the formatted list of JSON objects with the shipping costs."}

(Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser.

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sender is located in Rio de Janeiro.\n   - The recipient is located in New York City (NYC).\n   - The delivery time frame is 1 week.\n   - The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - The official website of DHL encountered a technical issue when accessed, preventing the retrieval of shipping rates.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n   - Specific 1-week delivery options and their associated costs for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n   - The official websites of USPS and FedEx for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping option, including any additional fees or taxes.\n   - Whether the 1-week delivery time frame is achievable with the standard services offered by each carrier, or if expedited services are required.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - DHL, USPS, and FedEx all offer international shipping services, but the exact costs and options may vary.\n   - The cost of shipping an envelope internationally is likely to be higher than domestic shipping due to longer distances and customs handling.\n   - Additional fees such as customs duties, VAT, or handling charges may apply, especially for international shipments.\n   - Given the technical issues with the DHL website, it might be more efficient to use alternative methods to obtain DHL shipping rates, such as contacting their customer service or using a third-party shipping calculator.\n   - FedEx and USPS websites are likely to provide more reliable and accessible rate calculators for international shipping.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The technical issue with the DHL website suggests that direct access might not be the most reliable method for obtaining shipping rates. Alternative methods, such as contacting customer service or using third-party tools, could provide more accurate and timely information.\n- FedEx and USPS are known for having robust and user-friendly rate calculators, which are likely to be more accessible and provide the necessary information without technical issues.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Technical Issues with DHL Website**: The DHL website encountered a `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`, preventing access to the rate calculator.\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: The attempts to navigate through search results and directly to the DHL website were not successful due to the technical issues.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to USPS and FedEx Websites**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to directly navigate to the official USPS (https://www.usps.com) and FedEx (https://www.fedex.com) websites.\n   - Locate the international shipping rate calculators on these websites.\n\n2. **Input Required Details**:\n   - For both USPS and FedEx, input the following details into the rate calculators:\n     - Sender location: Rio de Janeiro\n     - Recipient location: New York City\n     - Item type: Envelope\n     - Desired delivery time: 1 week\n\n3. **Record Cost Estimates and Additional Fees**:\n   - Extract the cost estimates for each shipping option.\n   - Note any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping.\n\n4. **Contact DHL Customer Service**:\n   - If the DHL website remains inaccessible, use WebSurfer to find the contact information for DHL customer service.\n   - Contact DHL customer service via phone or email to inquire about the shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery time frame.\n\n5. **Compile and Format Results**:\n   - Compile the gathered information into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n   - Ensure the information is accurate and up-to-date.\n\n6. **Double-Check and Verify**:\n   - Review the extracted information to ensure it is accurate and complete.\n   - Provide the formatted list of JSON objects with the shipping costs.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to USPS and FedEx Websites**:\n   - WebSurfer, please navigate to the official USPS website (https://www.usps.com) and locate the international shipping rate calculator.\n   - WebSurfer, please navigate to the official FedEx website (https://www.fedex.com) and locate the international shipping rate calculator.\n\n2. **Input Required Details**:\n   - WebSurfer, input the following details into the USPS rate calculator:\n     - Sender location: Rio de Janeiro\n     - Recipient location: New York City\n     - Item type: Envelope\n     - Desired delivery time: 1 week\n   - WebSurfer, input the following details into the FedEx rate calculator:\n     - Sender location: Rio de Janeiro\n     - Recipient location: New York City\n     - Item type: Envelope\n     - Desired delivery time: 1 week\n\n3. **Record Cost Estimates and Additional Fees**:\n   - WebSurfer, extract the cost estimates for each shipping option from the USPS and FedEx rate calculators.\n   - Note any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping.\n\n4. **Contact DHL Customer Service**:\n   - WebSurfer, if the DHL website remains inaccessible, find the contact information for DHL customer service.\n   - WebSurfer, contact DHL customer service via phone or email to inquire about the shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery time frame.\n\n5. **Compile and Format Results**:\n   - Assistant, compile the gathered information into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n\n6. **Double-Check and Verify**:\n   - Assistant, review the extracted information to ensure it is accurate and complete.\n   - Provide the formatted list of JSON objects with the shipping costs."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nHow much does it cost to send an envelope with 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with DHL, USPS, or Fedex? (Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sender is located in Rio de Janeiro.\n   - The recipient is located in New York City (NYC).\n   - The delivery time frame is 1 week.\n   - The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - The official website of DHL encountered a technical issue when accessed, preventing the retrieval of shipping rates.\n   - The USPS price calculator requires specific details such as the weight of the envelope and the value of the item being mailed.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n   - Specific 1-week delivery options and their associated costs for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n   - The official websites of USPS and FedEx for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n   - The weight and value of the envelope to input into the USPS price calculator.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping option, including any additional fees or taxes.\n   - Whether the 1-week delivery time frame is achievable with the standard services offered by each carrier, or if expedited services are required.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - DHL, USPS, and FedEx all offer international shipping services, but the exact costs and options may vary.\n   - The cost of shipping an envelope internationally is likely to be higher than domestic shipping due to longer distances and customs handling.\n   - Additional fees such as customs duties, VAT, or handling charges may apply, especially for international shipments.\n   - Given the technical issues with the DHL website, it might be more efficient to use alternative methods to obtain DHL shipping rates, such as contacting their customer service or using a third-party shipping calculator.\n   - FedEx and USPS websites are likely to provide more reliable and accessible rate calculators for international shipping.\n   - The USPS price calculator may require more detailed information to provide accurate rates, such as the weight of the envelope and the value of the item being mailed.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The technical issue with the DHL website suggests that direct access might not be the most reliable method for obtaining shipping rates. Alternative methods, such as contacting customer service or using third-party tools, could provide more accurate and timely information.\n- FedEx and USPS are known for having robust and user-friendly rate calculators, which are likely to be more accessible and provide the necessary information without technical issues.\n- The USPS price calculator requires specific details to provide accurate rates, which means we need to gather more information about the envelope, such as its weight and value.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to USPS and FedEx Websites**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to directly navigate to the official USPS (https://www.usps.com) and FedEx (https://www.fedex.com) websites.\n   - Locate the international shipping rate calculators on these websites.\n\n2. **Input Required Details**:\n   - For both USPS and FedEx, input the following details into the rate calculators:\n     - Sender location: Rio de Janeiro\n     - Recipient location: New York City\n     - Item type: Envelope\n     - Desired delivery time: 1 week\n     - Weight of the envelope: (to be determined)\n     - Value of the item being mailed: (to be determined)\n\n3. **Record Cost Estimates and Additional Fees**:\n   - Extract the cost estimates for each shipping option.\n   - Note any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping.\n\n4. **Contact DHL Customer Service**:\n   - If the DHL website remains inaccessible, use WebSurfer to find the contact information for DHL customer service.\n   - Contact DHL customer service via phone or email to inquire about the shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery time frame.\n\n5. **Compile and Format Results**:\n   - Compile the gathered information into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n   - Ensure the information is accurate and up-to-date.\n\n6. **Double-Check and Verify**:\n   - Review the extracted information to ensure it is accurate and complete.\n   - Provide the formatted list of JSON objects with the shipping costs.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to USPS and FedEx Websites**:\n   - WebSurfer, please navigate to the official USPS website (https://www.usps.com) and locate the international shipping rate calculator.\n   - WebSurfer, please navigate to the official FedEx website (https://www.fedex.com) and locate the international shipping rate calculator.\n\n2. **Input Required Details**:\n   - WebSurfer, input the following details into the USPS rate calculator:\n     - Sender location: Rio de Janeiro\n     - Recipient location: New York City\n     - Item type: Envelope\n     - Desired delivery time: 1 week\n     - Weight of the envelope: (to be determined)\n     - Value of the item being mailed: (to be determined)\n   - WebSurfer, input the following details into the FedEx rate calculator:\n     - Sender location: Rio de Janeiro\n     - Recipient location: New York City\n     - Item type: Envelope\n     - Desired delivery time: 1 week\n     - Weight of the envelope: (to be determined)\n     - Value of the item being mailed: (to be determined)\n\n3. **Record Cost Estimates and Additional Fees**:\n   - WebSurfer, extract the cost estimates for each shipping option from the USPS and FedEx rate calculators.\n   - Note any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping.\n\n4. **Contact DHL Customer Service**:\n   - WebSurfer, if the DHL website remains inaccessible, find the contact information for DHL customer service.\n   - WebSurfer, contact DHL customer service via phone or email to inquire about the shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery time frame.\n\n5. **Compile and Format Results**:\n   - Assistant, compile the gathered information into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n\n6. **Double-Check and Verify**:\n   - Assistant, review the extracted information to ensure it is accurate and complete.\n   - Provide the formatted list of JSON objects with the shipping costs.\n\nLet's start by navigating to the USPS and FedEx websites and inputting the required details. Please proceed with the steps outlined above.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetition of Steps**: The previous attempts involved repeatedly navigating to the same pages and inputting the same information without addressing the underlying issues.\n- **Incomplete Information**: The USPS price calculator requires more detailed information, such as the weight of the envelope and the value of the item being mailed, which was not provided.\n- **Technical Issues with DHL**: The DHL website encountered a technical issue, which prevented us from accessing the rate calculator. This issue was not resolved in subsequent attempts.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Gather Required Information**:\n   - Determine the weight of the envelope and the value of the item being mailed.\n   - This information is necessary for the USPS price calculator to provide accurate rates.\n\n2. **Navigate to USPS and FedEx Websites**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the official USPS (https://www.usps.com) and FedEx (https://www.fedex.com) websites.\n   - Locate the international shipping rate calculators on these websites.\n\n3. **Input Required Details**:\n   - For both USPS and FedEx, input the following details into the rate calculators:\n     - Sender location: Rio de Janeiro\n     - Recipient location: New York City\n     - Item type: Envelope\n     - Desired delivery time: 1 week\n     - Weight of the envelope: (to be determined)\n     - Value of the item being mailed: (to be determined)\n\n4. **Extract Cost Estimates and Additional Fees**:\n   - Extract the cost estimates for each shipping option.\n   - Note any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping.\n\n5. **Contact DHL Customer Service**:\n   - If the DHL website remains inaccessible, use WebSurfer to find the contact information for DHL customer service.\n   - Contact DHL customer service via phone or email to inquire about the shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery time frame.\n\n6. **Compile and Format Results**:\n   - Compile the gathered information into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n   - Ensure the information is accurate and up-to-date.\n\n7. **Double-Check and Verify**:\n   - Review the extracted information to ensure it is accurate and complete.\n   - Provide the formatted list of JSON objects with the shipping costs.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Determine Required Information**:\n   - WebSurfer, please determine the average weight of a standard envelope and a typical value for a non-negotiable document being mailed.\n\n2. **Navigate to USPS Website**:\n   - WebSurfer, please navigate to the official USPS website (https://www.usps.com) and locate the international shipping rate calculator.\n   - Input the following details:\n     - Sender location: Rio de Janeiro\n     - Recipient location: New York City\n     - Item type: Envelope\n     - Desired delivery time: 1 week\n     - Weight of the envelope: (use the determined weight)\n     - Value of the item being mailed: (use the determined value)\n\n3. **Extract USPS Cost Estimate**:\n   - WebSurfer, extract the cost estimate and any additional fees or taxes that may apply.\n\n4. **Navigate to FedEx Website**:\n   - WebSurfer, please navigate to the official FedEx website (https://www.fedex.com) and locate the international shipping rate calculator.\n   - Input the same details as for USPS.\n\n5. **Extract FedEx Cost Estimate**:\n   - WebSurfer, extract the cost estimate and any additional fees or taxes that may apply.\n\n6. **Contact DHL Customer Service**:\n   - WebSurfer, if the DHL website remains inaccessible, find the contact information for DHL customer service.\n   - Contact DHL customer service via phone or email to inquire about the shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery time frame.\n\n7. **Compile and Format Results**:\n   - Assistant, compile the gathered information into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n\n8. **Double-Check and Verify**:\n   - Assistant, review the extracted information to ensure it is accurate and complete.\n   - Provide the formatted list of JSON objects with the shipping costs.\n\nPlease proceed with the steps outlined above."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nHow much does it cost to send an envelope with 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with DHL, USPS, or Fedex? (Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sender is located in Rio de Janeiro.\n   - The recipient is located in New York City (NYC).\n   - The delivery time frame is 1 week.\n   - The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - The official website of DHL encountered a technical issue when accessed, preventing the retrieval of shipping rates.\n   - The USPS price calculator requires specific details such as the weight of the envelope and the value of the item being mailed.\n   - The average weight of a standard envelope is approximately 11.25 grams when containing a single sheet of paper.\n   - The typical value of a non-negotiable document is estimated at $100 for the purpose of this calculation.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC.\n   - Specific 1-week delivery options and their associated costs for DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping from Brazil to the USA.\n   - The official websites of USPS and FedEx for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n   - The weight and value of the envelope to input into the USPS price calculator.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping option, including any additional fees or taxes.\n   - Whether the 1-week delivery time frame is achievable with the standard services offered by each carrier, or if expedited services are required.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - DHL, USPS, and FedEx all offer international shipping services, but the exact costs and options may vary.\n   - The cost of shipping an envelope internationally is likely to be higher than domestic shipping due to longer distances and customs handling.\n   - Additional fees such as customs duties, VAT, or handling charges may apply, especially for international shipments.\n   - Given the technical issues with the DHL website, it might be more efficient to use alternative methods to obtain DHL shipping rates, such as contacting their customer service or using a third-party shipping calculator.\n   - FedEx and USPS websites are likely to provide more reliable and accessible rate calculators for international shipping.\n   - The USPS price calculator may require more detailed information to provide accurate rates, such as the weight of the envelope and the value of the item being mailed.\n   - FedEx's website encountered a system error, which may require using a third-party shipping calculator or contacting customer service for accurate rates.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The technical issues with both the DHL and FedEx websites suggest that direct access might not be the most reliable method for obtaining shipping rates. Alternative methods, such as contacting customer service or using third-party tools, could provide more accurate and timely information.\n- FedEx and USPS are known for having robust and user-friendly rate calculators, which are likely to be more accessible and provide the necessary information without technical issues.\n- The USPS price calculator requires specific details to provide accurate rates, which means we need to gather more information about the envelope, such as its weight and value.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to USPS Website**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to directly navigate to the official USPS (https://www.usps.com) website.\n   - Locate the international shipping rate calculator on this website.\n\n2. **Input Required Details for USPS**:\n   - For USPS, input the following details into the rate calculator:\n     - Sender location: Rio de Janeiro\n     - Recipient location: New York City\n     - Item type: Envelope\n     - Desired delivery time: 1 week\n     - Weight of the envelope: 11.25 grams\n     - Value of the item being mailed: $100\n\n3. **Extract Cost Estimates and Additional Fees for USPS**:\n   - Extract the cost estimates for each shipping option.\n   - Note any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping.\n\n4. **Use Third-Party Shipping Calculator for FedEx**:\n   - Use a third-party shipping calculator or find the contact information for FedEx customer service.\n   - Input the same details as for USPS into the third-party calculator or contact customer service for accurate rates.\n\n5. **Contact DHL Customer Service**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to find the contact information for DHL customer service.\n   - Contact DHL customer service via phone or email to inquire about the shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery time frame.\n\n6. **Compile and Format Results**:\n   - Compile the gathered information into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n   - Ensure the information is accurate and up-to-date.\n\n7. **Double-Check and Verify**:\n   - Review the extracted information to ensure it is accurate and complete.\n   - Provide the formatted list of JSON objects with the shipping costs.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to USPS Website**:\n   - WebSurfer, please navigate to the official USPS website (https://www.usps.com) and locate the international shipping rate calculator.\n   - Input the following details:\n     - Sender location: Rio de Janeiro\n     - Recipient location: New York City\n     - Item type: Envelope\n     - Desired delivery time: 1 week\n     - Weight of the envelope: 11.25 grams\n     - Value of the item being mailed: $100\n\n2. **Extract USPS Cost Estimate**:\n   - WebSurfer, extract the cost estimate and any additional fees or taxes that may apply.\n\n3. **Use Third-Party Shipping Calculator for FedEx**:\n   - WebSurfer, please find a reputable third-party shipping calculator or the contact information for FedEx customer service.\n   - Input the same details as for USPS into the third-party calculator or contact customer service for accurate rates.\n\n4. **Contact DHL Customer Service**:\n   - WebSurfer, find the contact information for DHL customer service.\n   - Contact DHL customer service via phone or email to inquire about the shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery time frame.\n\n5. **Compile and Format Results**:\n   - Assistant, compile the gathered information into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n\n6. **Double-Check and Verify**:\n   - Assistant, review the extracted information to ensure it is accurate and complete.\n   - Provide the formatted list of JSON objects with the shipping costs.\n\nPlease proceed with the steps outlined above.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetition of Steps**: We repeatedly navigated to the same pages and inputted the same information without addressing the underlying issues.\n- **Incomplete Information**: The USPS price calculator requires specific details such as the weight of the envelope and the value of the item being mailed, which were not consistently provided.\n- **Technical Issues**: Both the DHL and FedEx websites encountered technical issues, preventing us from accessing the rate calculators directly.\n- **Lack of Alternative Methods**: We did not effectively use alternative methods, such as third-party shipping calculators or customer service, to obtain the required information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Gather Required Information**:\n   - **Weight and Value**: Confirm the weight of the envelope (11.25 grams) and the value of the item being mailed ($100).\n\n2. **Navigate to USPS Website**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the official USPS website (https://www.usps.com).\n   - **Locate Calculator**: Find the international shipping rate calculator.\n   - **Input Details**:\n     - Sender location: Rio de Janeiro\n     - Recipient location: New York City\n     - Item type: Envelope\n     - Weight: 11.25 grams\n     - Value: $100\n     - Desired delivery time: 1 week\n   - **Extract Costs**: Record the cost estimate and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n3. **Use Third-Party Shipping Calculator for FedEx**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for a reputable third-party shipping calculator.\n   - **Input Details**:\n     - Sender location: Rio de Janeiro\n     - Recipient location: New York City\n     - Item type: Envelope\n     - Weight: 11.25 grams\n     - Value: $100\n     - Desired delivery time: 1 week\n   - **Extract Costs**: Record the cost estimate and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n4. **Contact DHL Customer Service**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Find the contact information for DHL customer service.\n   - **Contact Customer Service**: Call or email DHL customer service to inquire about the shipping rates for an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with a 1-week delivery time frame.\n   - **Extract Costs**: Record the cost estimate and any additional fees or taxes.\n\n5. **Compile and Format Results**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the gathered information into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n   - **Example**:\n     ```json\n     [\n       { \"sender\": \"USPS\", \"price (usd)\": 25.00 },\n       { \"sender\": \"FedEx\", \"price (usd)\": 30.00 },\n       { \"sender\": \"DHL\", \"price (usd)\": 35.00 }\n     ]\n     ```\n\n6. **Double-Check and Verify**:\n   -
