{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the worst rated series (according to Rotten Tomatoes) with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series must be rated according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n   - We are looking for the worst-rated series based on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of all series starring Ted Danson.\n   - The number of seasons for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - The Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Filter the list of series to include only those with more than 1 season.\n   - Identify which of these series are available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Determine the Rotten Tomatoes rating for each of the filtered series.\n   - Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating from the filtered list.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Ted Danson has starred in several series, including \"Cheers,\" \"The Good Place,\" \"Damages,\" \"Becker,\" \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,\" \"Fargo,\" \"Help Me Help You,\" and \"A Man on the Inside.\"\n   - \"The Good Place\" has 4 seasons and is highly rated (97% on Rotten Tomatoes), so it is unlikely to be the worst-rated series.\n   - \"Damages\" has 5 seasons and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 91%, so it is also unlikely to be the worst-rated series.\n   - \"Becker\" has 6 seasons and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 85%, so it is also unlikely to be the worst-rated series.\n   - \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" has 17 seasons and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 80%, so it is a potential candidate for the worst-rated series among those with more than 1 season.\n   - \"Fargo\" has 5 seasons and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 93%, so it is unlikely to be the worst-rated series.\n   - \"Help Me Help You\" has 1 season and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 50%, but it does not meet the criteria of having more than 1 season.\n   - \"A Man on the Inside\" has 2 seasons and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 96%, so it is unlikely to be the worst-rated series.\n   - \"A Man on the Inside\" is available on Netflix, but we need to confirm its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n5. **NEW INFORMATION**\n   - \"A Man on the Inside\" has 2 seasons and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 96%. It is available on Netflix.\n   - \"Help Me Help You\" has 1 season and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 50%, but it does not meet the criteria of having more than 1 season.\n   - \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" has 17 seasons and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 80%, making it a strong candidate for the worst-rated series among those with more than 1 season.\n   - \"Becker\" has 6 seasons and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 85%.\n   - \"Damages\" has 5 seasons and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 91%.\n   - \"Fargo\" has 5 seasons and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 93%.\n\n6. **NEXT STEPS**\n   - Confirm the availability of \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Confirm the availability of \"Becker\" on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Verify if there are any other series starring Ted Danson that meet the criteria and have not been checked yet.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect URLs and Search Queries**:\n   - The URLs used to search for the availability of \"Help Me Help You\" and \"A Man on the Inside\" on Amazon Prime Video (US) were incorrect or led to irrelevant pages.\n   - The search queries did not yield direct links to the series on Amazon Prime Video, leading to confusion and incorrect conclusions.\n\n2. **Lack of Direct Verification**:\n   - Instead of directly checking the availability of the series on Amazon Prime Video (US), the search led to general help pages or unrelated results.\n   - The process of verifying the availability of the series on Amazon Prime Video (US) was not clearly defined or executed.\n\n3. **Incomplete Information Gathering**:\n   - The Rotten Tomatoes ratings and number of seasons for some series were not fully verified before checking their availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Verify Rotten Tomatoes Ratings and Number of Seasons**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Rotten Tomatoes pages for the following series starring Ted Danson:\n     - \"Cheers\"\n     - \"The Good Place\"\n     - \"Damages\"\n     - \"Becker\"\n     - \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"\n     - \"Fargo\"\n     - \"Help Me Help You\"\n     - \"A Man on the Inside\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract and verify the number of seasons and Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series.\n\n2. **Filter Series with More Than 1 Season**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile a list of series that have more than 1 season and their Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Amazon Prime Video (US) site and search for each series in the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n4. **Identify the Worst-Rated Series**:\n   - **Assistant**: From the list of series that are available on Amazon Prime Video (US), identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Verify Rotten Tomatoes Ratings and Number of Seasons**:\n   -

He hires smart, uptight -- and jilted -- Diane Chambers as a server, out of sympathy, but their attraction causes constant bickering. Wacky characters fill the bar: sarcastic waitress Carla, beer-loving accountant Norm, know-it-all postman Cliff. When Diane leaves Boston much later, Sam sells the bar, buys a boat and sails the world, but his boat sinks, so he returns. New, ambitious manager Rebecca Howe hires him back, but they love to hate each other too. \nWatch on Fandango at Home\n Buy Now \nWhere to Watch\nSeasons\nCast & Crew\nMore Like This\nRelated News\nPhotos\nMedia Info\nWhat to Watch\nIn Theaters\nAt Home\nTV Shows\nNew TV Tonight\n View All \nNew TV TonightUntamed\n88%\nRevival\n93%\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds\n95%\nSuch Brave Girls\n100%\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"TVSeries\",\n        \"actor\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Ted Danson\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ted_danson\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/mbpkYQOqQ9xCBz8C3msqV7To5c0=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/GNLZZGG0024P4MZ.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Rhea Perlman\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/rhea_perlman\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/C7xJMxIyN8QSkY42kcUs2bslZKQ=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/1336_v9_bb.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"George Wendt\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/george_wendt\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/udOIh_ycjQHdJXY426XUzvgoRA0=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/1905_v9_ba.jpg\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"aggregateRating\": {\n            \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n            \"bestRating\": \"100\",\n            \"description\": \"The Tomatometer rating \\u2013 based on the published opinions of hundreds of film and television critics \\u2013 is a trusted measurement of movie and TV programming quality for millions of moviegoers.

Her seemingly perfect neighbors, Tahani and Jason, and open-hearted soul mate, Chidi, help her realize that it's never too late to change.

However, that may end when Patty's son, Michael, sues for custody of the little girl. When Patty's protege, Ellen Parsons, agrees to testify as a character witness for Michael at the custody trial, Patty scrambles to prevent her from taking the stand, fearing that Ellen will reveal Patty's secrets. To prevent the testimony, Patty refers Channing McClaren, a famous computer hacker, to Ellen, knowing that she will not be able to resist taking on such a high-profile client having just launched her own firm. When Patty files a lawsuit against McClaren -- whom Ellen has agreed to represent -- the judge in the custody case rules that Ellen cannot take the stand until the McClaren case is resolved. \nWatch on Fandango at Home\n Buy Now \nWhere to Watch\nSeasons\nCast & Crew\nMore Like This\nPhotos\nMedia Info\nWhat to Watch\nIn Theaters\nAt Home\nTV Shows\nNew TV Tonight\n View All \nNew TV TonightUntamed\n88%\nRevival\n93%\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds\n95%\nSuch Brave Girls\n100%\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"TVSeries\",\n        \"actor\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Glenn Close\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/glenn_close\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/A-ZqXYk0nogufeGFI_sTOvSeGug=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/337_v9_bc.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Rose Byrne\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/rose_byrne\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/QF-hAGSv2UHWra5LmnuwRHxva2g=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/84172_v9_bb.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Ryan Phillippe\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ryan_philippe\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/145d8hW4Cw0U5PsclY8Csly7tg4=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/74089_v9_bc.jpg\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"aggregateRating\": {\n            \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n            \"bestRating\": \"100\",\n            \"description\": \"The Tomatometer rating \\u2013 based on the published opinions of hundreds of film and television critics \\u2013 is a trusted measurement of movie and TV programming quality for millions of moviegoers.
