What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The location or database where the most relevant dog genome files can be accessed as of May 2020.\n   - The specific file names or identifiers for the most relevant dog genome data as of May 2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No facts need to be derived from the given information. The focus is on locating the correct files and their sources.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant dog genome files in May 2020 are likely to be hosted on a major genomics database such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or Ensembl.\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly in May 2020 might be CanFam3.1, which was a significant update to the earlier assemblies.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the most relevant dog genome assembly as of May 2020**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find the most relevant version of the dog genome assembly as of May 2020.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the official NCBI or Ensembl pages to locate the specific version and its release date.\n\n- **Locate the specific files for the identified genome assembly**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the download section of the identified genome assembly on the NCBI or Ensembl website.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the specific file names and download links for the most relevant files.\n\n- **Verify the correctness of the files**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the file names and metadata with any available documentation or release notes to ensure they are the most relevant as of May 2020.\n\n- **Provide the link to the files**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Copy the direct download link(s) for the identified files.\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the link(s) to the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe dog genome was first mapped in 2004 and has been updated several times since. What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and refined educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The Broad Institute has been the steward of the high-quality dog genome reference assembly, with the latest version being an improved version of the original Sanger 7x build.\n   - The CanFam3.1 reference assembly is available via NCBI and provides the backbone for viewing genomic data on the UCSC Genome Browser.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The location or database where the most relevant dog genome files can be accessed as of May 2020.\n   - The specific file names or identifiers for the most relevant dog genome data as of May 2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No facts need to be derived from the given information. The focus is on locating the correct files and their sources.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant dog genome files in May 2020 are likely to be hosted on a major genomics database such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or Ensembl.\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly in May 2020 is likely to be CanFam3.1, as it is the latest and most improved version mentioned by the Broad Institute.\n   - The NCBI FTP site is a reliable source for downloading the CanFam3.1 reference assembly files. The FTP link should provide direct access to the necessary files.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The Broad Institute's involvement and their mention of CanFam3.1 as the latest version strongly suggest that CanFam3.1 was the most relevant assembly in May 2020.\n- NCBI is a well-established and trusted repository for genomic data, making it a logical choice for hosting the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n- The FTP site is typically used for large data downloads in the scientific community, making it the most likely place to find the specific files needed.\n\nNext Steps:\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the NCBI FTP site for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly and locate the specific download links for the files.\n- **WebSurfer**: Verify the file names and identifiers for the most relevant dog genome data as of May 2020.\n- **WebSurfer**: Copy the direct download link(s) for the identified files.\n- **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the link(s) to the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetitive Navigation**: The WebSurfer repeatedly navigated back to the same page on the Broad Institute website, even after clicking the FTP link. This suggests that the link was either not correctly identified or the navigation did not proceed as expected.\n- **Lack of Direct Link Extraction**: The WebSurfer did not successfully extract the direct FTP link to the CanFam3.1 reference assembly files. This could be due to the link being embedded in a different format or not being directly clickable.\n- **Insufficient Verification**: There was no verification step to ensure that the WebSurfer had actually navigated to the correct FTP page.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Identify the Correct FTP Link**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"CanFam3.1 reference assembly FTP NCBI\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the first relevant result from NCBI that provides the FTP link for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n\n2. **Navigate to the FTP Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the FTP link to navigate to the NCBI FTP page for CanFam3.1.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the page contains the expected file listings for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n\n3. **Extract Direct Download Links**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify and extract the direct download links for the most relevant files (e.g., the FASTA file for the genome assembly, GFF3 file for annotations).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure that the links are correct and lead to the actual files.\n\n4. **Compile the Final Answer**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the direct download links for the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Identify the Correct FTP Link**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"CanFam3.1 reference assembly FTP NCBI\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open the first relevant result from NCBI that provides the FTP link for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n\n- **Step 2: Navigate to the FTP Page**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on the FTP link to navigate to the NCBI FTP page for CanFam3.1.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the page contains the expected file listings for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n\n- **Step 3: Extract Direct Download Links**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify and extract the direct download links for the most relevant files (e.g., the FASTA file for the genome assembly, GFF3 file for annotations).\n  - **WebSurfer**: Ensure that the links are correct and lead to the actual files.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the direct download links for the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Ensure Correct Link Identification**: Double-check that the FTP link is correctly identified and clicked.\n- **Verify Navigation**: Confirm that the WebSurfer has navigated to the correct FTP page by verifying the URL and the content of the page.\n- **Extract Links Carefully**: Carefully extract the direct download links to avoid any errors or broken links.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe dog genome was first mapped in 2004 and has been updated several times since. What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and refined educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The Broad Institute has been the steward of the high-quality dog genome reference assembly, with the latest version being an improved version of the original Sanger 7x build.\n   - The CanFam3.1 reference assembly is available via NCBI and provides the backbone for viewing genomic data on the UCSC Genome Browser.\n   - Access to the NCBI FTP site can sometimes be blocked due to potential misuse/abuse situations, which can temporarily restrict access.\n   - The UCSC Genome Browser provides a gateway to the CanFam3.1 assembly, including options to download sequence and annotation data.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The location or database where the most relevant dog genome files can be accessed as of May 2020.\n   - The specific file names or identifiers for the most relevant dog genome data as of May 2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No facts need to be derived from the given information. The focus is on locating the correct files and their sources.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant dog genome files in May 2020 are likely to be hosted on a major genomics database such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or Ensembl.\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly in May 2020 is likely to be CanFam3.1, as it is the latest and most improved version mentioned by the Broad Institute.\n   - The NCBI FTP site is a reliable source for downloading the CanFam3.1 reference assembly files. However, due to potential access issues, alternative methods or mirrors might be necessary.\n   - The UCSC Genome Browser is another reliable source for downloading the CanFam3.1 reference assembly files, which can serve as an alternative to the NCBI FTP site.\n   - The UCSC Genome Browser provides direct download links for the CanFam3.1 assembly, including the FASTA file for the genome assembly and the GFF3 file for annotations.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The Broad Institute's involvement and their mention of CanFam3.1 as the latest version strongly suggest that CanFam3.1 was the most relevant assembly in May 2020.\n- NCBI is a well-established and trusted repository for genomic data, but access issues can arise. Therefore, considering alternative sources like the UCSC Genome Browser is prudent.\n- The FTP site is typically used for large data downloads in the scientific community, but given the access issues, other methods should be explored.\n- The UCSC Genome Browser is known for providing comprehensive and accessible data, making it a reliable alternative for downloading the CanFam3.1 reference assembly files.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"CanFam3.1 reference assembly UCSC\" to find the UCSC Genome Browser page for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser page for CanFam3.1 and locate the specific download links for the files.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Verify the file names and identifiers for the most relevant dog genome data as of May 2020.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Copy the direct download link(s) for the identified files.\n5. **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the link(s) to the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Search for UCSC Genome Browser Page**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"CanFam3.1 reference assembly UCSC\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open the first relevant result from UCSC that provides the download links for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n\n- **Step 2: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser Page**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on the link to navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser page for CanFam3.1.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the page contains the expected file listings for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n\n- **Step 3: Extract Direct Download Links**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify and extract the direct download links for the most relevant files (e.g., the FASTA file for the genome assembly, GFF3 file for annotations).\n  - **WebSurfer**: Ensure that the links are correct and lead to the actual files.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the direct download links for the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Ensure Correct Link Identification**: Double-check that the UCSC link is correctly identified and clicked.\n- **Verify Navigation**: Confirm that the WebSurfer has navigated to the correct UCSC page by verifying the URL and the content of the page.\n- **Extract Links Carefully**: Carefully extract the direct download links to avoid any errors or broken links.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. Perform a web search for \"CanFam3.1 reference assembly UCSC\". Open the first relevant result from UCSC that provides the download links for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly. Once on the UCSC page, verify that it contains the expected file listings for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: Despite reaching the UCSC Genome Browser Gateway page, we did not navigate to the specific section for downloading the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: We did not explicitly click on the 'Download sequence and annotation data' section to extract the direct download links.\n- **Repetition of Steps**: We repeatedly navigated to the same page without advancing to the next step of extracting the download links.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"CanFam3.1 reference assembly UCSC\".\n2. **WebSurfer**: Open the first relevant result from UCSC that provides the download links for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the 'Download sequence and annotation data' section on the UCSC Genome Browser page for CanFam3.1.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Identify and extract the direct download links for the most relevant files (e.g., the FASTA file for the genome assembly, GFF3 file for annotations).\n5. **WebSurfer**: Ensure that the links are correct and lead to the actual files.\n6. **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the link(s) to the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Search for UCSC Genome Browser Page**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"CanFam3.1 reference assembly UCSC\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open the first relevant result from UCSC that provides the download links for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n\n- **Step 2: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser Page**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on the link to navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser page for CanFam3.1.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the page contains the expected file listings for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n\n- **Step 3: Extract Direct Download Links**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the 'Download sequence and annotation data' section.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify and extract the direct download links for the most relevant files (e.g., the FASTA file for the genome assembly, GFF3 file for annotations).\n  - **WebSurfer**: Ensure that the links are correct and lead to the actual files.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the direct download links for the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Ensure Correct Link Identification**: Double-check that the UCSC link is correctly identified and clicked.\n- **Verify Navigation**: Confirm that the WebSurfer has navigated to the correct UCSC page by verifying the URL and the content of the page.\n- **Extract Links Carefully**: Carefully extract the direct download links to avoid any errors or broken links.\n- **Scroll to the Correct Section**: Explicitly scroll to the 'Download sequence and annotation data' section to ensure the correct files are identified.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan.

Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and refined educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The Broad Institute has been the steward of the high-quality dog genome reference assembly, with the latest version being an improved version of the original Sanger 7x build.\n   - The CanFam3.1 reference assembly is available via NCBI and provides the backbone for viewing genomic data on the UCSC Genome Browser.\n   - Access to the NCBI FTP site can sometimes be blocked due to potential misuse/abuse situations, which can temporarily restrict access.\n   - The UCSC Genome Browser provides a gateway to the CanFam3.1 assembly, including options to download sequence and annotation data.\n   - The UCSC Genome Browser Gateway page for CanFam3.1 includes a section for downloading sequence and annotation data using FTP or HTTP.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific file names or identifiers for the most relevant dog genome data as of May 2020.\n   - The direct download links for these files from the UCSC Genome Browser.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No additional facts need to be derived from the given information. The focus is on locating the correct files and their sources.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant dog genome files in May 2020 are likely to be hosted on a major genomics database such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or Ensembl.\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly in May 2020 is CanFam3.1, as it is the latest and most improved version mentioned by the Broad Institute.\n   - The UCSC Genome Browser is a reliable source for downloading the CanFam3.1 reference assembly files, which can serve as an alternative to the NCBI FTP site.\n   - The UCSC Genome Browser provides direct download links for the CanFam3.1 assembly, including the FASTA file for the genome assembly and the GFF3 file for annotations.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The Broad Institute's involvement and their mention of CanFam3.1 as the latest version strongly suggest that CanFam3.1 was the most relevant assembly in May 2020.\n- The UCSC Genome Browser is known for providing comprehensive and accessible data, making it a reliable alternative for downloading the CanFam3.1 reference assembly files.\n- Given the access issues with the NCBI FTP site, the UCSC Genome Browser is a more practical and accessible option.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser Gateway page for CanFam3.1.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Locate the 'Download sequence and annotation data' section.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download links for the most relevant files (e.g., the FASTA file for the genome assembly, GFF3 file for annotations).\n4. **WebSurfer**: Ensure that the links are correct and lead to the actual files.\n5. **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the link(s) to the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser Page**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Go to the UCSC Genome Browser Gateway page for CanFam3.1 at the following URL: `https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway`.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the page contains the expected file listings for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n\n- **Step 2: Locate the 'Download sequence and annotation data' Section**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the 'Download sequence and annotation data' section on the page.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the options for downloading the files using FTP or HTTP.\n\n- **Step 3: Extract Direct Download Links**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify and extract the direct download links for the most relevant files (e.g., the FASTA file for the genome assembly, GFF3 file for annotations).\n  - **WebSurfer**: Ensure that the links are correct and lead to the actual files.\n\n- **Step 4: Compile the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the direct download links for the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Ensure Correct Link Identification**: Double-check that the UCSC link is correctly identified and clicked.\n- **Verify Navigation**: Confirm that the WebSurfer has navigated to the correct UCSC page by verifying the URL and the content of the page.\n- **Extract Links Carefully**: Carefully extract the direct download links to avoid any errors or broken links.\n- **Scroll to the Correct Section**: Explicitly scroll to the 'Download sequence and annotation data' section to ensure the correct files are identified.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser Gateway page for CanFam3.1 at `https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway`. Once on the page, scroll down to the 'Download sequence and annotation data' section and extract the direct download links for the most relevant files (e.g., the FASTA file for the genome assembly, GFF3 file for annotations). Ensure that the links are correct and lead to the actual files.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: Despite reaching the UCSC Genome Browser Gateway page, we did not navigate to the specific section for downloading the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: We did not explicitly click on the 'Download sequence and annotation data' section to extract the direct download links.\n- **Repetition of Steps**: We repeatedly navigated to the same page without advancing to the next step of extracting the download links.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser Gateway page for CanFam3.1 at `https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway`.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the 'Download sequence and annotation data' section.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Using FTP (recommended)' link to navigate to the FTP directory.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Identify and extract the direct download links for the most relevant files (e.g., the FASTA file for the genome assembly, GFF3 file for annotations).\n5. **WebSurfer**: Ensure that the links are correct and lead to the actual files.\n6. **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the link(s) to the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser Page**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Go to the UCSC Genome Browser Gateway page for CanFam3.1 at the following URL: `https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway`.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the page contains the expected file listings for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n\n- **Step 2: Locate the 'Download sequence and annotation data' Section**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the 'Download sequence and annotation data' section on the page.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the options for downloading the files using FTP or HTTP.\n\n- **Step 3: Navigate to the FTP Directory**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Using FTP (recommended)' link to navigate to the FTP directory for CanFam3.1.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the FTP directory contains the expected file listings for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n\n- **Step 4: Extract Direct Download Links**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify and extract the direct download links for the most relevant files (e.g., the FASTA file for the genome assembly, GFF3 file for annotations).\n  - **WebSurfer**: Ensure that the links are correct and lead to the actual files.\n\n- **Step 5: Compile the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the direct download links for the most relevant dog genome files as of May 2020.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Ensure Correct Link Identification**: Double-check that the UCSC link is correctly identified and clicked.\n- **Verify Navigation**: Confirm that the WebSurfer has navigated to the correct UCSC page by verifying the URL and the content of the page.\n- **Extract Links Carefully**: Carefully extract the direct download links to avoid any errors or broken links.\n- **Scroll to the Correct Section**: Explicitly scroll to the 'Download sequence and annotation data' section to ensure the correct files are identified.\n- **Click on FTP Link**: Ensure that the 'Using FTP (recommended)' link is clicked to navigate to the FTP directory.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan.
