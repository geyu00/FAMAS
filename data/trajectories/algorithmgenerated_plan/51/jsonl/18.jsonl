However, the script is currently returning an error. We need to debug the script and correct it.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Review the provided Python script to identify any syntax or logical errors.\n2. Correct the identified errors in the script.\n3. Test the corrected script with a sample input to ensure it works as expected.\n\n## Output format\n- The corrected Python script\n- The output of the script when tested with a sample input\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The script should correctly process the list of numbers and return the sum of the squares of the even numbers.\n- The script should handle edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with no even numbers.\n\n## Provided Python script\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\nresult = sum_of_squares_even(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```"}
{"agent": "PythonDebugging_Expert", "content": "Let's begin by reviewing the provided Python script. The script looks mostly correct and seems to implement the required functionality of summing the squares of even numbers in the list. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Reviewing the Script**: The function `sum_of_squares_even` takes a list of numbers, iterates through them, checks if each number is even, squares it if it is, and adds it to a running total.\n\n2. **Identifying Errors**: The error message \"Function seek_experts_help not found\" indicates there may have been a problem with finding a function in the context of the original issue but does not seem to relate directly to the script provided.\n\n3. **Testing Edge Cases**: We will ensure that the function can handle an empty list and a list with no even numbers.\n\n4. **Testing**: We'll run the existing script with both the provided input and some additional test cases.\n\nNow, let's write the complete code including the original script and additional test cases. \n\n### Corrected Python Script\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\n# Testing with original numbers\nresult = sum_of_squares_even(numbers)\nprint(\"Sum of squares of even numbers:\", result)\n\n# Edge case: empty list\nempty_list = []\nresult_empty = sum_of_squares_even(empty_list)\nprint(\"Sum of squares of even numbers (empty list):\", result_empty)\n\n# Edge case: no even numbers\nno_even_list = [1, 3, 5, 7]\nresult_no_even = sum_of_squares_even(no_even_list)\nprint(\"Sum of squares of even numbers (no even numbers):\", result_no_even)\n```\n\nNow, I'll send this code to the Computer_terminal for execution."}
