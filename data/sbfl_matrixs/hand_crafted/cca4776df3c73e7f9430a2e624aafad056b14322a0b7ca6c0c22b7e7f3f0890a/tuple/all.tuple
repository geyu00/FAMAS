{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "action": "instruct", "state": "We are working to address the following user request: Which member of Apple\u2019s Board of Directors did not hold C-suite positions at their companies when they joined the board? To answer this request we have assembled the following team: Assistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills. ComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks). FileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files. WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded. Here is an initial fact sheet to consider: ### Updated Fact Sheet 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS - The question asks about a member of Apple's Board of Directors. - The question specifies that the member did not hold C-suite positions at their companies when they joined the board. - The current members of Apple's Board of Directors are: - Arthur D. Levinson: Founder and CEO, Calico; Chair of the Board; People and Compensation Committee - Wanda Austin: Former President and CEO, The Aerospace Corporation; Audit and Finance Committee - Tim Cook: CEO, Apple - Alex Gorsky: Former Chair and CEO, Johnson & Johnson; People and Compensation Committee; Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee - Andrea Jung: President and CEO, Grameen America; People and Compensation Committee Chair; Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee - Monica Lozano: Former President and CEO, College Futures Foundation; Audit and Finance Committee - Ronald D. Sugar: Former Chair and CEO, Northrop Grumman Corporation; Audit and Finance Committee Chair - Susan L. Wagner: Co-founder and Director, BlackRock; Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chair 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP - The professional backgrounds of each current board member, specifically focusing on whether they held C-suite positions at their respective companies before joining Apple's board. - This information can be found on Apple's official website, particularly in the corporate governance section, as well as in press releases and biographies of the board members. 3. FACTS TO DERIVE - Determining which board member(s) did not hold C-suite positions at their companies when they joined Apple's board will require comparing the timing of their board appointment with their career history. - This may involve cross-referencing the dates they joined the board with the dates they held various positions in their careers. 4. EDUCATED GUESSES - Monica Lozano: Given her background as the former President and CEO of College Futures Foundation, it is likely that she held a C-suite position. However, the nature of non-profit organizations sometimes means that titles may not always align with traditional corporate hierarchies. It is worth investigating if her role was more administrative or if she had a different title before joining the board. - Wanda Austin: As a former President and CEO of The Aerospace Corporation, she likely held a C-suite position. However, the specific context of The Aerospace Corporation and the timing of her board appointment need verification. Her early career might have been in more technical or research-oriented roles, and it is possible that she did not hold a C-suite position until later in her career. - Arthur D. Levinson: As the Founder and CEO of Calico, he has held a C-suite position. However, his involvement in multiple startups and research organizations might provide some nuance. - Susan L. Wagner: As a Co-founder and Director of BlackRock, it is highly likely that she has held a C-suite position, given BlackRock's prominence in the financial sector. - Andrea Jung: As the President and CEO of Grameen America, she has held a C-suite position. However, her background in non-profit and social impact organizations might offer some unique insights. - Ronald D. Sugar: As a former Chair and CEO of Northrop Grumman Corporation, he has held a C-suite position. - Alex Gorsky: As a former Chair and CEO of Johnson & Johnson, he has held a C-suite position. - Tim Cook: As the CEO of Apple, he has held a C-suite position. New Educated Guess: - Wanda Austin: While her role as President and CEO of The Aerospace Corporation suggests a C-suite position, it is worth noting that her early career might have been in more technical or research-oriented roles. It is possible that she did not hold a C-suite position until later in her career. Therefore, it is important to verify the exact timeline of her career and when she joined Apple's board. Given her extensive technical background, it is plausible that she might have joined Apple's board before reaching a C-suite position. ### Next Steps 1. WebSurfer: Visit the individual profiles of the board members on Apple's official website to gather detailed information about their professional backgrounds, focusing on the specific dates and positions they held before joining the board. 2. WebSurfer: Extract and summarize the professional background of each board member, focusing on the positions they held before joining Apple's board. 3. WebSurfer: Note the dates when each board member joined Apple's board. 4. WebSurfer: Compare these dates with the dates they held various positions in their careers to determine if they held C-suite positions at the time of joining. 5. Assistant: Identify the board member who did not hold a C-suite position at their company when they joined Apple's board. 6. WebSurfer: If necessary, verify the findings by cross-referencing with additional sources to ensure accuracy. 7. Assistant: Compile the final answer and provide it in a clear and concise manner. ### Detailed Steps 1. Navigate to the Board of Directors Section - WebSurfer: Open the URL https://investor.apple.com/leadership-and-governance/default.aspx. - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the section listing the current members of the Board of Directors. 2. Extract Board Member Names and Roles - WebSurfer: List the names and roles of each board member. 3. Visit Individual Profiles - WebSurfer: Click on the name or profile link of each board member to navigate to their detailed biography page. - WebSurfer: Extract and summarize the professional background of each board member, focusing on the positions they held before joining Apple's board. 4. Note Joining Dates - WebSurfer: Note the dates when each board member joined Apple's board. 5. Cross-Reference Dates and Positions - WebSurfer: Compare the dates they joined the board with the dates they held various positions in their careers to determine if they held C-suite positions at the time of joining. 6. Identify the Member - Assistant: Identify the board member who did not hold a C-suite position at their company when they joined Apple's board. 7. Verify and Report - WebSurfer: If necessary, verify the findings by cross-referencing with additional sources to ensure accuracy. - Assistant: Compile the final answer and provide it in a clear and concise manner. Let's start by navigating to the board member profiles and extracting the necessary information. Step 1: Navigate to the Board of Directors Section - WebSurfer: Open the URL https://investor.apple.com/leadership-and-governance/default.aspx. - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the section listing the current members of the Board of Directors."}

Dr. Austin brings extensive experience in science and technology, having led The Aerospace Corporation, an organization dedicated to supporting the U.S. space program. She is the first woman and the first African American to hold the position of president and CEO at The Aerospace Corporation. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and the chair of Apple\u2019s board of directors, Arthur Levinson, praised Dr. Austin\u2019s leadership and expertise. Additionally, the board has a policy that directors generally may not stand for reelection after reaching age 75, leading to the retirement of Al Gore and James Bell this year. Both have served Apple for many years, contributing significantly to the company's growth and values. Dr. Austin holds a Ph.D. in industrial and systems engineering and is a strong advocate for STEM education."}
