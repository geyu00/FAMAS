Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The paper in question is titled \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?\"\n   - The paper was published by the University of Leicester.\n   - The specific information requested is the volume in m³ of the fish bag.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact volume in m³ of the fish bag as stated in the University of Leicester paper \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?\"\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: The University of Leicester's official repository or academic database where the paper is published.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No derivations are necessary if the volume is directly stated in the paper.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The volume of the fish bag is likely to be a specific figure mentioned in the paper, but without access to the paper, it cannot be accurately guessed.\n   - Given the context of the paper, the volume might be in the range of tens to hundreds of cubic meters, considering the size of dragons and the quantity of fish required to feed them. However, this is purely speculative.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for the University of Leicester paper titled \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?\" using a web search engine.\n- **WebSurfer**: Once the paper is located, open the PDF or online version of the paper.\n- **WebSurfer**: Locate the section or table where the volume of the fish bag is mentioned and extract the specific figure in m³.\n- **Assistant**: Verify the extracted information and format the final answer."}

In the 2010 film, Toothless is struck down during a dragon raid and loses his left tail-fin, leaving him trapped in a sunken area. This paper investigates the feasibility of Hiccup, a teenage boy, being able to supply enough fish to maintain the dragon’s diet by catching and bringing fish to him. It was found that in the twelve days that Toothless was trapped, he would have required 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, which totalled 716 kg. Hiccup would have had to carry 828 fish weighing at total of 8592 kg over the twelve days, which is unrealistic since he struggles to lift a shield in combat.\n PDF \n How to Cite \nDoua, A. (2017).
