Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify the contributor to OpenCV 4.1.2 who has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Identify the contributors to OpenCV 4.1.2.\n2. Compare the names of the contributors with the names of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n\n## Output format\n- Name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n- Evidence of the match (e.g., links to GitHub profiles, historical records).\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure the accuracy of the OpenCV version and contributors.\n- Correctly identify the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n- Provide a clear and concise answer with verifiable evidence."}
