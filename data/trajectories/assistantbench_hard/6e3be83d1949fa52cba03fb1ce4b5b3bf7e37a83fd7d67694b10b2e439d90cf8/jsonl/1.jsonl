{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and progress we've made:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time for classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n   - The exact address of the New York Stock Exchange is 11 Wall St, New York City, NY 10005.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of martial arts studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The class schedules of these martial arts studios to confirm if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n     - Google Maps or a similar mapping service to find martial arts studios within the specified radius.\n     - The websites or social media pages of the identified martial arts studios for their class schedules.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The actual walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified martial arts studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n   - The availability of evening classes (7-9 pm) at the identified studios, which may require checking multiple days to ensure consistent scheduling.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely several fitness and martial arts studios in the Financial District area due to the high concentration of office workers.\n   - Popular martial arts styles like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, and Krav Maga might be available, as they are common in urban areas.\n   - Studios in the area may cater to professionals, offering flexible evening hours to accommodate after-work training.\n   - Based on the initial search, some potential martial arts studios within the vicinity include:\n     - **Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street** (22 New St)\n     - **Modern Martial Arts Tribeca** (78 Reade St)\n     - **Martial Arts Family Studio** (290 Mulberry St)\n     - **Anderson's Martial Arts Academy** (12 E 14th St)\n     - **Workshop NYC Muay Thai & Jiujitsu** (92 Delancey St)\n   - These studios are likely to have evening classes, but we need to verify the specific times.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n1. **Verify Class Schedules:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Visit the websites or social media pages of the identified martial arts studios to check if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Note the specific days and times of the classes.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Start with Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, then move on to the others if necessary.\n\n2. **Summarize the Findings:**\n   - **Assistant:** Compile the information into a clear and concise summary, including the names, addresses, and class schedules of the martial arts studios that meet the criteria.\n\n3. **Optional: Validate Walking Distances:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use Google Maps to validate the walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\nLet's proceed with verifying the class schedules for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street first.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n1. **Ineffective Download of Full Schedule:**\n   - Despite clicking the \"DOWNLOAD FULL SCHEDULE\" button, the full schedule was not downloaded or displayed, and the page remained unchanged.\n2. **Lack of Direct Access to Class Times:**\n   - The class times were not directly visible on the main page or easily accessible through the search results.\n3. **Repetitive Actions:**\n   - Repeatedly clicking the same button without a different approach or additional steps to ensure the schedule was accessed.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Directly Navigate to the Schedule Section:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website and click on the \"Schedule\" link in the navigation menu to directly access the class schedule.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Scroll through the schedule to find classes between 7-9 pm on weekdays.\n\n2. **Search for Specific Class Times:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule 7-9 pm weekdays\" and open the relevant search results.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Check the search results for any direct links to the class schedule or detailed information about evening classes.\n\n3. **Check Other Studios:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** If the schedule for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is not found, visit the websites or social media pages of the other identified martial arts studios (Modern Martial Arts Tribeca, Martial Arts Family Studio, Anderson's Martial Arts Academy, and Workshop NYC Muay Thai & Jiujitsu).\n   - **WebSurfer:** Look for the \"Schedule\" or \"Classes\" sections on these websites to find classes between 7-9 pm on weekdays.\n\n4. **Summarize the Findings:**\n   - **Assistant:** Compile the information into a clear and concise summary, including the names, addresses, and class schedules of the martial arts studios that meet the criteria.\n\n5. **Optional: Validate Walking Distances:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use Google Maps to validate the walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\n### Steps to Execute the New Plan:\n- **Step 1:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Click on the \"Schedule\" link in the navigation menu.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Scroll through the schedule to find classes between 7-9 pm on weekdays.\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule 7-9 pm weekdays\".\n  - **WebSurfer:** Open the relevant search results and check for class times.\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** If the schedule is not found, visit the websites of Modern Martial Arts Tribeca, Martial Arts Family Studio, Anderson's Martial Arts Academy, and Workshop NYC Muay Thai & Jiujitsu.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Look for the \"Schedule\" or \"Classes\" sections on these websites.\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - **Assistant:** Compile the findings into a summary.\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Use Google Maps to validate walking distances if necessary."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and progress we've made:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time for classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n   - The exact address of the New York Stock Exchange is 11 Wall St, New York City, NY 10005.\n   - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is located at 22 New St, New York, NY 10005, and is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The operating hours for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street are Monday to Friday: 5:45 AM to 9 PM, and Saturday and Sunday: 9:30 AM to 2 PM.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The class schedules for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street to confirm if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - A list of other martial arts studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The class schedules of these other martial arts studios to confirm if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n     - Google Maps or a similar mapping service to find martial arts studios within the specified radius.\n     - The websites or social media pages of the identified martial arts studios for their class schedules.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The actual walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified martial arts studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n   - The availability of evening classes (7-9 pm) at the identified studios, which may require checking multiple days to ensure consistent scheduling.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely several fitness and martial arts studios in the Financial District area due to the high concentration of office workers.\n   - Popular martial arts styles like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, and Krav Maga might be available, as they are common in urban areas.\n   - Studios in the area may cater to professionals, offering flexible evening hours to accommodate after-work training.\n   - Based on the initial search, some potential martial arts studios within the vicinity include:\n     - **Academy of Integrated Martial Systems** (30 Broad St Floor 6, New York)\n     - **Systema New York City** (South St SE, New York)\n     - **Modern Martial Arts Tribeca** (78 Reade St)\n     - **Martial Arts Family Studio** (290 Mulberry St)\n     - **Anderson's Martial Arts Academy** (12 E 14th St)\n     - **Workshop NYC Muay Thai & Jiujitsu** (92 Delancey St)\n   - These studios are likely to have evening classes, but we need to verify the specific times.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n1. **Verify Class Schedules:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Visit the websites or social media pages of the identified martial arts studios to check if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Note the specific days and times of the classes.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Start with Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street, then move on to the others if necessary.\n\n2. **Summarize the Findings:**\n   - **Assistant:** Compile the information into a clear and concise summary, including the names, addresses, and class schedules of the martial arts studios that meet the criteria.\n\n3. **Optional: Validate Walking Distances:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use Google Maps to validate the walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Step 1:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Visit the website of Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street and check the class schedule for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n  - **WebSurfer:** If the schedule is not found, perform a web search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule 7-9 pm weekdays\" and open the relevant search results.\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Visit the websites of Academy of Integrated Martial Systems and Systema New York City to check their class schedules for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Note the specific days and times of the classes.\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - **Assistant:** Compile the findings into a summary.\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Use Google Maps to validate the walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\nLet's start by visiting the website of Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street and checking the class schedule for evening classes between 7-9 pm. If the schedule is not found, we will perform a web search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule 7-9 pm weekdays\" and open the relevant search results.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n1. **Ineffective Navigation to Class Schedule:**\n   - Despite clicking the \"DOWNLOAD FULL SCHEDULE\" button on the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website, the full schedule was not displayed or downloaded.\n   - The class schedule was not directly visible on the main page or easily accessible through the search results.\n\n2. **Lack of Direct Access to Class Times:**\n   - The class times were not directly visible on the main page or easily accessible through the search results.\n   - The search results did not provide a clear link to the class schedule.\n\n3. **Repetitive Actions:**\n   - Repeatedly clicking the same button without a different approach or additional steps to ensure the schedule was accessed.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Directly Navigate to the Schedule Section:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Click on the \"Schedule\" link in the navigation menu to directly access the class schedule.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Scroll through the schedule to find classes between 7-9 pm on weekdays.\n\n2. **Perform a Web Search for Specific Class Times:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule 7-9 pm weekdays\" and open the relevant search results.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Check the search results for any direct links to the class schedule or detailed information about evening classes.\n\n3. **Check Other Identified Studios:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Visit the websites of Academy of Integrated Martial Systems and Systema New York City.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Look for the \"Schedule\" or \"Classes\" sections on these websites to find classes between 7-9 pm on weekdays.\n\n4. **Summarize the Findings:**\n   - **Assistant:** Compile the information into a clear and concise summary, including the names, addresses, and class schedules of the martial arts studios that meet the criteria.\n\n5. **Optional: Validate Walking Distances:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use Google Maps to validate the walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\n### Steps to Execute the New Plan:\n- **Step 1:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Click on the \"Schedule\" link in the navigation menu.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Scroll through the schedule to find classes between 7-9 pm on weekdays.\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule 7-9 pm weekdays\".\n  - **WebSurfer:** Open the relevant search results and check for class times.\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Visit the website of Academy of Integrated Martial Systems.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Look for the \"Schedule\" or \"Classes\" sections on the website.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Check for classes between 7-9 pm on weekdays.\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Visit the website of Systema New York City.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Look for the \"Schedule\" or \"Classes\" sections on the website.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Check for classes between 7-9 pm on weekdays.\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - **Assistant:** Compile the findings into a summary.\n\n- **Step 6:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Use Google Maps to validate the walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\nLet's start with Step 1: Navigate to the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website and click on the \"Schedule\" link in the navigation menu."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and progress we've made:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The time for classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n   - The exact address of the New York Stock Exchange is 11 Wall St, New York City, NY 10005.\n   - Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street is located at 22 New St, New York, NY 10005, and is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The operating hours for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street are Monday to Friday: 5:45 AM to 9 PM, and Saturday and Sunday: 9:30 AM to 2 PM.\n   - The website for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street does not provide a downloadable or easily accessible full class schedule.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The class schedules for Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street to confirm if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - A list of other martial arts studios within a five-minute walking distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n   - The class schedules of these other martial arts studios to confirm if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n     - Google Maps or a similar mapping service to find martial arts studios within the specified radius.\n     - The websites or social media pages of the identified martial arts studios for their class schedules.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The actual walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified martial arts studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n   - The availability of evening classes (7-9 pm) at the identified studios, which may require checking multiple days to ensure consistent scheduling.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - There are likely several fitness and martial arts studios in the Financial District area due to the high concentration of office workers.\n   - Popular martial arts styles like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, and Krav Maga might be available, as they are common in urban areas.\n   - Studios in the area may cater to professionals, offering flexible evening hours to accommodate after-work training.\n   - Based on the initial search, some potential martial arts studios within the vicinity include:\n     - **Academy of Integrated Martial Systems** (30 Broad St Floor 6, New York)\n     - **Systema New York City** (South St SE, New York)\n     - **Modern Martial Arts Tribeca** (78 Reade St)\n     - **Martial Arts Family Studio** (290 Mulberry St)\n     - **Anderson's Martial Arts Academy** (12 E 14th St)\n     - **Workshop NYC Muay Thai & Jiujitsu** (92 Delancey St)\n   - These studios are likely to have evening classes, but we need to verify the specific times.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n1. **Verify Class Schedules:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule 7-9 pm weekdays\" and open the relevant search results to find the class times.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Visit the websites or social media pages of the identified martial arts studios to check if they offer classes between 7-9 pm.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Note the specific days and times of the classes.\n\n2. **Summarize the Findings:**\n   - **Assistant:** Compile the information into a clear and concise summary, including the names, addresses, and class schedules of the martial arts studios that meet the criteria.\n\n3. **Optional: Validate Walking Distances:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use Google Maps to validate the walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Step 1:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule 7-9 pm weekdays\" and open the relevant search results to find the class times.\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Visit the websites of Academy of Integrated Martial Systems and Systema New York City to check their class schedules for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Note the specific days and times of the classes.\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - **Assistant:** Compile the findings into a summary.\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Use Google Maps to validate the walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\nLet's start with Step 1: Perform a web search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule 7-9 pm weekdays\" and open the relevant search results to find the class times.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n1. **Ineffective Navigation to Class Schedule:**\n   - Despite clicking the \"DOWNLOAD FULL SCHEDULE\" button on the Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street website, the full schedule was not displayed or downloaded.\n   - The class schedule was not directly visible on the main page or easily accessible through the search results.\n\n2. **Lack of Direct Access to Class Times:**\n   - The class times were not directly visible on the main page or easily accessible through the search results.\n   - The search results did not provide a clear link to the class schedule.\n\n3. **Repetitive Actions:**\n   - Repeatedly clicking the same button without a different approach or additional steps to ensure the schedule was accessed.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Perform a More Targeted Web Search:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule PDF\" to find a downloadable version of the schedule.\n   - **WebSurfer:** If a PDF is found, download it and open it to find the class times for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n\n2. **Check Social Media and Reviews:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Visit the social media pages (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) of Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Look for posts or comments that mention evening class schedules.\n\n3. **Visit Other Identified Studios:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Visit the websites of Academy of Integrated Martial Systems and Systema New York City.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Look for the \"Schedule\" or \"Classes\" sections on these websites to find classes between 7-9 pm on weekdays.\n\n4. **Summarize the Findings:**\n   - **Assistant:** Compile the information into a clear and concise summary, including the names, addresses, and class schedules of the martial arts studios that meet the criteria.\n\n5. **Validate Walking Distances:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use Google Maps to validate the walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\n### Steps to Execute the New Plan:\n- **Step 1:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule PDF\".\n  - **WebSurfer:** If a PDF is found, download it and open it to find the class times for evening classes between 7-9 pm.\n\n- **Step 2:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Visit the social media pages (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) of Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Look for posts or comments that mention evening class schedules.\n\n- **Step 3:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Visit the website of Academy of Integrated Martial Systems.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Look for the \"Schedule\" or \"Classes\" sections on the website.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Check for classes between 7-9 pm on weekdays.\n\n- **Step 4:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Visit the website of Systema New York City.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Look for the \"Schedule\" or \"Classes\" sections on the website.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Check for classes between 7-9 pm on weekdays.\n\n- **Step 5:**\n  - **Assistant:** Compile the findings into a summary.\n\n- **Step 6:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Use Google Maps to validate the walking routes and distances from the New York Stock Exchange to the identified studios to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n\nLet's start with Step 1: Perform a web search for \"Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Wall Street class schedule PDF\" and open the relevant search results to find the class times."}
