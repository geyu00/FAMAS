Since I do not have access to execute a valid search with the API key directly, let’s take a different approach to find the year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n\nAs the AlligatorBiology_Expert, I can leverage existing knowledge and historical data regarding the distribution of the American Alligator. Based on my knowledge, the American Alligator was first recorded in New Mexico in the year 1970, which would be the first sighting west of Texas.\n\nTo verify this information:\n\n1. I will cross-reference the year 1970 with credible sources, particularly focusing on USGS documentation or similar reputable ecological studies.\n2.

{"agent": "DataVerification_Expert", "content": "To verify the claim made by the AlligatorBiology_Expert regarding the American Alligator's first sighting west of Texas (specifically in New Mexico in 1970), I will need to conduct a search for supporting documentation or records from USGS or other reputable sources.\n\nGiven the previous error in executing the API request, I will attempt a different approach without using the Bing API, by conducting a manual search. I will utilize specific queries to find verifiable evidence on the matter.\n\nHere is the new search plan:\n1. Use a straightforward query to look for USGS documents or other credible sources regarding the first sighting of the American Alligator in New Mexico.\n2. Check for any potential discrepancies in the date or information provided.\n\nLet me search for this information now. \n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Define the parameters for the search query\nsearch_terms = \"American Alligator first sighting west of Texas site:usgs.gov\"\nresponse = requests.get(f\"https://www.google.com/search?q={search_terms}\")\n\n# This approach won't run directly since I cannot execute HTTP requests without a valid API key.\n# I will just gather URLs or references for later verification manually.\n\nprint(search_terms)\n```\n\nThe output will include the search terms I used.
