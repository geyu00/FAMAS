Hreidmar is a character from Norse mythology, and one of his sons is Fafnir, who is famously known for his transformation into a dragon.\n\n1. **Confirming the journal name \"Fafnir\":**\n   - Hreidmar's son, Fafnir, indeed fits the criteria given his role in the Norse myths surrounding dragons. As such, the name of the journal \"Fafnir\" is confirmed.\n\n2. **Next step: Locating Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in \"Fafnir\":**\n   - Now that the journal name is verified, I will search for the specific article by Emily Midkiff in June 2014 to analyze it.\n\n3. **Analyzing the article:**\n   - According to the previous results, the word quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions is \"clichéd.\"\n\nThus, the findings align with the criteria set forth.
