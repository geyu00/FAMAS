However, the script is currently returning an error. We need to debug the script and correct it.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Review the provided Python script to identify any syntax or logical errors.\n2. Correct the identified errors in the script.\n3. Test the corrected script with a sample input to ensure it works as expected.\n\n## Output format\n- The corrected Python script\n- The output of the script when tested with a sample input\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The script should correctly process the list of numbers and return the sum of the squares of the even numbers.\n- The script should handle edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with no even numbers.\n\n## Provided Python script\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\nresult = sum_of_squares_even(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```"}

It defines a function `sum_of_squares_even` that correctly calculates the sum of the squares of even numbers from the given list. \n\n### Testing the Script\nWe will test the script with the provided list of numbers to ensure it functions correctly. Here's the output we expect for the provided sample input.\n\n### Corrected Python Script\nEven though the provided script looks correct, I will re-confirm and execute it to ensure it works as expected.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\ndef sum_of_squares_even(numbers):\n    sum_squares = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            sum_squares += num ** 2\n    return sum_squares\n\nresult = sum_of_squares_even(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nI will now execute this script."}
