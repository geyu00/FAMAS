{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking about the year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source for this information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n   - This information can be found on the USGS website or in their publications related to wildlife and geographic distribution.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No derivations are necessary based on the given request.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The American Alligator is primarily found in the southeastern United States, so it is likely that the first discovery west of Texas occurred relatively recently, possibly in the late 20th century or early 21st century.\n   - Potential states where the alligator might have been discovered could include New Mexico, Arizona, or California, given their proximity to Texas and suitable habitats.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search the USGS website for information on the first discovery of the American Alligator west of Texas.\n- **Step 2:** If the information is not directly available, use WebSurfer to search additional authoritative sources such as scientific journals or wildlife reports.\n- **Step 3:** Once the relevant information is found, verify the year and any other pertinent details.\n- **Step 4:** Summarize the findings and provide the requested year."}

American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998).Disclaimer:\nThe Nonindigenous Occurrences section of the NAS species profiles has a new structure. The section is now dynamically updated from the NAS database to ensure that it contains the most current and accurate information. Occurrences are summarized in Table 1, alphabetically by state, with years of earliest and most recent observations, and the tally and names of drainages where the species was observed. The table contains hyperlinks to collections tables of specimens based on the states, years, and drainages selected. References to specimens that were not obtained through sighting reports and personal communications are found through the hyperlink in the Table 1 caption or through the individual specimens linked in the collections tables.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"og:site_name\": \"USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221\",\n        \"og:title\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://nas.er.usgs.gov/XIMAGESERVERX/2019/20190613131315.JPG\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Species summary for American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis)\",\n        \"Description\": \"American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

It is occasionally found in brackish water (Mount, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998). The species is often associated with cypress swamps and mangrove swamps (Mount, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998). The alligator is primarily active during the warmer months of the year, and is known to hibernate during colder months (Mount, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998). A. mississippiensis is a powerful swimmer and can travel long distances in water (Mount, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998). It is also capable of moving on land, although it is less agile on land than in water (Mount, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998). The species is known to construct dens or burrows for shelter and hibernation (Mount, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>\n\nFrom the Nonindigenous Occurrences section, I found that the first entry indicating the American Alligator was found in a state west of Texas is:\n\n- **New Mexico (NM)**: First Observed in **1972** at Elephant Butte Reservoir.\n\nTherefore, the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas) in the year **1972**."}
