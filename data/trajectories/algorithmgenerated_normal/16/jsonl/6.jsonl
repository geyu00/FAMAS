{"agent": "Video_Analyst_Expert", "content": "To start off, I will utilize the YouTube Data API to search for the specific 360 VR video from March 2018 narrated by the voice actor who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings series. Let's identify this video first.\n\nI will construct a query to find videos that match the criteria (specifically looking for videos from March 2018 and featuring Gollum's voice actor, Andy Serkis). Here’s the code I will use:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# YouTube API key (replace with your key)\nAPI_KEY = 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY'\n\n# Define the search parameters\nsearch_url = \"https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search\"\nquery = \"Gollum 360 VR\"\npublished_after = \"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z\"\npublished_before = \"2018-03-31T23:59:59Z\"\n\nparams = {\n    'part': 'snippet',\n    'q': query,\n    'type': 'video',\n    'publishedAfter': published_after,\n    'publishedBefore': published_before,\n    'key': API_KEY\n}\n\nresponse = requests.get(search_url, params=params)\nvideos = response.json()\n\n# Print the video IDs and titles for verification\nfor item in videos['items']:\n    print(f\"Title: {item['snippet']['title']}, Video ID: {item['id']['videoId']}\")\n```\n\nNext, I will have the Computer_terminal execute this code to retrieve the list of videos that fit these criteria. Once I receive the result, I will analyze the output to find the correct video."}
