{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the first year the Apple stock (AAPL) went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The source to verify this information is Google Finance.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance.\n   - Specific date or year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact year when the stock price first exceeded $50, based on the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone multiple splits, so the $50 threshold in its early history would likely correspond to a much higher price in today's adjusted terms.\n   - Given the company's growth trajectory, it is reasonable to guess that this event occurred sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s, but this needs verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to Google Finance and search for the historical stock price data of Apple (AAPL).\n- **Data Collection**: Have WebSurfer locate the specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n- **Verification**: Ensure that the data is accurate and corresponds to the correct time period.\n- **Report**: Summarize the findings and provide the exact year when the stock price first exceeded $50."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the first year the Apple stock (AAPL) went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The source to verify this information is Google Finance.\n   - We have navigated to the historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance and set the view to the maximum time range (MAX).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The historical stock price chart or table on Google Finance should show the exact date or year when the stock price first reached this milestone.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact year when the stock price first exceeded $50, based on the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone multiple splits, so the $50 threshold in its early history would likely correspond to a much higher price in today's adjusted terms.\n   - Given the company's growth trajectory and the historical context, it is reasonable to guess that this event occurred sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s. However, the exact year needs to be verified from the historical data.\n   - Based on the historical chart, it appears that the stock price was relatively low in the early years of the company, which aligns with the hypothesis that the $50 threshold was likely reached in the late 1980s or early 1990s.\n\n**Additional Hunch:**\n- Since the stock price chart shows significant growth over the years, it is likely that the $50 threshold was reached during a period of rapid growth for Apple. This period could be around the time when the Macintosh was introduced in 1984 or shortly thereafter, as this product marked a significant milestone in Apple's history and could have driven the stock price upward.\n\nPlease continue to scroll through the historical stock price data to find the specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Navigation and Data Location:** The WebSurfer was not able to navigate to the specific section of the historical stock prices chart or table on Google Finance. The repeated attempts to scroll down did not lead to the desired data, possibly because the relevant data was not within the visible viewport or required additional interaction to load.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions:** The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were too general and did not specify the exact steps needed to locate the historical stock price data, such as interacting with the chart or table controls.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Navigate to Historical Prices Section:**\n  - **Step 1:** Navigate to the Apple Inc. (AAPL) page on Google Finance.\n  - **Step 2:** Click on the \"Historical Prices\" or \"Historical Data\" section if available. If not, click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum time range.\n  - **Step 3:** Scroll down to the historical stock prices chart or table.\n  - **Step 4:** Identify the specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n- **Ensure Data Loading:**\n  - **Step 5:** If the data does not load immediately, wait for a few seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded. Use the `sleep` function if necessary.\n\n- **Verify Data:**\n  - **Step 6:** Verify the data by checking the historical prices chart or table for the year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n  - **Step 7:** Provide the exact year found.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Navigate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) Page:**\n   - Open Google Finance and search for \"Apple Inc\" (AAPL).\n   - Click on the search result to go to the Apple Inc. page.\n\n2. **Click on Historical Prices Section:**\n   - Look for a section labeled \"Historical Prices\" or \"Historical Data.\"\n   - If the section is not immediately visible, click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum time range.\n\n3. **Scroll to Historical Data:**\n   - Scroll down to the historical stock prices chart or table.\n   - If the chart or table is interactive, use the controls to navigate to the earliest part of the data.\n\n4. **Wait for Data to Load:**\n   - If the data takes time to load, use the `sleep` function to wait for a few seconds (e.g., 5 seconds).\n\n5. **Identify the Year:**\n   - Carefully examine the historical data to find the first year when the stock price exceeded $50.\n   - Note the exact year.\n\n6. **Report the Year:**\n   - Summarize the findings and provide the exact year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n### Example Commands:\n```python\n# Step 1: Navigate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) Page\nawait web_surfer.navigate(\"https://www.google.com/finance\")\nawait web_surfer.type_into_search_bar(\"Apple Inc\")\nawait web_surfer.click_search_button()\n\n# Step 2: Click on Historical Prices Section\nawait web_surfer.click_element_with_text(\"Historical Prices\")\n\n# Step 3: Scroll to Historical Data\nawait web_surfer.scroll_down(1)\n\n# Step 4: Wait for Data to Load\nawait web_surfer.sleep(5)\n\n# Step 5: Identify the Year\nyear = await web_surfer.find_text_in_page(\"First year stock price exceeded $50\")\nprint(f\"The first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split) was {year}.\")\n```\n\nBy following these detailed steps, we should be able to accurately identify the year when Apple's stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the first year the Apple stock (AAPL) went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The source to verify this information is Google Finance.\n   - We have navigated to the historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance and set the view to the maximum time range (MAX).\n   - The historical stock price chart on Google Finance shows data from the early 1980s to the present.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The historical stock price chart or table on Google Finance should show the exact date or year when the stock price first reached this milestone.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact year when the stock price first exceeded $50, based on the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone multiple splits, so the $50 threshold in its early history would likely correspond to a much higher price in today's adjusted terms.\n   - Given the company's growth trajectory and the historical context, it is reasonable to guess that this event occurred sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s. However, the exact year needs to be verified from the historical data.\n   - Based on the historical chart, it appears that the stock price was relatively low in the early years of the company, which aligns with the hypothesis that the $50 threshold was likely reached in the late 1980s or early 1990s.\n   - **New Hunch:** The introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 and the subsequent growth in the mid-1980s could have been a significant factor in the stock price reaching $50. Therefore, it is plausible that the stock price first exceeded $50 in the mid-1980s, specifically around 1985 or 1986.\n\n**Additional Hunch:**\n- Since the stock price chart shows significant growth over the years, it is likely that the $50 threshold was reached during a period of rapid growth for Apple. This period could be around the time when the Macintosh was introduced in 1984 or shortly thereafter, as this product marked a significant milestone in Apple's history and could have driven the stock price upward.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Continue to scroll through the historical stock price data to find the specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n- Focus on the mid-1980s, particularly around 1985 or 1986, as this period is a strong candidate based on the company's historical milestones.\n\nPlease proceed to scroll through the historical stock price data to find the specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Navigation and Data Location:** The WebSurfer was not able to navigate to the specific section of the historical stock prices chart or table on Google Finance. The repeated attempts to scroll down did not lead to the desired data, possibly because the relevant data was not within the visible viewport or required additional interaction to load.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions:** The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were too general and did not specify the exact steps needed to locate the historical stock price data, such as interacting with the chart or table controls.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Navigate to Historical Prices Section:**\n  - **Step 1:** Navigate to the Apple Inc. (AAPL) page on Google Finance.\n  - **Step 2:** Click on the \"Historical Prices\" or \"Historical Data\" section if available. If not, click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum time range.\n  - **Step 3:** Scroll down to the historical stock prices chart or table.\n  - **Step 4:** Identify the specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n- **Ensure Data Loading:**\n  - **Step 5:** If the data does not load immediately, wait for a few seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded. Use the `sleep` function if necessary.\n\n- **Verify Data:**\n  - **Step 6:** Verify the data by checking the historical prices chart or table for the year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n  - **Step 7:** Provide the exact year found.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Navigate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) Page:**\n   - Open Google Finance and search for \"Apple Inc\" (AAPL).\n   - Click on the search result to go to the Apple Inc. page.\n\n2. **Click on Historical Prices Section:**\n   - Look for a section labeled \"Historical Prices\" or \"Historical Data.\"\n   - If the section is not immediately visible, click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum time range.\n\n3. **Scroll to Historical Data:**\n   - Scroll down to the historical stock prices chart or table.\n   - If the chart or table is interactive, use the controls to navigate to the earliest part of the data.\n\n4. **Wait for Data to Load:**\n   - If the data takes time to load, use the `sleep` function to wait for a few seconds (e.g., 5 seconds).\n\n5. **Identify the Year:**\n   - Carefully examine the historical data to find the first year when the stock price exceeded $50.\n   - Note the exact year.\n\n6. **Report the Year:**\n   - Summarize the findings and provide the exact year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n### Example Commands:\n```python\n# Step 1: Navigate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) Page\nawait web_surfer.navigate(\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ\")\n\n# Step 2: Click on Historical Prices Section\nawait web_surfer.click_element_with_text(\"Historical Prices\")\n\n# Step 3: Scroll to Historical Data\nawait web_surfer.scroll_down(1)\n\n# Step 4: Wait for Data to Load\nawait web_surfer.sleep(5)\n\n# Step 5: Identify the Year\nyear = await web_surfer.find_text_in_page(\"First year stock price exceeded $50\")\nprint(f\"The first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split) was {year}.\")\n```\n\n### Additional Hints:\n- **Specific Element Interaction:** Ensure that the WebSurfer clicks on the exact element that opens the historical prices section. This might require more precise targeting, such as using CSS selectors or XPath.\n- **Scroll and Wait:** After each scroll, wait a few seconds to allow the data to load completely.\n- **Check for Interactive Controls:** If the historical data is presented in an interactive chart or table, use the controls to navigate to the earliest data points.\n\nBy following these detailed steps and hints, we should be able to accurately identify the year when Apple's stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the first year the Apple stock (AAPL) went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The source to verify this information is Google Finance.\n   - We have navigated to the historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance and set the view to the maximum time range (MAX).\n   - The historical stock price chart on Google Finance shows data from the early 1980s to the present.\n   - The current stock price of Apple (as of the last update) is $211.16.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The historical stock price chart or table on Google Finance should show the exact date or year when the stock price first reached this milestone.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact year when the stock price first exceeded $50, based on the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone multiple splits, so the $50 threshold in its early history would likely correspond to a much higher price in today's adjusted terms.\n   - Given the company's growth trajectory and the historical context, it is reasonable to guess that this event occurred sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s. However, the exact year needs to be verified from the historical data.\n   - **Updated Hunch:** The introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 and the subsequent growth in the mid-1980s could have been a significant factor in the stock price reaching $50. Therefore, it is plausible that the stock price first exceeded $50 in the mid-1980s, specifically around 1985 or 1986.\n   - **New Hunch:** Given the historical context and the significant impact of the Macintosh, it is also possible that the stock price first exceeded $50 in 1987, as the effects of the Macintosh launch and subsequent sales might have taken some time to reflect in the stock price.\n\n**Additional Hunch:**\n- Since the stock price chart shows significant growth over the years, it is likely that the $50 threshold was reached during a period of rapid growth for Apple. This period could be around the time when the Macintosh was introduced in 1984 or shortly thereafter, as this product marked a significant milestone in Apple's history and could have driven the stock price upward.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Continue to scroll through the historical stock price data to find the specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n- Focus on the mid-1980s, particularly around 1985, 1986, or 1987, as this period is a strong candidate based on the company's historical milestones.\n\n### Detailed Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) Page:**\n   - Open Google Finance and search for \"Apple Inc\" (AAPL).\n   - Click on the search result to go to the Apple Inc. page.\n\n2. **Click on Historical Prices Section:**\n   - Look for a section labeled \"Historical Prices\" or \"Historical Data.\"\n   - If the section is not immediately visible, click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum time range.\n\n3. **Scroll to Historical Data:**\n   - Scroll down to the historical stock prices chart or table.\n   - If the chart or table is interactive, use the controls to navigate to the earliest part of the data.\n\n4. **Wait for Data to Load:**\n   - If the data takes time to load, use the `sleep` function to wait for a few seconds (e.g., 5 seconds).\n\n5. **Identify the Year:**\n   - Carefully examine the historical data to find the first year when the stock price exceeded $50.\n   - Note the exact year.\n\n6. **Report the Year:**\n   - Summarize the findings and provide the exact year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n### Example Commands\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Navigate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) Page\nawait web_surfer.navigate(\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ\")\n\n# Step 2: Click on Historical Prices Section\nawait web_surfer.click_element_with_text(\"Historical Prices\")\n\n# Step 3: Scroll to Historical Data\nawait web_surfer.scroll_down(1)\n\n# Step 4: Wait for Data to Load\nawait web_surfer.sleep(5)\n\n# Step 5: Identify the Year\nyear = await web_surfer.find_text_in_page(\"First year stock price exceeded $50\")\nprint(f\"The first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split) was {year}.\")\n```\n\n### Additional Hints\n- **Specific Element Interaction:** Ensure that the WebSurfer clicks on the exact element that opens the historical prices section. This might require more precise targeting, such as using CSS selectors or XPath.\n- **Scroll and Wait:** After each scroll, wait a few seconds to allow the data to load completely.\n- **Check for Interactive Controls:** If the historical data is presented in an interactive chart or table, use the controls to navigate to the earliest data points.\n\nBy following these detailed steps and hints, we should be able to accurately identify the year when Apple's stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Navigation and Data Location:** The WebSurfer was repeatedly clicking the 'MAX' button but not navigating to the 'Historical Prices' or 'Historical Data' section. This suggests that the 'MAX' button alone does not provide access to the detailed historical data needed.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions:** The instructions provided were too general and did not specify the exact steps needed to locate the historical stock price data, such as interacting with the chart or table controls.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Navigate to Historical Prices Section:**\n  - **Step 1:** Navigate to the Apple Inc. (AAPL) page on Google Finance.\n  - **Step 2:** Click on the \"Historical Prices\" or \"Historical Data\" section if available.

Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the first year the Apple stock (AAPL) went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The source to verify this information is Google Finance.\n   - We have navigated to the historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) on Google Finance and set the view to the maximum time range (MAX).\n   - The historical stock price chart on Google Finance shows data from the early 1980s to the present.\n   - The current stock price of Apple (as of the last update) is $211.16.\n   - The historical data chart shows significant growth over the years, with the stock price reaching various milestones.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year when the stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - The historical stock price chart or table on Google Finance should show the exact date or year when the stock price first reached this milestone.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact year when the stock price first exceeded $50, based on the historical data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Apple's stock has undergone multiple splits, so the $50 threshold in its early history would likely correspond to a much higher price in today's adjusted terms.\n   - Given the company's growth trajectory and the historical context, it is reasonable to guess that this event occurred sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s. However, the exact year needs to be verified from the historical data.\n   - **Updated Hunch:** The introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 and the subsequent growth in the mid-1980s could have been a significant factor in the stock price reaching $50. Therefore, it is plausible that the stock price first exceeded $50 in the mid-1980s, specifically around 1985 or 1986.\n   - **New Hunch:** Given the historical context and the significant impact of the Macintosh, it is also possible that the stock price first exceeded $50 in 1987, as the effects of the Macintosh launch and subsequent sales might have taken some time to reflect in the stock price.\n   - **Additional Hunch:** The stock price might have reached $50 in 1988, considering the continued growth and positive market reception of Apple products during this period.\n\n### Detailed Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) Page:**\n   - Open Google Finance and search for \"Apple Inc\" (AAPL).\n   - Click on the search result to go to the Apple Inc. page.\n\n2. **Click on Historical Prices Section:**\n   - Look for a section labeled \"Historical Prices\" or \"Historical Data.\"\n   - If the section is not immediately visible, click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum time range.\n\n3. **Scroll to Historical Data:**\n   - Scroll down to the historical stock prices chart or table.\n   - If the chart or table is interactive, use the controls to navigate to the earliest part of the data.\n\n4. **Wait for Data to Load:**\n   - If the data takes time to load, use the `sleep` function to wait for a few seconds (e.g., 5 seconds).\n\n5. **Identify the Year:**\n   - Carefully examine the historical data to find the first year when the stock price exceeded $50.\n   - Note the exact year.\n\n6. **Report the Year:**\n   - Summarize the findings and provide the exact year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n### Example Commands\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Navigate to Apple Inc.

This might require more precise targeting, such as using CSS selectors or XPath.\n- **Scroll and Wait:** After each scroll, wait a few seconds to allow the data to load completely.\n- **Check for Interactive Controls:** If the historical data is presented in an interactive chart or table, use the controls to navigate to the earliest data points.\n\nBy following these detailed steps and hints, we should be able to accurately identify the year when Apple's stock price first exceeded $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Locate the Historical Prices Section:** Ensure that the 'Historical Prices' or 'Historical Data' section is clicked to access the detailed historical stock prices.\n- **Examine the Data:** Focus on the mid-1980s, particularly around 1985, 1986, 1987, or 1988, to identify the first year the stock price exceeded $50.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step to locate the 'Historical Prices' section and examine the data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Incorrect Targeting of Elements:** The WebSurfer was not correctly identifying and clicking on the 'Historical Prices' or 'Historical Data' section. Instead, it was clicking on other elements like 'Search for stocks, ETFs & more to compare with,' which did not lead to the desired data.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions:** The instructions provided were too general and did not specify the exact steps needed to locate the historical stock price data, such as using more precise targeting methods like CSS selectors or XPath.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Navigate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) Page:**\n   - Open Google Finance and search for \"Apple Inc\" (AAPL).\n   - Click on the search result to go to the Apple Inc. page.\n\n2. **Click on Historical Prices Section:**\n   - Use a more precise method to click on the 'Historical Prices' or 'Historical Data' section. This might involve using CSS selectors or XPath to target the exact element.\n   - If the section is not immediately visible, click on the \"MAX\" button to view the maximum time range.\n\n3. **Scroll to Historical Data:**\n   - Scroll down to the historical stock prices chart or table.\n   - If the chart or table is interactive, use the controls to navigate to the earliest part of the data.\n\n4. **Wait for Data to Load:**\n   - If the data takes time to load, use the `sleep` function to wait for a few seconds (e.g., 5 seconds).\n\n5. **Identify the Year:**\n   - Carefully examine the historical data to find the first year when the stock price exceeded $50.\n   - Note the exact year.\n\n6. **Report the Year:**\n   - Summarize the findings and provide the exact year when the stock price first exceeded $50.\n\n### Example Commands:\n```python\n# Step 1: Navigate to Apple Inc.

It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no,minimal-ui\",\n        \"google-site-verification\": \"sxp7zFOFUzk09RdlFhuH2SoCn5nOkXgomiLeLIQ48p0\",\n        \"mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\": \"yes\",\n        \"application-name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-title\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\": \"default\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"msapplication-tap-highlight\": \"no\",\n        \"description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_770x402.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"770\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"402\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary\",\n        \"twitter:site\": \"@google\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"Apple Inc (AAPL) Stock Price & News - Google Finance\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"Get the latest Apple Inc (AAPL) real-time quote, historical performance, charts, and other financial information to help you make more informed trading and investment decisions.\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://ssl.gstatic.com/finance/favicon/finance_496x496.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
