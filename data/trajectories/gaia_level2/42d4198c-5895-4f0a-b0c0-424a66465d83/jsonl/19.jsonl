The game was released worldwide for the \nPlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a \nWindows port released in January 2022. It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are basically 2 protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and \ngods of the Norse world. \nDescribed by creative director \nCory Barlog as a reimagining of the franchise, a major \ngameplay change is that Kratos makes prominent use of a magical \nbattle axe known as the Leviathan Axe instead of his signature \ndouble-chained blades called the Blades of Chaos. The game also uses an \nover-the-shoulder free camera, with the game in \none shot, as opposed to the \nfixed cinematic camera of the previous entries. It also includes \nrole-playing game elements, and Kratos's son Atreus provides assistance in combat. The majority of the original game's development team worked on \nGod of War and designed it to be accessible and grounded. A separate short \ntext-based game, \nA Call from the Wilds, was released in February 2018 through \nFacebook Messenger and follows Atreus on his first adventure.

Three days before \nGod of War's release, a smartphone companion app called \nMímir's Vision was made available, providing additional information about the game's Norse setting. \nGod of War received universal acclaim from critics for its story, world design, art direction, music, graphics, combat system, and characters, in particular the dynamic between Kratos and Atreus. Many reviewers felt it had successfully revitalized the series without losing the core identity of its predecessors. It was named \nGame of the Year by numerous media outlets and award shows, and has been cited as among the \ngreatest video games ever made. The game also performed well commercially, selling over 5 million units within a month of its release and 23 million units sold by November 2022, making it one of the \nbest-selling PlayStation 4 games and the best-selling game in the series. A \nnovelization was released in August 2018, followed by \na prequel comic series published from November 2018 to June 2021, while a \nlive-action television series is in development for \nAmazon Prime Video. A sequel, \nGod of War Ragnarök, was released for the PlayStation 4 and \nPlayStation 5 in November 2022, and for Windows in 2024. \nGameplay[edit]God of War is a \nthird-person \naction-adventure video game. It features an \nover-the-shoulder free camera (a departure from the previous installments which featured a \nfixed cinematic camera, with the exception of 2007's \ntwo-dimensional \nside-scrollerBetrayal).\n[7] Cinematographically, the game is presented in a \ncontinuous shot, with no \ncamera cuts or \nloading screens.\n[8] Although the previous main installment, \nAscension (2013), introduced \nmultiplayer to the series, this installment is \nsingle-player-only.\n[4] Regarding the level structure, creative director \nCory Barlog said \"it's open, but it is not an \nopen world.\"\n[9] Due to its openness, a \nfast travel feature is unlocked later in the game.\n[10] Swimming, an ability in previous games, was cut;\n[11] players instead use a boat to traverse bodies of water.\n[10] Unlike previous games, which allowed players to jump freely at any time, jumping can now only be done at designated areas, such as at a rock face or ledge. Throughout the game, players battle \nNorse mythological foes, like \ndark elves, \nwulvers, and \ndraugrs,\n[12] as well as \nGullveig and the \nrevenants, beings warped by \nseiðr magic, among many others.\n[13] \nValkyries appear as optional secret \nboss battles throughout the six playable locations.\n[14] Among the many \nside quests, players can free the imprisoned \ndragons \nFáfnir, \nOtr, and \nReginn—\ndwarves who were turned into dragons—in addition to battling one called Hræzlyr, a story-based boss battle.\n[10][15]The player controls the character \nKratos in \ncombo-based combat and \npuzzle game elements. The \ngameplay is vastly different from previous games, as it was completely rebuilt.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress we've made:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Award in 2019 is \"God of War.\"\n   - The task involves finding the Wikipedia page for \"God of War.\"\n   - The number of revisions to the Wikipedia page before the game's release month needs to be counted.\n   - The most recent entry from 2022 on the Wikipedia page should be used to determine the release date.\n   - The release date of \"God of War\" is April 20, 2018.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page for \"God of War,\" specifically the number of revisions before April 2018.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of revisions to the Wikipedia page before April 2018 can be derived by counting the revisions in the page history up to the specified date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The game \"God of War\" is a well-known and critically acclaimed title, which suggests that the Wikipedia page likely had a significant amount of activity before its release.\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page can be accessed through the page's \"View history\" tab, and the number of revisions can be counted manually or using a script.\n   - Given the popularity and anticipation of \"God of War,\" the page likely saw frequent updates and edits leading up to its release date.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Navigate to the \"View history\" tab of the \"God of War\" Wikipedia page.\n- Count the number of revisions made to the page before April 2018.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step. Can you navigate to the \"View history\" tab of the \"God of War\" Wikipedia page and start counting the revisions made before April 2018?\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Miscommunication and Redundancy**: We repeatedly navigated to the references section of the Wikipedia page instead of the \"View history\" tab, which led to a loop of unproductive actions.\n- **Lack of Clear Instructions**: The instructions to navigate to the \"View history\" tab were not emphasized enough, leading to repeated clicks on the \"References\" section.\n- **Inefficient Task Execution**: We did not break down the task into smaller, more manageable steps, which could have helped avoid the redundancy.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Navigate to the \"View history\" Tab**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the \"View history\" tab of the \"God of War\" Wikipedia page.\n   \n2. **Count Revisions Before April 2018**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the revision history and count the number of revisions made before April 2018.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the number of revisions is large, consider using the search function within the revision history to find the first revision after April 2018 and count backwards.\n\n3. **Report the Number of Revisions**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Provide the total number of revisions counted before April 2018.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the \"View history\" tab.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on the \"View history\" tab located at the top of the \"God of War\" Wikipedia page.\n\n- **Step 2**: Count the revisions.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the revision history.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for the first revision made after April 2018.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Count the number of revisions from the earliest revision to the revision just before April 2018.\n\n- **Step 3**: Report the result.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Provide the total number of revisions counted.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Emphasize the \"View history\" Tab**: Clearly state the need to click on the \"View history\" tab to avoid confusion.\n- **Use Search Function**: If the revision history is extensive, use the search function (Ctrl + F) to find the first revision after April 2018 and count backwards from there.\n- **Double-check the Date**: Ensure that the date used for counting is April 2018, as this is the release month of the game.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan."}

It began in 2005 on the \nPlayStation 2 (PS2) \nvideo game console and has become a flagship series for \nPlayStation, consisting of nine installments across multiple platforms. Based on ancient \nmythologies, the series' plot follows \nKratos, a \nSpartan warrior who becomes the \nGod of War and comes into conflict with various mythological \npantheons. The earlier games in the series are based on \nGreek mythology and see Kratos follow a path of vengeance against the \nOlympian gods; the later games are based on \nNorse mythology and see Kratos on a path of redemption while also introducing his son \nAtreus as a secondary protagonist, as they come into conflict or interact with various \nNorse deities and figures. \nSanta Monica Studio has developed all main entries, while \nReady at Dawn and \nJavaground/\nSony Online Entertainment-Los Angeles (SOE-LA) developed the three side games. \nSony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) has published all games except the mobile phone installment, which was published by \nSony Pictures Digital. The first seven games make up the Greek era of the franchise. \nGod of War (2005), \nGod of War II (2007) and \nGod of War III (2010) comprise its main trilogy; the first two were released on the PS2 with the third on the \nPlayStation 3 (PS3). A prequel, \nAscension (2013), was also released for the PS3. Other games include \nChains of Olympus (2008) and \nGhost of Sparta (2010) for the \nPlayStation Portable (PSP) and \nBetrayal (2007) for mobile phones that supported the \nJava Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME). The Norse era began with the 2018 game \nGod of War, which was released for the \nPlayStation 4 (PS4) and later \nWindows in January 2022. It was accompanied by a short prequel, \nA Call from the Wilds (2018), a \ntext-based game through \nFacebook Messenger. A sequel, \nRagnarök, was released in November 2022 for the PS4 and \nPlayStation 5 (PS5) and concluded the Norse era, which received an epilogue in the form of an\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"God of War (franchise)\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(franchise)\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q390137\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q390137\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2008-03-14T01:08:14Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-16T15:07:36Z\",\n        \"headline\": \"video game series and franchise\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"God of War (franchise) - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress we've made:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Award in 2019 is \"God of War.\"\n   - The task involves finding the Wikipedia page for \"God of War.\"\n   - The number of revisions to the Wikipedia page before the game's release month needs to be counted.\n   - The most recent entry from 2022 on the Wikipedia page should be used to determine the release date.\n   - The release date of \"God of War\" is April 20, 2018.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page for \"God of War,\" specifically the number of revisions before April 2018.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of revisions to the Wikipedia page before April 2018 can be derived by counting the revisions in the page history up to the specified date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The game \"God of War\" is a well-known and critically acclaimed title, which suggests that the Wikipedia page likely had a significant amount of activity before its release.\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page can be accessed through the page's \"View history\" tab, and the number of revisions can be counted manually or using a script.\n   - Given the popularity and anticipation of \"God of War,\" the page likely saw frequent updates and edits leading up to its release date.\n   - The revision history is extensive, and using the search function (Ctrl + F) to find the first revision after April 2018 will help in counting the revisions before that date.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the \"View history\" tab of the \"God of War\" Wikipedia page.**\n2. **Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to find the first revision after April 2018.**\n3. **Count the number of revisions made to the page before April 2018.**\n\nLet's proceed with the next step. Can you navigate to the \"View history\" tab of the \"God of War\" Wikipedia page and use the search function to find the first revision after April 2018? Then, count the number of revisions before that date.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Excessive Context Length**: The previous attempts to generate replies or navigate the page resulted in errors due to the model's maximum context length being exceeded (32768 tokens). This indicates that the conversation history or the content being processed was too long.\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: The process of manually scrolling through the revision history and searching for the first revision after April 2018 was not efficient and led to repeated errors.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Navigate to the \"View history\" tab of the \"God of War\" Wikipedia page.**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the \"View history\" tab of the \"God of War\" Wikipedia page.\n\n2. **Use the search function to find the first revision after April 2018.**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to find \"April 2018\" in the revision history.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the first revision that appears after April 2018.\n\n3. **Count the number of revisions before the identified revision.**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the revision history and count the number of revisions before the identified revision.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the number of revisions is large, use the search function to find key dates (e.g., \"March 2018\") to help narrow down the count.\n\n4. **Report the total number of revisions.**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Provide the total number of revisions counted before April 2018.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the \"View history\" tab.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on the \"View history\" tab located at the top of the \"God of War\" Wikipedia page.\n\n- **Step 2**: Use the search function to find the first revision after April 2018.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Press Ctrl + F and type \"April 2018\" to find the first revision after April 2018.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the first revision that appears after April 2018.\n\n- **Step 3**: Count the number of revisions before the identified revision.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the revision history and count the number of revisions before the identified revision.\n  - **WebSurfer**: If the number of revisions is large, use the search function to find key dates (e.g., \"March 2018\") to help narrow down the count.\n\n- **Step 4**: Report the total number of revisions.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Provide the total number of revisions counted before April 2018.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Efficient Search**: Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to quickly find key dates and revisions.\n- **Avoid Excessive Context**: Focus on the specific task of counting revisions and avoid including unnecessary details in the conversation to prevent exceeding the context length.\n- **Break Down the Task**: If the revision history is very long, break down the task into smaller segments (e.g., count revisions in chunks of 50 or 100).\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. Can you navigate to the \"View history\" tab of the \"God of War\" Wikipedia page and use the search function to find the first revision after April 2018? Then, count the number of revisions before that date."}

It began in 2005 on the \nPlayStation 2 (PS2) \nvideo game console and has become a flagship series for \nPlayStation, consisting of nine installments across multiple platforms. Based on ancient \nmythologies, the series' plot follows \nKratos, a \nSpartan warrior who becomes the \nGod of War and comes into conflict with various mythological \npantheons. The earlier games in the series are based on \nGreek mythology and see Kratos follow a path of vengeance against the \nOlympian gods; the later games are based on \nNorse mythology and see Kratos on a path of redemption while also introducing his son \nAtreus as a secondary protagonist, as they come into conflict or interact with various \nNorse deities and figures. \nSanta Monica Studio has developed all main entries, while \nReady at Dawn and \nJavaground/\nSony Online Entertainment-Los Angeles (SOE-LA) developed the three side games. \nSony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) has published all games except the mobile phone installment, which was published by \nSony Pictures Digital. The first seven games make up the Greek era of the franchise. \nGod of War (2005), \nGod of War II (2007) and \nGod of War III (2010) comprise its main trilogy; the first two were released on the PS2 with the third on the \nPlayStation 3 (PS3). A prequel, \nAscension (2013), was also released for the PS3. Other games include \nChains of Olympus (2008) and \nGhost of Sparta (2010) for the \nPlayStation Portable (PSP) and \nBetrayal (2007) for mobile phones that supported the \nJava Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME). The Norse era began with the 2018 game \nGod of War, which was released for the \nPlayStation 4 (PS4) and later \nWindows in January 2022. It was accompanied by a short prequel, \nA Call from the Wilds (2018), a \ntext-based game through \nFacebook Messenger.
