It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series must be rated according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A comprehensive list of all series in which Ted Danson has starred.\n   - The number of seasons for each series.\n   - The Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series.\n   - The availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which of the series with more than 1 season has the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Ted Danson has starred in several well-known series, such as \"Cheers,\" \"The Good Place,\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" but these are likely not the worst-rated series he has been in.\n   - Some of his less popular or more recent series might have lower ratings and could be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Based on the partial list from TV Guide, some of the series with multiple seasons include \"Cheers\" (11 seasons), \"Frasier\" (11 seasons), \"The Good Place\" (4 seasons), \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" (10 seasons), and \"Mr. Mayor\" (2 seasons). These are known to be highly rated, so they are unlikely to be the worst-rated series.\n   - Lesser-known series like \"Damages\" (5 seasons), \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" (15 seasons), and \"King of the Hill\" (13 seasons) might have lower ratings and could be worth checking.\n   - Series with fewer seasons but still more than one, such as \"Grosse Pointe\" (2 seasons) and \"Mumford\" (1 season), should also be considered, although \"Mumford\" does not meet the criteria of having more than 1 season.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to compile a comprehensive list of all TV series starring Ted Danson, including the number of seasons for each.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to find the Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series.\n- **Step 3:** Use WebSurfer to check the availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **Step 4:** Derive the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating that meets all criteria.\n- **Step 5:** Verify the final result and provide the name of the series.\n\n### Action:\nPlease continue to compile the full list of TV series starring Ted Danson, including the number of seasons for each, and provide the information in a structured format. If possible, also note any series that have more than 1 season.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Incomplete Data Collection:** The previous attempts did not fully capture the list of TV series starring Ted Danson, particularly the number of seasons for each series.\n- **Lack of Structured Information:** The data collected was not organized in a structured format, making it difficult to filter and analyze.\n- **Manual Scrolling:** The process of manually scrolling through the page was inefficient and did not ensure that all relevant information was captured.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to navigate to a reliable source (e.g., IMDb or TV Guide) and extract a comprehensive list of TV series starring Ted Danson.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to automatically scroll through the page and capture the names of the series and the number of seasons for each.\n- **Step 3:** Use WebSurfer to search for the Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series.\n- **Step 4:** Use WebSurfer to check the availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **Step 5:** Filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season, available on Amazon Prime Video (US), and with Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n- **Step 6:** Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating that meets all criteria.\n- **Step 7:** Verify the final result and provide the name of the series.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Navigate to a Reliable Source:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to IMDb or TV Guide and search for \"TV series starring Ted Danson.\"\n\n2. **Extract Comprehensive List:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to automatically scroll through the page and capture the names of the series and the number of seasons for each.\n   - Store the information in a structured format (e.g., a list of dictionaries).\n\n3. **Find Rotten Tomatoes Ratings:**\n   - For each series, use WebSurfer to search for its Rotten Tomatoes rating.\n   - Store the ratings in the structured format.\n\n4. **Check Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US):**\n   - For each series, use WebSurfer to check its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Store the availability information in the structured format.\n\n5. **Filter and Analyze:**\n   - Filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season, available on Amazon Prime Video (US), and with Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n   - Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating.\n\n6. **Verify and Provide Final Result:**\n   - Verify the final result by cross-referencing the information.\n   - Provide the name of the series.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges:\n- **Automate Scrolling:** Use WebSurfer to automatically scroll through the page to ensure all data is captured.\n- **Structured Data Storage:** Use a list of dictionaries to store the series names, number of seasons, Rotten Tomatoes ratings, and availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **Efficient Data Collection:** Ensure that each step captures the necessary information without manual intervention.\n\n### Action:\nPlease navigate to IMDb or TV Guide and extract a comprehensive list of TV series starring Ted Danson, including the number of seasons for each series.

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series must be rated according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A comprehensive list of all series in which Ted Danson has starred.\n   - The number of seasons for each series.\n   - The Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series.\n   - The availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which of the series with more than 1 season has the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Ted Danson has starred in several well-known series, such as \"Cheers,\" \"The Good Place,\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" but these are likely not the worst-rated series he has been in.\n   - Some of his less popular or more recent series might have lower ratings and could be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Based on the partial list from IMDb, some of the series with multiple seasons include:\n     - \"Cheers\" (11 seasons)\n     - \"Frasier\" (11 seasons) - Note: Ted Danson did not star in \"Frasier,\" but it's a related show.\n     - \"The Good Place\" (4 seasons)\n     - \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" (10 seasons)\n     - \"Mr. Mayor\" (2 seasons)\n     - \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" (15 seasons) - Ted Danson joined in later seasons.\n     - \"Damages\" (5 seasons)\n     - \"Mulligan\" (1 season) - Does not meet the criteria.\n     - \"American Dad!\" (20 seasons) - Voice role.\n   - Lesser-known series like \"Grosse Pointe\" (2 seasons) and \"Ink\" (1 season) should also be considered, although \"Ink\" does not meet the criteria of having more than 1 season.\n   - Series with fewer seasons but still more than one, such as \"Grosse Pointe\" (2 seasons), should be checked for ratings and availability.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to compile a comprehensive list of all TV series starring Ted Danson, including the number of seasons for each.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to find the Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series.\n- **Step 3:** Use WebSurfer to check the availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **Step 4:** Derive the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating that meets all criteria.\n- **Step 5:** Verify the final result and provide the name of the series.\n\n### Action:\nPlease continue to compile the full list of TV series starring Ted Danson, including the number of seasons for each, and provide the information in a structured format. If possible, also note any series that have more than 1 season. Specifically, focus on the lesser-known series and those with more than 1 season to ensure we cover all possibilities.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Incomplete Data Collection:** The previous attempts did not fully capture the list of TV series starring Ted Danson, particularly the number of seasons for each series.\n- **Lack of Structured Information:** The data collected was not organized in a structured format, making it difficult to filter and analyze.\n- **Manual Scrolling:** The process of manually scrolling through the page was inefficient and did not ensure that all relevant information was captured.\n- **Insufficient Verification:** There was no systematic verification of the availability of the series on Amazon Prime Video (US) and their Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to navigate to Ted Danson's IMDb profile page.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to automatically scroll through the page and capture the names of the series and the number of seasons for each series. Store the information in a structured format (e.g., a list of dictionaries).\n- **Step 3:** Use WebSurfer to search for the Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series. Store the ratings in the structured format.\n- **Step 4:** Use WebSurfer to check the availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US). Store the availability information in the structured format.\n- **Step 5:** Filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season, available on Amazon Prime Video (US), and with Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n- **Step 6:** Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating that meets all criteria.\n- **Step 7:** Verify the final result and provide the name of the series.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Navigate to IMDb Profile:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to Ted Danson's IMDb profile page: `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001101/`.\n\n2. **Extract Comprehensive List:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to automatically scroll through the page and capture the names of the series and the number of seasons for each series.\n   - Store the information in a structured format (e.g., a list of dictionaries).\n\n3. **Find Rotten Tomatoes Ratings:**\n   - For each series, use WebSurfer to search for its Rotten Tomatoes rating.\n   - Store the ratings in the structured format.\n\n4. **Check Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US):**\n   - For each series, use WebSurfer to check its availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Store the availability information in the structured format.\n\n5. **Filter and Analyze:**\n   - Filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season, available on Amazon Prime Video (US), and with Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n   - Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating.\n\n6. **Verify and Provide Final Result:**\n   - Verify the final result by cross-referencing the information.\n   - Provide the name of the series.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges:\n- **Automate Scrolling:** Use WebSurfer to automatically scroll through the page to ensure all data is captured.\n- **Structured Data Storage:** Use a list of dictionaries to store the series names, number of seasons, Rotten Tomatoes ratings, and availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **Efficient Data Collection:** Ensure that each step captures the necessary information without manual intervention.\n- **Verification:** Double-check the availability on Amazon Prime Video (US) and the Rotten Tomatoes ratings to avoid errors.\n\n### Action:\nPlease navigate to Ted Danson's IMDb profile page and extract a comprehensive list of TV series starring Ted Danson, including the number of seasons for each series.
