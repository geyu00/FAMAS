Please solve the task carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US).\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The movie expert will identify all the movies featuring Daniel Craig.\n2. The data analyst will check the IMDB ratings and filter the movies based on the duration (less than 150 minutes).\n3. The streaming service expert will verify the availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n4. The data analyst will then identify the highest rated movie from the filtered list.\n\n## Output format\n- The title of the highest rated Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US).\n- The IMDB rating of the movie.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n- The movie must be less than 150 minutes in duration.\n- The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n- The IMDB rating must be used to determine the highest rated movie.\n\n## Results and reason from last response\nThe only confirmed movie available on Netflix (US) so far is \"Layer Cake (2004)\".\n\nErrors or issues in the conversation:\n1. A code execution error occurred when attempting to perform web searches for multiple movies, resulting in only partial information being obtained.\n2.
