{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the worst rated series (according to Rotten Tomatoes) with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series should be rated according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n   - We are looking for the worst-rated series based on the criteria above.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of all TV series in which Ted Danson has starred.\n   - Number of seasons for each of these series.\n   - Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each of these series.\n   - Availability of these series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Filter out series with only one season.\n   - Identify the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score among the remaining series.\n   - Confirm the availability of the identified series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Ted Danson has starred in several well-known series, such as \"Cheers,\" \"The Good Place,\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\" However, these are likely to have high ratings.\n   - A less popular or more recent series might have a lower rating.\n   - Series like \"Becker\" or \"Bored to Death\" could be potential candidates, but their ratings and availability need to be verified.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify Ted Danson's TV Series**: Use WebSurfer to search for a comprehensive list of TV series in which Ted Danson has starred.\n- **Filter Series by Seasons**: Use WebSurfer to check the number of seasons for each series and filter out those with only one season.\n- **Check Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**: Use WebSurfer to find the Rotten Tomatoes ratings for the remaining series.\n- **Verify Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**: Use WebSurfer to check if the series are available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **Determine the Worst-Rated Series**: Compare the Rotten Tomatoes ratings of the filtered series to identify the worst-rated one that meets all criteria.\n- **Confirm and Report**: Once the series is identified, confirm all details and report the findings."}

Instead of the show being focused around home and friends, Becker is focused around work and his two employees that work for him and his favorite diner.

He hires smart, uptight -- and jilted -- Diane Chambers as a server, out of sympathy, but their attraction causes constant bickering. Wacky characters fill the bar: sarcastic waitress Carla, beer-loving accountant Norm, know-it-all postman Cliff. When Diane leaves Boston much later, Sam sells the bar, buys a boat and sails the world, but his boat sinks, so he returns. New, ambitious manager Rebecca Howe hires him back, but they love to hate each other too. \nWatch on Fandango at Home\n Buy Now \nWhere to Watch\nSeasons\nCast & Crew\nMore Like This\nRelated News\nPhotos\nMedia Info\nWhat to Watch\nIn Theaters\nAt Home\nTV Shows\nNew TV Tonight\n View All \nNew TV TonightIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n94%\nCountdown\n38%\nStick\n81%\nThe Summer I Turned Pretty\n75%\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"TVSeries\",\n        \"actor\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Ted Danson\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ted_danson\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/mbpkYQOqQ9xCBz8C3msqV7To5c0=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/GNLZZGG0024P4MZ.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Rhea Perlman\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/rhea_perlman\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/C7xJMxIyN8QSkY42kcUs2bslZKQ=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/1336_v9_bb.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"George Wendt\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/george_wendt\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/udOIh_ycjQHdJXY426XUzvgoRA0=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/1905_v9_ba.jpg\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"aggregateRating\": {\n            \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n            \"bestRating\": \"100\",\n            \"description\": \"The Tomatometer rating \\u2013 based on the published opinions of hundreds of film and television critics \\u2013 is a trusted measurement of movie and TV programming quality for millions of moviegoers.
