Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of movies featuring Daniel Craig.\n   - The IMDB ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The availability of each of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated movie among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Daniel Craig has starred in several James Bond films, which are generally well-received and have runtimes that could potentially fit the criteria.\n   - Some of his non-Bond films, such as \"Knives Out,\" are also highly rated and might be available on Netflix (US).\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify Daniel Craig's Movies**: Use WebSurfer to search for a comprehensive list of Daniel Craig's movies.\n- **Filter by Runtime**: Use WebSurfer to check the runtime of each movie and filter out those that are 150 minutes or longer.\n- **Check IMDB Ratings**: Use WebSurfer to find the IMDB ratings for the remaining movies.\n- **Check Netflix Availability**: Use WebSurfer to verify which of the filtered movies are available on Netflix (US).\n- **Determine the Highest-Rated Movie**: Compare the IMDB ratings of the movies that meet all criteria and identify the highest-rated one.\n- **Report the Result**: Provide the title of the highest-rated movie that meets all the criteria."}
