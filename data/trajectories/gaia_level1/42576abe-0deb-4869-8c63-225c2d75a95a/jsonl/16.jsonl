Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sentence structure in Tizin is Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n   - The word for oneself in Tizin: \"Pa\" (nominative), \"Mato\" (accusative), \"Sing\" (genitive).\n   - The root verb for an intense like for something is \"Maktay\".\n     - Present tense: \"Maktay\"\n     - Preterit past: \"Tay\"\n     - Imperfect past: \"Aktay\"\n   - The verb \"Maktay\" translates better as \"is pleasing to\".\n   - The word for apples in Tizin: \"Apple\" (nominative), \"Zapple\" (accusative), \"Izapple\" (genitive).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - No specific facts need to be looked up as all necessary information is provided in the request.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The correct form of the verb \"Maktay\" to use in the present tense.\n   - The correct placement of the words in the sentence structure (Verb + Direct Object + Subject).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The sentence \"I like apples\" in Tizin will likely use the present tense form of \"Maktay\" since it describes a current state.\n   - The subject \"I\" (Pa) will be placed at the end of the sentence.\n   - The direct object \"apples\" (Zapple) will be placed after the verb.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Confirm the sentence structure in Tizin (Verb + Direct Object + Subject) and the appropriate forms of the words provided.\n- Identify the correct form of the verb \"Maktay\" for the present tense.\n- Construct the sentence \"I like apples\" in Tizin using the given rules and word forms.\n- Verify the constructed sentence for accuracy and correctness.\n\nGiven the straightforward nature of the task and the information provided, the primary role will be played by the Assistant. The other team members (ComputerTerminal, FileSurfer, WebSurfer) are not necessary for this task as it does not involve scripting, file handling, or web searching."}

{"agent": "Assistant", "content": "Based on the information provided, let's construct the sentence \"I like apples\" in Tizin.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify the correct form of the verb \"Maktay\" for the present tense.\n2. Use the accusative form of \"apples\" since it is the direct object.\n3. Place the words in the correct order: Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n\n### Translation:\n- The verb \"like\" in the present tense is \"Maktay\".\n- The direct object \"apples\" in the accusative form is \"Zapple\".\n- The subject \"I\" in the nominative form is \"Pa\".\n\nSo, the sentence \"I like apples\" in Tizin would be:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Maktay Zapple Pa\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the translation.\n```python\nprint(\"Maktay Zapple Pa\")\n```"}
