Here's the command to execute:\n\n```sh\npip install yt-dlp\n```\n\n### Step 2: Download Video\n\nAfter confirming the installation, I will use `yt-dlp` to download the video from the provided link. \n\nHere's the command I will run in the terminal:\n\n```sh\nyt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM -o \"downloaded_video.mp4\"\n```\n\n### Step 3: Frame Extraction\n\nOnce the video is successfully downloaded, I will update the Python script with the correct path to the downloaded video. The path will be `downloaded_video.mp4` as we specified during the download.\n\nNow, let's execute the installation command to ensure `yt-dlp` is installed first. \n\nExecuting the command now."}
