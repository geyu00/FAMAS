Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Family composition: 2 adults, 1 kid age 5, 1 kid age 2\n   - Number of visits per year: 4\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Cost of an annual pass for adults\n   - Cost of an annual pass for children (age 5 and under)\n   - Cost of a daily ticket for adults\n   - Cost of a daily ticket for children (age 5 and under)\n   - Specific website or official source for Seattle Children's Museum pricing (e.g., museum website)\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Total cost of annual passes for the family\n   - Total cost of daily tickets for 4 visits\n   - Savings by choosing annual passes over daily tickets\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Annual passes are likely to offer a discount compared to daily tickets, especially for frequent visitors.\n   - Children under a certain age (e.g., 2 years old) might have free admission, both for daily tickets and annual passes.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** WebSurfer to visit the official Seattle Children's Museum website and find the current pricing for annual passes and daily tickets.\n  - **Subtask:** Identify the cost of annual passes for adults and children (ages 5 and under).\n  - **Subtask:** Identify the cost of daily tickets for adults and children (ages 5 and under).\n\n- **Step 2:** Calculate the total cost of annual passes for the family.\n  - **Subtask:** Assistant to compute the total cost using the prices obtained from WebSurfer.\n\n- **Step 3:** Calculate the total cost of daily tickets for 4 visits.\n  - **Subtask:** Assistant to compute the total cost using the prices obtained from WebSurfer.\n\n- **Step 4:** Determine the savings by comparing the total cost of annual passes to the total cost of daily tickets for 4 visits.\n  - **Subtask:** Assistant to compute the savings.\n\n- **Step 5:** Present the final savings amount to the user."}
