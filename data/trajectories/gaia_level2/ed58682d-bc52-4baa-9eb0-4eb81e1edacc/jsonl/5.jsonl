Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The artist in question is the \"King of Pop,\" which is Michael Jackson.\n   - The song in question is the fifth single from Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The title of Michael Jackson's sixth studio album.\n   - The track listing and singles from that album.\n   - The lyrics of the specific single to identify the last word before the second chorus.\n   - These facts can be found on music databases, official discographies, and lyric websites such as AllMusic, Discogs, and Genius.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identifying the exact single based on its position (fifth) in the release order of the sixth studio album.\n   - Determining the structure of the song to locate the second chorus and the word immediately preceding it.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Michael Jackson's sixth studio album is likely \"Bad,\" released in 1987.\n   - The fifth single from \"Bad\" is probably \"Smooth Criminal.\"\n   - However, these are educated guesses and need verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Album and Single:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Search for Michael Jackson's sixth studio album and confirm its name.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Find the track listing and singles from that album to identify the fifth single.\n\n- **Locate the Lyrics:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Search for the lyrics of the identified single.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Locate the section of the lyrics that includes the second chorus.\n\n- **Determine the Last Word:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Identify the last word before the second chorus in the lyrics.\n\n- **Verify and Report:**\n  - **Assistant:** Compile the information and verify the accuracy.\n  - **Assistant:** Provide the final answer to the original request."}
