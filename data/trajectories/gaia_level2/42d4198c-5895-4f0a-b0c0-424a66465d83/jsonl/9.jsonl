Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The task involves finding the Wikipedia page for this game.\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the month of the game's release date needs to be counted.\n   - The release date is as of the most recent entry from 2022.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Award.\n   - The specific month and year of the game's release date, as listed on its Wikipedia page.\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page for the game, specifically the number of revisions before the month of the game's release date.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the specified month and year of the game's release date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The 2019 British Academy Games Award-winning game is likely a well-known title, but without looking it up, I cannot specify which one.\n   - The release date of the game is likely to be clearly stated on its Wikipedia page.\n   - The Wikipedia revision history can be accessed through the page's \"View history\" tab, and the number of revisions can be counted by filtering the history to the period before the release date.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the 2019 British Academy Games Award-winning game:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search to find the name of the 2019 British Academy Games Award-winning game.\n  \n- **Find the Wikipedia page for the identified game:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Open the Wikipedia page for the identified game and locate the release date.\n\n- **Determine the number of revisions before the release date:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the \"View history\" tab of the Wikipedia page.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Filter the revision history to show only revisions before the month and year of the game's release date.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Count the number of revisions in the filtered history.\n\n- **Report the findings:**\n  - **Assistant:** Compile the results and provide the final answer."}

The game was released worldwide for the \nPlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a \nWindows port released in January 2022. It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are basically 2 protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and \ngods of the Norse world. \nDescribed by creative director \nCory Barlog as a reimagining of the franchise, a major \ngameplay change is that Kratos makes prominent use of a magical \nbattle axe known as the Leviathan Axe instead of his signature \ndouble-chained blades called the Blades of Chaos. The game also uses an \nover-the-shoulder free camera, with the game in \none shot, as opposed to the \nfixed cinematic camera of the previous entries. It also includes \nrole-playing game elements, and Kratos's son Atreus provides assistance in combat. The majority of the original game's development team worked on \nGod of War and designed it to be accessible and grounded. A separate short \ntext-based game, \nA Call from the Wilds, was released in February 2018 through \nFacebook Messenger and follows Atreus on his first adventure.

Barlog released the overture as a thank you to fans for \nGod of War's E3 2016 trailer reaching fifteen million views on YouTube.\n[71]Release[edit]The game was released worldwide on April 20, 2018, for the PlayStation 4.\n[51] In addition to the standard base game, there were three special editions: the Stone Mason Edition, the Collector's Edition, and the Digital Deluxe Edition. The Stone Mason Edition was only available in the United States and Canada and came with several physical items, including: the base game in a SteelBook case, a 9-inch (230 mm) statue of Kratos and Atreus created by Gentle Giant, 2-inch (51 mm) carvings of the Huldra Brothers, a horse, and a troll, an exclusive \nlithograph, a cloth map, a \nstonemason's ring, and a keychain of Mímir's head that talks. There was a variety of \ndownloadable content (DLC), including an exclusive shield skin, as well as an armor set and another shield skin for Kratos, a PlayStation 4 dynamic theme, a digital artbook, and \nGod of War #0 by \nDark Horse Comics.\n[72] The Collector's Edition came with many of the same items, minus the ring, the keychain, the carvings of the horse and troll, and the exclusive shield skin. The Digital Deluxe Edition came with all the digital content, minus the exclusive shield skin. U.S. and Canadian customers also received a Kratos and Atreus \npin for pre-ordering the Digital Deluxe Edition. Pre-orders at select retailers received three skins for Kratos's shield. Pre-orders from \nGameStop or \nEB Games also received the \"Luck of Ages XP Talisman\", granting increased XP and Hacksilver gains and increased ability to trigger perks.\n[73]In addition to the special editions of the game, a Limited Edition PlayStation 4 Pro bundle was available the same day as the game's release. The bundle included the standard base game, a PlayStation 4 Pro console decorated with the runes on Kratos's axe, and a similarly themed \nDualShock 4 controller with the \nGod of War logo.\n[74] Additionally, an official \ntabletop \ncard game titled \nGod of War: The Card Game was released by \nCMON Limited on October 25, 2019. Created by Alexandru Olteanu and Fel Barros, players take on the role of the \nNorns, the \nFates of Norse mythology, as they try to prevent Ragnarök with different combinations of characters and events from the game, providing many variations to completing the card game.\n[75][76][77]Prior to launch, Barlog confirmed that \nGod of War would not have \nmicrotransactions, a feature that had become prominent with other games and criticized.\n[78] He also confirmed that the game would not have post-release DLC, like an \nexpansion pack. He said he had pitched an idea for DLC, \"but it was too ambitious\". His idea was similar in scope to that of \nThe Last of Us: Left Behind (2014) and \nUncharted: The Lost Legacy (2017), large standalone expansions for \nThe Last of Us (2013) and \nUncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016), respectively. He said it would have been too big to be DLC, warranting its own standalone release.\n[79]Post-launch, Santa Monica supported the game with \npatch updates to address \nsoftware bugs. As well, the developers added new features along with these free updates. A Photo Mode was released as part of update patch 1.20 on May 9, 2018. It allows players to take customized in-game screenshots. Players can adjust the field of view, depth of view, filters, borders, the visibility of characters, and the ability to change the facial expressions of Kratos and Atreus.\n[80] A \nNew Game Plus mode was released as part of update patch 1.30 on August 20, 2018. To access the mode, players must have completed the game at any difficulty level. The mode itself can be played at any difficulty, but enemies are at a higher level with new maneuvers. All obtained items carry over to New Game Plus, and there are new resources to further upgrade gear, which also have new rarity levels. The option to skip cutscenes was also added.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

A sequel, \nGod of War Ragnarök, was released for the PlayStation 4 and \nPlayStation 5 in November 2022, and for Windows in 2024. \nGameplay[edit]God of War is a \nthird-person \naction-adventure video game. It features an \nover-the-shoulder free camera (a departure from the previous installments which featured a \nfixed cinematic camera, with the exception of 2007's \ntwo-dimensional \nside-scrollerBetrayal).\n[7] Cinematographically, the game is presented in a \ncontinuous shot, with no \ncamera cuts or \nloading screens.\n[8] Although the previous main installment, \nAscension (2013), introduced \nmultiplayer to the series, this installment is \nsingle-player-only.\n[4] Regarding the level structure, creative director \nCory Barlog said \"it's open, but it is not an \nopen world.\"\n[9] Due to its openness, a \nfast travel feature is unlocked later in the game.\n[10] Swimming, an ability in previous games, was cut;\n[11] players instead use a boat to traverse bodies of water.\n[10] Unlike previous games, which allowed players to jump freely at any time, jumping can now only be done at designated areas, such as at a rock face or ledge. Throughout the game, players battle \nNorse mythological foes, like \ndark elves, \nwulvers, and \ndraugrs,\n[12] as well as \nGullveig and the \nrevenants, beings warped by \nseiðr magic, among many others.\n[13] \nValkyries appear as optional secret \nboss battles throughout the six playable locations.\n[14] Among the many \nside quests, players can free the imprisoned \ndragons \nFáfnir, \nOtr, and \nReginn—\ndwarves who were turned into dragons—in addition to battling one called Hræzlyr, a story-based boss battle.\n[10][15] A \nGIF showing \nKratos throwing the Leviathan Axe to magically freeze an enemy \ndraugr in place, allowing Kratos to easily attack it. The in-game \nHUD can be seen in the bottom left and right corners. The left shows information for Kratos, such as his \nhealth and what \nrunic attacks are equipped. The right shows similar information for \nAtreus.\nThe player controls the character \nKratos in \ncombo-based combat and \npuzzle game elements. The \ngameplay is vastly different from previous games, as it was completely rebuilt.\n[9] A major change is that Kratos no longer uses his signature \ndouble-chained blades, the Blades of Chaos, as his default weapon. Instead, he uses a magical \nbattle axe called the Leviathan Axe,\n[16] which is infused with ice elemental \nmagic. The axe can be thrown at enemies and magically summoned back to his hand, similar to \nThor's hammer \nMjölnir. Larger enemies have precision targets which stun the enemy if hit. The weapon can also be thrown at objects in the game world to freeze or move mechanisms, or trigger damaging explosions, until returned to Kratos's hand. The axe has standard light and heavy attacks. Over time, it can be upgraded with \nrunes to allow for light and heavy magical \"runic\" attacks. This provides players with a variety of options to cater to their own play style.\n[17] Another new weapon that Kratos utilizes is the collapsible Guardian Shield, which appears as a \nvambrace on his left forearm when not in use. The shield can be used offensively or defensively, similar to the \nGolden Fleece in previous games.\n[18] Kratos also utilizes hand-to-hand combat, a feature originally introduced in \nAscension.\n[7] The Blades of Chaos, infused with fire elemental magic, are acquired later in the game via a plot device and perform in a similar manner as in previous installments—they are a pair of blades\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
