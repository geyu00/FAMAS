{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when Regression was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when Regression was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - This information can be found on GitHub by searching through the numpy repository issues, filtering for closed issues, and then identifying the oldest issue with the Regression label.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which of the closed numpy.polynomial issues is the oldest among those labeled with Regression.\n   - Extracting the exact date when the Regression label was added to this issue.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The numpy project is well-maintained, so the issue tracking system is likely to have accurate and detailed records.\n   - Given the popularity and history of numpy, the oldest closed issue with the Regression label could potentially be several years old.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to navigate to the numpy GitHub repository.\n- **Step 2:** Filter the issues to show only closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Step 3:** Identify the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Step 4:** Extract the date when the \"Regression\" label was added to this issue.\n- **Step 5:** Format the date in MM/DD/YY format.\n- **Step 6:** Provide the final answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress and insights gained so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when the Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The numpy repository on GitHub has a large number of issues, and we have filtered the issues to show only closed issues with the Regression label.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when the Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - This information can be found on GitHub by navigating through the filtered issues and identifying the oldest issue related to numpy.polynomial.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which of the closed numpy.polynomial issues is the oldest among those labeled with Regression.\n   - Extracting the exact date when the Regression label was added to this issue.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The numpy project is well-maintained, so the issue tracking system is likely to have accurate and detailed records.\n   - Given the popularity and history of numpy, the oldest closed issue with the Regression label could potentially be several years old.\n   - The process of finding the oldest issue with the Regression label might require scrolling through multiple pages of issues, as the relevant issue might be buried deep within the list.\n   - The numpy.polynomial module is a significant part of numpy, so there is a reasonable chance that there are regression issues related to it, even if they are not among the most recent ones.\n\n**REASONING FOR UPDATED EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **Detailed Records**: The numpy project's well-maintained nature suggests that the issue tracking system will have accurate timestamps and labels, which will help in identifying the exact date when the Regression label was added.\n- **Potential Age of Issues**: The long history and widespread use of numpy indicate that there could be older issues with the Regression label, possibly dating back several years.\n- **Scrolling Through Pages**: Since the issues are listed in reverse chronological order (newest first), the oldest issue with the Regression label is likely to be found deeper in the list, requiring us to scroll through multiple pages.\n- **Significance of numpy.polynomial**: The numpy.polynomial module is an important part of the numpy library, so it is reasonable to expect that there are regression issues related to it, even if they are not the most recent ones.\n\nNext steps:\n- Continue scrolling through the filtered issues to find the oldest closed issue with the Regression label that is related to numpy.polynomial.\n- Once identified, extract the date when the Regression label was added to this issue.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Inefficient Scrolling and Filtering**: The process of manually scrolling through pages to find the oldest issue with the Regression label is inefficient and prone to missing the target issue.\n- **Lack of Specific Search Criteria**: The search criteria did not specifically include \"numpy.polynomial,\" which is crucial for narrowing down the issues.\n- **Manual Identification**: Manually identifying the oldest issue is time-consuming and error-prone, especially given the large number of issues.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Refine the Search Query**: Use a more specific search query to filter issues that are both closed and labeled with \"Regression\" and contain \"numpy.polynomial\" in the title or body.\n- **Automate the Scrolling Process**: Use WebSurfer to automate the scrolling and identification of the oldest issue.\n- **Extract the Date of Label Addition**: Once the oldest issue is identified, extract the date when the Regression label was added.\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Refine the search query to include \"numpy.polynomial\" and the \"Regression\" label.\n  - **Action**: Navigate to the numpy GitHub issues page and use the search bar to enter the query: `is:issue state:closed label:06 - Regression numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Step 2**: Sort the issues by oldest.\n  - **Action**: Click on the \"Sort\" button and select \"Oldest.\"\n- **Step 3**: Identify the oldest issue.\n  - **Action**: Scroll to the top of the list to find the oldest issue.\n- **Step 4**: Extract the date when the Regression label was added.\n  - **Action**: Open the issue and locate the timeline of events to find when the Regression label was added.\n- **Step 5**: Format the date in MM/DD/YY format.\n  - **Action**: Convert the date to the required format.\n- **Step 6**: Provide the final answer.\n  - **Action**: Report the date when the Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**: Ensure the search query is specific to \"numpy.polynomial\" and \"Regression\" to narrow down the results.\n- **Automate Scrolling**: Use WebSurfer to automatically scroll through the list and identify the oldest issue.\n- **Check the Timeline**: When opening the issue, check the timeline of events to find the exact date when the Regression label was added.\n\n### Example Commands for WebSurfer\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Navigate to the numpy GitHub issues page with the refined search query\nweb_surfer.navigate(\"https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aclosed+label%3A06+-+Regression+numpy.polynomial\")\n\n# Step 2: Sort the issues by oldest\nweb_surfer.click_element(\"//button[@aria-label='Sort']\")\nweb_surfer.click_element(\"//button[@role='menuitem'][text()='Oldest']\")\n\n# Step 3: Identify the oldest issue\nweb_surfer.scroll_to_top()\noldest_issue_url = web_surfer.get_element_attribute(\"//a[@class='Link--primary v-align-middle no-underline h4 js-navigation-open']\", \"href\")\n\n# Step 4: Extract the date when the Regression label was added\nweb_surfer.navigate(oldest_issue_url)\nregression_label_date = web_surfer.get_text(\"//relative-time[@class='no-wrap'][contains(@datetime, 'Regression')]\")\n\n# Step 5: Format the date in MM/DD/YY format\nfrom datetime import datetime\ndate_obj = datetime.strptime(regression_label_date, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')\nformatted_date = date_obj.strftime('%m/%d/%y')\n\n# Step 6: Provide the final answer\nprint(f\"The Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue on {formatted_date}.\")\n```\n\nThis plan should efficiently and accurately identify the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue with the Regression label and extract the date when the label was added."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress and insights gained so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when the Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The numpy repository on GitHub has a large number of issues, and we have filtered the issues to show only closed issues with the Regression label.\n   - The search query `is:issue state:closed label:Regression numpy.polynomial sort:created-asc` has been used to sort the issues by the oldest creation date.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when the Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - This information can be found on GitHub by navigating through the filtered issues and identifying the oldest issue related to numpy.polynomial.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which of the closed numpy.polynomial issues is the oldest among those labeled with Regression.\n   - Extracting the exact date when the Regression label was added to this issue.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Detailed Records**: The numpy project is well-maintained, so the issue tracking system is likely to have accurate and detailed records.\n   - **Potential Age of Issues**: The long history and widespread use of numpy indicate that there could be older issues with the Regression label, possibly dating back several years.\n   - **Scrolling Through Pages**: Since the issues are listed in reverse chronological order (newest first), the oldest issue with the Regression label is likely to be found deeper in the list, requiring us to scroll through multiple pages.\n   - **Significance of numpy.polynomial**: The numpy.polynomial module is an important part of the numpy library, so it is reasonable to expect that there are regression issues related to it, even if they are not the most recent ones.\n   - **Manual Browsing Required**: Given that the search query did not return any results initially, manual browsing through the closed issues is necessary to find the oldest issue related to numpy.polynomial with the Regression label.\n\n### REASONING FOR UPDATED EDUCATED GUESSES:\n- **Detailed Records**: The numpy project's well-maintained nature suggests that the issue tracking system will have accurate timestamps and labels, which will help in identifying the exact date when the Regression label was added.\n- **Potential Age of Issues**: The long history and widespread use of numpy indicate that there could be older issues with the Regression label, possibly dating back several years.\n- **Scrolling Through Pages**: Since the issues are listed in reverse chronological order (newest first), the oldest issue with the Regression label is likely to be found deeper in the list, requiring us to scroll through multiple pages.\n- **Significance of numpy.polynomial**: The numpy.polynomial module is an important part of the numpy library, so it is reasonable to expect that there are regression issues related to it, even if they are not the most recent ones.\n- **Manual Browsing Required**: The search query did not return any results, indicating that the relevant issues might not be easily filtered using the current query. Manual browsing is necessary to ensure we do not miss the oldest issue.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Continue Scrolling Through Issues**: Manually browse through the closed issues to find the oldest one related to numpy.polynomial with the Regression label.\n2. **Identify the Oldest Issue**: Once found, provide the URL of the issue.\n3. **Extract the Date of Label Addition**: Open the issue and locate the timeline of events to find when the Regression label was added.\n4. **Format the Date**: Convert the date to the required format (MM/DD/YY).\n5. **Provide the Final Answer**: Report the date when the Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue.\n\n### Example Commands for WebSurfer\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Navigate to the numpy GitHub issues page with the refined search query\nweb_surfer.navigate(\"https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression+numpy.polynomial+sort%3Acreated-asc\")\n\n# Step 2: Scroll through the issues to find the oldest one\nweb_surfer.scroll_to_bottom()\n\n# Step 3: Identify the oldest issue\noldest_issue_url = web_surfer.get_element_attribute(\"//a[@class='Link--primary v-align-middle no-underline h4 js-navigation-open']\", \"href\")\n\n# Step 4: Extract the date when the Regression label was added\nweb_surfer.navigate(oldest_issue_url)\nregression_label_date = web_surfer.get_text(\"//relative-time[@class='no-wrap'][contains(@datetime, 'Regression')]\")\n\n# Step 5: Format the date in MM/DD/YY format\nfrom datetime import datetime\ndate_obj = datetime.strptime(regression_label_date, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')\nformatted_date = date_obj.strftime('%m/%d/%y')\n\n# Step 6: Provide the final answer\nprint(f\"The Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue on {formatted_date}.\")\n```\n\nThis plan should efficiently and accurately identify the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue with the Regression label and extract the date when the label was added.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Ineffective Search Query**: The search query `is:issue state:closed label:Regression numpy.polynomial` did not return any results, possibly due to the specific combination of labels and keywords.\n- **Manual Browsing Required**: The search filters might not be sufficient to find the relevant issues, necessitating manual browsing through the closed issues.\n- **Sorting by Creation Date**: Sorting by creation date did not yield any results, suggesting that the relevant issues might not be easily sorted this way.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine the Search Query**:\n   - Use a broader search query to find closed issues with the Regression label, then manually filter for numpy.polynomial issues.\n   - **Action**: Navigate to the numpy GitHub issues page and use the search bar to enter the query: `is:issue state:closed label:Regression`.\n\n2. **Sort by Oldest**:\n   - Sort the issues by oldest creation date to start from the earliest issues.\n   - **Action**: Click on the \"Sort\" button and select \"Oldest.\"\n\n3. **Manual Browsing**:\n   - Manually browse through the issues to find the oldest one related to numpy.polynomial with the Regression label.\n   - **Action**: Scroll through the list of issues and look for issues with \"numpy.polynomial\" in the title or description.\n\n4. **Identify the Oldest Issue**:\n   - Once the oldest issue related to numpy.polynomial with the Regression label is found, provide the URL of the issue.\n   - **Action**: Click on the issue to open it and verify its details.\n\n5. **Extract the Date of Label Addition**:\n   - Open the issue and locate the timeline of events to find when the Regression label was added.\n   - **Action**: Look for the event that indicates the addition of the Regression label and note the date.\n\n6. **Format the Date**:\n   - Convert the date to the required format (MM/DD/YY).\n   - **Action**: Use Python to convert the date format.\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Report the date when the Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue.\n   - **Action**: Print the formatted date.\n\n### Example Commands for WebSurfer\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Navigate to the numpy GitHub issues page with the broader search query\nweb_surfer.navigate(\"https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression\")\n\n# Step 2: Sort the issues by oldest\nweb_surfer.click_element(\"//button[@aria-label='Sort']\")\nweb_surfer.click_element(\"//button[@role='menuitem'][text()='Oldest']\")\n\n# Step 3: Manually browse through the issues to find the oldest one related to numpy.polynomial\nweb_surfer.scroll_to_top()\nweb_surfer.scroll_to_bottom()  # Scroll through the list to find the relevant issue\n\n# Step 4: Identify the oldest issue\noldest_issue_url = None\nwhile oldest_issue_url is None:\n    issues = web_surfer.get_elements(\"//a[@class='Link--primary v-align-middle no-underline h4 js-navigation-open']\")\n    for issue in issues:\n        issue_title = web_surfer.get_text(issue)\n        if \"numpy.polynomial\" in issue_title.lower():\n            oldest_issue_url = web_surfer.get_attribute(issue, \"href\")\n            break\n    if oldest_issue_url is None:\n        web_surfer.scroll_to_bottom()  # Continue scrolling if not found\n\n# Step 5: Extract the date when the Regression label was added\nweb_surfer.navigate(oldest_issue_url)\nregression_label_date = web_surfer.get_text(\"//relative-time[@class='no-wrap'][contains(@datetime, 'Regression')]\")\n\n# Step 6: Format the date in MM/DD/YY format\nfrom datetime import datetime\ndate_obj = datetime.strptime(regression_label_date, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')\nformatted_date = date_obj.strftime('%m/%d/%y')\n\n# Step 7: Provide the final answer\nprint(f\"The Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue on {formatted_date}.\")\n```\n\nThis plan should help us efficiently and accurately identify the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue with the Regression label and extract the date when the label was added."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress and insights gained so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when the Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The numpy repository on GitHub has a large number of issues, and we have filtered the issues to show only closed issues with the Regression label.\n   - The search query `is:issue state:closed label:Regression sort:created-asc` has been used to sort the issues by the oldest creation date.\n   - The search query did not return any results initially, indicating that the relevant issues might not be easily filtered using the current query.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when the Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - This information can be found on GitHub by manually browsing through the closed issues and identifying the oldest issue related to numpy.polynomial with the Regression label.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which of the closed numpy.polynomial issues is the oldest among those labeled with Regression.\n   - Extracting the exact date when the Regression label was added to this issue.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Detailed Records**: The numpy project is well-maintained, so the issue tracking system is likely to have accurate and detailed records.\n   - **Potential Age of Issues**: The long history and widespread use of numpy indicate that there could be older issues with the Regression label, possibly dating back several years.\n   - **Manual Browsing Required**: Given that the search query did not return any results, manual browsing through the closed issues is necessary to find the oldest issue related to numpy.polynomial with the Regression label.\n   - **Significance of numpy.polynomial**: The numpy.polynomial module is an important part of the numpy library, so it is reasonable to expect that there are regression issues related to it, even if they are not the most recent ones.\n   - **Label Application Timing**: The Regression label might have been added at different times, so we need to carefully check the timeline of each issue to find the exact date when the label was added.\n\n### REASONING FOR UPDATED EDUCATED GUESSES:\n- **Detailed Records**: The numpy project's well-maintained nature suggests that the issue tracking system will have accurate timestamps and labels, which will help in identifying the exact date when the Regression label was added.\n- **Potential Age of Issues**: The long history and widespread use of numpy indicate that there could be older issues with the Regression label, possibly dating back several years.\n- **Manual Browsing Required**: The search query did not return any results, indicating that the relevant issues might not be easily filtered using the current query. Manual browsing is necessary to ensure we do not miss the oldest issue.\n- **Significance of numpy.polynomial**: The numpy.polynomial module is an important part of the numpy library, so it is reasonable to expect that there are regression issues related to it, even if they are not the most recent ones.\n- **Label Application Timing**: The Regression label might have been added at different times, so we need to carefully check the timeline of each issue to find the exact date when the label was added.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Continue Scrolling Through Issues**: Manually browse through the closed issues to find the oldest one related to numpy.polynomial with the Regression label.\n2. **Identify the Oldest Issue**: Once found, provide the URL of the issue.\n3. **Extract the Date of Label Addition**: Open the issue and locate the timeline of events to find when the Regression label was added.\n4. **Format the Date**: Convert the date to the required format (MM/DD/YY).\n5. **Provide the Final Answer**: Report the date when the Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue.\n\n### Example Commands for WebSurfer\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Navigate to the numpy GitHub issues page with the broader search query\nweb_surfer.navigate(\"https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression+sort%3Acreated-asc\")\n\n# Step 2: Scroll through the issues to find the oldest one related to numpy.polynomial\nweb_surfer.scroll_to_bottom()\n\n# Step 3: Identify the oldest issue\noldest_issue_url = None\nwhile oldest_issue_url is None:\n    issues = web_surfer.get_elements(\"//a[@class='Link--primary v-align-middle no-underline h4 js-navigation-open']\")\n    for issue in issues:\n        issue_title = web_surfer.get_text(issue)\n        if \"numpy.polynomial\" in issue_title.lower():\n            oldest_issue_url = web_surfer.get_attribute(issue, \"href\")\n            break\n    if oldest_issue_url is None:\n        web_surfer.scroll_to_bottom()  # Continue scrolling if not found\n\n# Step 4: Extract the date when the Regression label was added\nweb_surfer.navigate(oldest_issue_url)\nregression_label_date = web_surfer.get_text(\"//relative-time[@class='no-wrap'][contains(@datetime, 'Regression')]\")\n\n# Step 5: Format the date in MM/DD/YY format\nfrom datetime import datetime\ndate_obj = datetime.strptime(regression_label_date, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')\nformatted_date = date_obj.strftime('%m/%d/%y')\n\n# Step 6: Provide the final answer\nprint(f\"The Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue on {formatted_date}.\")\n```\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to find the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue with the Regression label and extract the date when the label was added. Please continue scrolling through the issues and look for the oldest one related to numpy.polynomial with the Regression label.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Ineffective Search Query**: The initial search query `is:issue state:closed label:Regression numpy.polynomial sort:created-asc` did not return any results, indicating that the specific combination of labels and keywords might not be present in the issues.\n- **Manual Browsing Required**: The search filters might not be sufficient to find the relevant issues, necessitating manual browsing through the closed issues.\n- **Sorting by Oldest**: Sorting by creation date did not yield any results, suggesting that the relevant issues might not be easily sorted this way.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine the Search Query**:\n   - Use a broader search query to find closed issues with the Regression label, then manually filter for numpy.polynomial issues.\n   - **Action**: Navigate to the numpy GitHub issues page and use the search bar to enter the query: `is:issue state:closed label:Regression`.\n\n2. **Sort by Oldest**:\n   - Sort the issues by oldest creation date to start from the earliest issues.\n   - **Action**: Click on the \"Sort\" button and select \"Oldest.\"\n\n3. **Manual Browsing**:\n   - Manually browse through the issues to find the oldest one related to numpy.polynomial with the Regression label.\n   - **Action**: Scroll through the list of issues and look for issues with \"numpy.polynomial\" in the title or description.\n\n4. **Identify the Oldest Issue**:\n   - Once the oldest issue related to numpy.polynomial with the Regression label is found, provide the URL of the issue.\n   - **Action**: Click on the issue to open it and verify its details.\n\n5. **Extract the Date of Label Addition**:\n   - Open the issue and locate the timeline of events to find when the Regression label was added.\n   - **Action**: Look for the event that indicates the addition of the Regression label and note the date.\n\n6. **Format the Date**:\n   - Convert the date to the required format (MM/DD/YY).\n   - **Action**: Use Python to convert the date format.\n\n7. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Report the date when the Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue.\n   - **Action**: Print the formatted date.\n\n### Example Commands for WebSurfer\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Navigate to the numpy GitHub issues page with the broader search query\nweb_surfer.navigate(\"https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aclosed+label%3ARegression\")\n\n# Step 2: Sort the issues by oldest\nweb_surfer.click_element(\"//button[@aria-label='Sort']\")\nweb_surfer.click_element(\"//button[@role='menuitem'][text()='Oldest']\")\n\n# Step 3: Manually browse through the issues to find the oldest one related to numpy.polynomial\nweb_surfer.scroll_to_top()\nweb_surfer.scroll_to_bottom()  # Scroll through the list to find the relevant issue\n\n# Step 4: Identify the oldest issue\noldest_issue_url = None\nwhile oldest_issue_url is None:\n    issues = web_surfer.get_elements(\"//a[@class='Link--primary v-align-middle no-underline h4 js-navigation-open']\")\n    for issue in issues:\n        issue_title = web_surfer.get_text(issue)\n        if \"numpy.polynomial\" in issue_title.lower():\n            oldest_issue_url = web_surfer.get_attribute(issue, \"href\")\n            break\n    if oldest_issue_url is None:\n        web_surfer.scroll_to_bottom()  # Continue scrolling if not found\n\n# Step 5: Extract the date when the Regression label was added\nweb_surfer.navigate(oldest_issue_url)\nregression_label_date = web_surfer.get_text(\"//relative-time[@class='no-wrap'][contains(@datetime, 'Regression')]\")\n\n# Step 6: Format the date in MM/DD/YY format\nfrom datetime import datetime\ndate_obj = datetime.strptime(regression_label_date, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')\nformatted_date = date_obj.strftime('%m/%d/%y')\n\n# Step 7: Provide the final answer\nprint(f\"The Regression label was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue on {formatted_date}.\")\n```\n\n### Additional Hints\n\n- **Check for Multiple Pages**: If the relevant issue is not found on the first page, continue scrolling through multiple pages.\n- **Verify Issue Details**: Ensure that the issue is indeed related to numpy.polynomial and has the Regression label.\n- **Be Patient**: Some pages might take longer to load, especially if they contain many issues. Allow sufficient time for the page to fully load before scrolling or clicking.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps to find the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue with the Regression label and extract the date when the label was added."}
