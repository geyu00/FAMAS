Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - We need to find the number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for this game before the month listed as the game's release date.\n   - The Wikipedia page should be checked as of the most recent entry from 2022.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of the game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The release date of the game as listed on its Wikipedia page.\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for the game before the month of its release date.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the specified month can be derived by examining the revision history of the page up to the month before the game's release date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019 is likely a well-known and critically acclaimed title.\n   - The release date of the game is probably well-documented on its Wikipedia page.\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page is likely to be substantial, given that it is a popular game.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for the name of the game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n- **Step 2:** Once the game's name is identified, use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page for that game.\n- **Step 3:** On the Wikipedia page, locate the release date of the game.\n- **Step 4:** Use WebSurfer to navigate to the \"View history\" page of the Wikipedia article.\n- **Step 5:** Use WebSurfer to count the number of revisions made before the month of the game's release date.\n- **Step 6:** Verify the final count and report back with the result."}

The game was released worldwide for the \nPlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a \nWindows port released in January 2022. It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are basically 2 protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and \ngods of the Norse world.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"God of War (2018 video game)\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2016-06-14T19:06:41Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-16T13:09:35Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"headline\": \"2018 action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by Santa Monica Studio\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"853\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"God of War (2018 video game) - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and \ngods of the Norse world. \nDescribed by creative director \nCory Barlog as a reimagining of the franchise, a major \ngameplay change is that Kratos makes prominent use of a magical \nbattle axe known as the Leviathan Axe instead of his signature \ndouble-chained blades called the Blades of Chaos. The game also uses an \nover-the-shoulder free camera, with the game in \none shot, as opposed to the \nfixed cinematic camera of the previous entries. It also includes \nrole-playing game elements, and Kratos's son Atreus provides assistance in combat. The majority of the original game's development team worked on \nGod of War and designed it to be accessible and grounded. A separate short \ntext-based game, \nA Call from the Wilds, was released in February 2018 through \nFacebook Messenger and follows Atreus on his first adventure. Three days before \nGod of War's release, a smartphone companion app called \nMímir's Vision was made available, providing additional information about the game's Norse setting. \nGod of War received universal acclaim from critics for its story, world design, art direction, music, graphics, combat system, and characters, in particular the dynamic between Kratos and Atreus. Many reviewers felt it had successfully revitalized the series without losing the core identity of its predecessors. It was named \nGame of the Year by numerous media outlets and award shows, and has been cited as among the \ngreatest video games ever made. The game also performed well commercially, selling over 5 million units within a month of its release and 23 million units sold by November 2022, making it one of the \nbest-selling PlayStation 4 games and the best-selling game in the series. A \nnovelization was released in August 2018, followed by \na prequel comic series published from November 2018 to June 2021, while a \nlive-action television series is in development for \nAmazon Prime Video. A sequel, \nGod of War Ragnarök, was released for the PlayStation 4 and \nPlayStation 5 in November 2022, and for Windows in 2024. \nGameplay[edit]God of War is a \nthird-person \naction-adventure video game. It features an \nover-the-shoulder free camera (a departure from the previous installments which featured a \nfixed cinematic camera, with the exception of 2007's \ntwo-dimensional \nside-scrollerBetrayal).\n[7] Cinematographically, the game is presented in a \ncontinuous shot, with no \ncamera cuts or \nloading screens.\n[8] Although the previous main installment, \nAscension (2013), introduced \nmultiplayer to the series, this installment is \nsingle-player-only.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Carson, who had voiced Kratos since the \noriginal 2005 game and also did the \nmotion capture for him in 2013's \nAscension.\nDuring early development, there was talk of having a different protagonist for the game. Some of the team said that Kratos was \"annoying\" and felt Kratos's story had run its course. Barlog said it took a lot of convincing to keep Kratos.\n[49] Referencing the \nNintendo character \nMario and the \nMario games, Barlog said that like Mario, \"Kratos is intrinsically tied\" to the \nGod of War series.\n[20] In regard to the new changes, Barlog said that:\nI knew I didn't want to simply \nreboot the \nfranchise, starting over with a retelling of the \norigin story. I wanted to reimagine the gameplay, give players a fresh perspective and a new tactile experience while delving deeper into the emotional journey of \nKratos to explore the compelling drama that unfolds when an immortal demigod makes a decision to change.\n[53]Barlog explained that Kratos had to change his cycle of violence and learn to control his rage. He said Kratos had made many bad decisions, which led to the destruction of \nOlympus. He wanted to know what would happen if Kratos made a good decision. The birth of Barlog's own son influenced the idea of Kratos's character change.\n[50] The canceled live-action \nStar Wars television series developed by \nGeorge Lucas during the 2000s was also an influence; back on his days working at \nLucasArts, Barlog had been allowed to visit \nSkywalker Ranch and read some scripts written by writers of \nThe Shield and \n24 planned for the show, particularly starring \nEmperor Palpatine in an emotional and sympathetic \norigin story that depicted his fall into villainy after being wronged by a heartless woman.\n[51] The bond between Kratos and his son is at the heart of the game. Barlog said, \"This game is about Kratos teaching his son how to be a god, and his son teaching Kratos how to be human again\".\n[16] Referencing the \nMarvel Comics character \nHulk, Barlog said that in regards to Kratos, \"We've already told the story of The Hulk. We want to tell the story of [Bruce] Banner now\".\n[16] One of their goals was to make Kratos \"a more nuanced and interesting character\".\n[52] In changing the narrative focus, Studstill said, \"I think we inherently knew the franchise needed to evolve in that emotional beat and be something meatier for the older generation of gamers\".\n[52]Christopher Judge, best known as \nTeal'c from \nStargate SG-1, replaced \nTerrence C. Carson as the voice of Kratos; Carson had voiced Kratos since the original \nGod of War game. Commenting on the change, Carson said, \"Sony went in a new direction\".\n[53] Carson later explained that he understood the reason for the actor change and that Judge's casting made sense for what Sony was wanting to do. He also said that losing acting jobs is part of the business, but he did feel a lack of respect as he was not contacted by anyone at Sony to be informed of the change.\n[54]In explaining the actor change, Barlog said that the way the previous games were made, they were able to have someone else do the \nmotion capture instead of the voice actor. Although Carson had done the motion capture for Kratos in \nAscension, Barlog said the actor change was made because of the type of camera work they wanted to do. For the new camera work, they needed someone who was closer to Kratos's size to do the motion capture along with a child. Carson was unsuitable for this because he was much shorter than Kratos, who is over \n6 feet (180 cm) tall: \"Offsetting [Carson's height] for the size of a child, it turned out it was going to be almost impossible to try and actually shoot them and go in and redo the animations\".\n[55] Judge was chosen because he was \n6 feet 3 inches (191 cm) and had the build of a professional football player. He was also chosen because of the chemistry with his then-10-year-old co-star Sunny Suljic, whose opinion was also sought in making the decision; out of all the auditions, he liked Judge the most. The two bonded well, and Judge described his time with Suljic as time he had missed with his own children. In stepping into the role of Kratos, Judge took it as an opportunity to add something new to the character. He researched the character and Carson's performance but decided not to imitate it. Since Santa Monica was going in a new direction, he decided to start fresh. Judge was thrown off when he first read the script, saying it \"was a real script,\" and not just \"a way to get into battles,\" which is why he decided to take the role.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019 is **God of War**.\n   - The release date of God of War, as listed on its Wikipedia page, is **April 20, 2018**.\n   - We need to find the number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for God of War before April 2018.\n   - The Wikipedia page should be checked as of the most recent entry from 2022.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for God of War before April 2018.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before April 2018 can be derived by examining the revision history of the page up to the month before the game's release date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that God of War is a highly anticipated and critically acclaimed title, the number of revisions on its Wikipedia page before its release is likely to be substantial.\n   - The revision history of popular game pages is often very active, especially in the months leading up to the release date, as the community and editors frequently update the page with new information, trailers, and details.\n   - The number of revisions might be in the hundreds, considering the high level of interest and the frequent updates that occur for such a significant game.\n\n### Updated Plan\n1. **Step 1:** Navigate to the 'View history' page of the God of War Wikipedia article.\n2. **Step 2:** Count the number of revisions made before April 2018.\n3. **Step 3:** Verify the final count and report back with the result.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step. Navigate to the 'View history' page of the God of War Wikipedia article and count the number of revisions made before April 2018.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: The previous attempts to navigate to the 'View history' page of the God of War Wikipedia article were unsuccessful. Instead of directly accessing the 'View history' page, the web surfer navigated to the 'Edit' page or encountered errors due to IP blocking.\n- **IP Blocking**: The IP address used by the web surfer was globally blocked, preventing any editing actions. This also interfered with the ability to navigate to certain pages.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Directly Navigate to the 'View History' Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Wikipedia page for God of War.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'View history' link directly from the God of War Wikipedia page.\n\n2. **Count Revisions Before April 2018**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the revision history to count the number of revisions made before April 2018.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the viewport is adjusted to see the revision dates clearly.\n\n3. **Verify and Report**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm the final count of revisions.\n   - **Assistant**: Report the final count back to the user.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n- **Step 1**: Open the Wikipedia page for God of War.\n- **Step 2**: Click on the 'View history' link.\n- **Step 3**: Scroll through the revision history and count the number of revisions made before April 2018.\n- **Step 4**: Verify the count and report back.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Prior Challenges\n- **Avoid Editing Actions**: Do not attempt to edit the page or access the 'Edit' page, as this can trigger IP blocking.\n- **Direct Link**: Use the direct link to the 'View history' page if available.\n- **Scroll Carefully**: Ensure the viewport is adjusted to clearly see the revision dates and avoid missing any revisions.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. Navigate to the 'View history' page of the God of War Wikipedia article and count the number of revisions made before April 2018."}

First released for the \nPlayStation 2 on March 22, 2005, the game is the first installment in the \nGod of War series and the third chronologically. Loosely based on \nGreek mythology, it is set in \nancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist \nKratos, a \nSpartan warrior who serves the \nOlympian gods. The goddess \nAthena tasks Kratos with killing \nAres, the God of War and Kratos' former mentor who tricked Kratos into killing his wife and daughter. As Ares besieges \nAthens out of hatred for Athena, Kratos embarks on a quest to find the one object capable of stopping the god once and for all: \nPandora's Box. \nThe \ngameplay of \nGod of War focuses on \ncombo-based combat, achieved through the player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and a secondary weapon acquired later in the game. It features \nquick time events that require the player to complete various game controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and \nbosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options.

For other uses, see \nPandora's box (disambiguation).\nLawrence Alma-Tadema's water-colour of an ambivalent Pandora, 1881\nPandora's box is an artifact in \nGreek mythology connected with the myth of \nPandora in \nHesiod's c. 700 B.C. poem \nWorks and Days.\n[1] Hesiod related that curiosity led her to open a \ncontainer left in the care of her husband, thus releasing \ncurses upon mankind. Later depictions of the story have been varied, with some literary and artistic treatments focusing more on the contents than on Pandora herself. \nThe container mentioned in the original account was actually a large storage \njar, but the word was later mistranslated. In modern times an idiom has grown from the story meaning \"Any source of great and unexpected troubles\",\n[2] or alternatively \"A present which seems valuable but which in reality is a curse\".\n[3]In mythology[edit]Main article: \nPandora\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Pandora's box\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_box\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q937164\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q937164\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2002-11-25T20:14:48Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-08T06:07:41Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Lawrence_Alma-Tadema_10.jpeg\",\n        \"headline\": \"mythic artifact\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Lawrence_Alma-Tadema_10.jpeg/960px-Lawrence_Alma-Tadema_10.jpeg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"691\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Pandora's box - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019 is **God of War**.\n   - The release date of God of War, as listed on its Wikipedia page, is **April 20, 2018**.\n   - We need to find the number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for God of War before April 2018.\n   - The Wikipedia page should be checked as of the most recent entry from 2022.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for God of War before April 2018.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before April 2018 can be derived by examining the revision history of the page up to the month before the game's release date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that God of War is a highly anticipated and critically acclaimed title, the number of revisions on its Wikipedia page before its release is likely to be substantial.\n   - The revision history of popular game pages is often very active, especially in the months leading up to the release date, as the community and editors frequently update the page with new information, trailers, and details.\n   - The number of revisions might be in the hundreds, considering the high level of interest and the frequent updates that occur for such a significant game.\n   - **New Guess**: The Wikipedia page for God of War (2018) likely had a significant increase in revisions in the months immediately preceding the release date, as anticipation and new information would have driven more frequent updates.\n\n### Updated Plan\n1. **Step 1:** Navigate to the 'View history' page of the God of War (2018 video game) Wikipedia article.\n2. **Step 2:** Count the number of revisions made before April 2018.\n3. **Step 3:** Verify the final count and report back with the result.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n- **Step 1**: Open the Wikipedia page for God of War (2018 video game).\n- **Step 2**: Click on the 'View history' link.\n- **Step 3**: Scroll through the revision history and count the number of revisions made before April 2018.\n- **Step 4**: Verify the count and report back.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step. Navigate to the Wikipedia page for God of War (2018 video game) and then click on the 'View history' link.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: The web surfer navigated to the wrong Wikipedia page multiple times, specifically to the God of War (2005 video game) and Pandora's box pages instead of the God of War (2018 video game) page.\n- **Lack of Verification**: There was no verification step to ensure the correct page was opened before proceeding to the 'View history' page.\n- **Manual Errors**: The web surfer may have clicked on incorrect links due to the lack of clear instructions or verification.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Wikipedia Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"God of War (2018 video game) Wikipedia\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify that the correct page is open by checking the title and release date (April 20, 2018).\n\n2. **Access the 'View History' Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'View history' link on the God of War (2018 video game) Wikipedia page.\n\n3. **Count Revisions Before April 2018**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the revision history and count the number of revisions made before April 2018.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the viewport is adjusted to clearly see the revision dates and avoid missing any revisions.\n\n4. **Verify and Report**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm the final count of revisions.\n   - **Assistant**: Report the final count back to the user.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n- **Step 1**: Perform a web search for \"God of War (2018 video game) Wikipedia\".\n- **Step 2**: Verify that the correct page is open by checking the title and release date (April 20, 2018).\n- **Step 3**: Click on the 'View history' link.\n- **Step 4**: Scroll through the revision history and count the number of revisions made before April 2018.\n- **Step 5**: Verify the count and report back.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Prior Challenges\n- **Verification Step**: Always verify the page title and release date before proceeding to the 'View history' page.\n- **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear instructions to click on specific links and verify the page content.\n- **Careful Navigation**: Adjust the viewport to clearly see the revision dates and avoid missing any revisions.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan.
