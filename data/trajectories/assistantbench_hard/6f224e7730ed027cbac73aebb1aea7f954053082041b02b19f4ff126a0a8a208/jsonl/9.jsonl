{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich members of Fubo's Management Team joined the company during the same year Fubo's IPO happened?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO (Initial Public Offering).\n   - The request asks about members of Fubo's Management Team who joined the company in the same year as the IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year Fubo went public (IPO year).\n   - The names and joining years of the current members of Fubo's Management Team.\n   - These details can be found on Fubo's official website, SEC filings, press releases, and possibly company profiles on business news websites like Bloomberg, Forbes, or Reuters.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the joining years of the management team members with the year of Fubo's IPO to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Fubo's IPO likely occurred within the last few years, given the recent trend of tech and media companies going public.\n   - Key management positions such as CEO, CFO, and COO are likely to have been filled around the time of the IPO, but this is a guess and needs verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Year of Fubo's IPO:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search to find the exact year Fubo went public (IPO year).\n\n- **Gather Information on Fubo's Management Team:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Visit Fubo's official website and navigate to the section detailing the management team. Collect the names and joining years of the management team members.\n\n- **Cross-Reference Joining Years with IPO Year:**\n  - **Assistant:** Compare the joining years of the management team members with the IPO year to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n- **Compile and Present the Results:**\n  - **Assistant:** Summarize the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined Fubo in the same year as the IPO."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich members of Fubo's Management Team joined the company during the same year Fubo's IPO happened?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and refined educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO (Initial Public Offering) in 2020.\n   - The request asks about members of Fubo's Management Team who joined the company in the same year as the IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The names and joining years of the current members of Fubo's Management Team.\n   - These details can be found on Fubo's official website, SEC filings, press releases, and possibly company profiles on business news websites like Bloomberg, Forbes, or Reuters.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the joining years of the management team members with the year 2020 to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that Fubo's IPO was in 2020, it is likely that key management positions such as CEO, CFO, and COO were either already in place or were brought in to support the company's transition to a public entity.\n   - The management team might have undergone significant changes around the time of the IPO to ensure the company was well-prepared for the public market.\n   - It is also possible that some mid-level executives or specialized roles were added to strengthen the company's operational and strategic capabilities.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Key Management Positions**: Companies often ensure that their leadership is stable and experienced before going public. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that key roles like CEO, CFO, and COO were either already in place or were brought in shortly before the IPO.\n- **Operational and Strategic Roles**: To support the growth and stability required for a public company, Fubo might have added or promoted individuals to specialized roles in finance, operations, and strategy.\n- **Public Market Readiness**: The year leading up to an IPO is typically a period of significant preparation, which often includes bringing in new talent to manage the increased scrutiny and responsibilities that come with being a public company.\n\nNext Steps:\n- **WebSurfer:** Visit Fubo's official website and navigate to the section detailing the management team. Collect the names and joining years of the management team members.\n- **Cross-Reference:** Compare the joining years of the management team members with 2020 to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The web surfer navigated to sections of the website that did not contain the required information about the management team. For example, navigating to the accessibility statement and news sections instead of the 'About Us' or 'Management Team' sections.\n2. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided to the web surfer were too broad, leading to navigation to irrelevant pages.\n3. **Inefficient Use of Resources**: The focus was on navigating the website without a clear plan to find the specific information needed.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Identify the Correct Section**:\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate directly to the 'About Us' section of Fubo's official website. If there is a dedicated 'Management Team' or 'Leadership' section, go there specifically.\n   \n2. **Collect Management Team Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer:** Once on the correct page, scroll through the content to find the list of management team members. Collect the names and joining years of each member.\n   \n3. **Cross-Reference with IPO Year**:\n   - **Assistant:** Compare the joining years of the management team members with the year 2020 (the year of Fubo's IPO) to identify those who joined in the same year.\n   \n4. **Summarize and Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant:** Compile the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined Fubo in 2020.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - Navigate to Fubo's official website: `https://www.fubo.tv`.\n  - Click on the 'About Us' link in the footer or header.\n  - If there is a dedicated 'Management Team' or 'Leadership' section, click on it.\n  - Scroll through the page to find the list of management team members.\n  - Collect the names and joining years of each member.\n\n- **Assistant:**\n  - Cross-reference the collected joining years with the year 2020.\n  - Compile the names of the management team members who joined in 2020.\n  - Present the final list of names.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - Look for specific keywords like \"Management Team,\" \"Leadership,\" or \"Executive Team\" to find the relevant section.\n  - If the information is not on the main 'About Us' page, check sub-pages or use the website's search function to find the management team section.\n  - Ensure that the page is fully loaded before scrolling or clicking to avoid missing any content.\n\n- **Assistant:**\n  - Double-check the collected data for accuracy and completeness.\n  - Ensure that the cross-referencing process is thorough and accurate.\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to efficiently locate and collect the required information about Fubo's management team and identify those who joined in 2020."}

Established in 1968 as an expansion franchise, the Suns quickly became a prominent force in the National Basketball Association (NBA). With a rich historical background, the team has achieved numerous milestones and boasts an impressive track record. Throughout their existence, the Suns have showcased a dedication to excellence, earning multiple playoff berths and making it to the NBA Finals on two occasions. Led by legendary players such as Charles Barkley, Steve Nash, and Amar'e Stoudemire, the Suns have consistently been a competitive force in the league. Known for their fast-paced style of play, the Suns have implemented an up-tempo offense, utilizing quick transitions and three-point shooting to dominate their opponents. This offensive strategy, coined \"Seven Seconds or Less,\" was popularized during the early 2000s and exemplified the Suns' exciting brand of basketball. Over the years, the Suns have experienced notable rivalries with teams like the Los Angeles Lakers and the San Antonio Spurs. These matchups often led to intense and memorable contests that captivated basketball fans worldwide. The rivalry with the Lakers, in particular, has been highly publicized due to numerous playoff battles between the two franchises. In terms of statistical achievements, the Suns have had several standout players who have etched their names in the record books. From scoring records set by Tom Chambers and Kevin Johnson to the exceptional three-point shooting prowess of Dan Majerle and Devin Booker, the Suns' players have demonstrated remarkable individual abilities over the years. The Suns also have a loyal and passionate fan base who support the team fervently. Home games at the Talking Stick Resort Arena (formerly known as the US Airways Center) have become renowned for their energetic atmosphere and enthusiastic crowds. Overall, the Phoenix Suns have left an indelible mark on the NBA landscape. With a foundation built on exciting playstyles, unforgettable rivalries, and individual accomplishments, this franchise has carved out a significant place in basketball history.\nRead More +\nHow to watch Phoenix Suns without cable TV\nStart your Fubo free trial\nGet access to your favorite live sports and shows on demand\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": [\n        \"{\\\"@context\\\":\\\"https://schema.org\\\",\\\"@type\\\":\\\"SportsTeam\\\",\\\"sport\\\":\\\"Basketball\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Phoenix Suns\\\",\\\"logo\\\":\\\"https://gn-imgx.fubo.tv/assets/t422_l_h15_ac.png\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/team/422\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"https://imgx.fubo.tv/sports_logos/basketball_sport_type.png\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"The Phoenix Suns are a professional basketball team based in Phoenix, Arizona.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich members of Fubo's Management Team joined the company during the same year Fubo's IPO happened?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and refined educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO (Initial Public Offering) in 2020.\n   - The request asks about members of Fubo's Management Team who joined the company in the same year as the IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The names and joining years of the current members of Fubo's Management Team.\n   - These details can be found on Fubo's official website, SEC filings, press releases, and possibly company profiles on business news websites like Bloomberg, Forbes, or Reuters.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the joining years of the management team members with the year 2020 to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that Fubo's IPO was in 2020, it is likely that key management positions such as CEO, CFO, and COO were either already in place or were brought in to support the company's transition to a public entity.\n   - The management team might have undergone significant changes around the time of the IPO to ensure the company was well-prepared for the public market.\n   - It is also possible that some mid-level executives or specialized roles were added to strengthen the company's operational and strategic capabilities.\n   - **New Guess**: Since the 'About Us' page on Fubo's official website did not provide the necessary information, it is possible that the management team details are more prominently featured in SEC filings or recent press releases related to the IPO. This is because companies often disclose such information in regulatory documents to provide transparency to investors.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Key Management Positions**: Companies often ensure that their leadership is stable and experienced before going public. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that key roles like CEO, CFO, and COO were either already in place or were brought in shortly before the IPO.\n- **Operational and Strategic Roles**: To support the growth and stability required for a public company, Fubo might have added or promoted individuals to specialized roles in finance, operations, and strategy.\n- **Public Market Readiness**: The year leading up to an IPO is typically a period of significant preparation, which often includes bringing in new talent to manage the increased scrutiny and responsibilities that come with being a public company.\n- **SEC Filings and Press Releases**: These documents are crucial for providing detailed information about the company's management structure and changes, especially around the time of an IPO. They are designed to offer transparency to potential investors and regulatory bodies.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **WebSurfer:**\n   - Visit Fubo's official website again and navigate to the 'Investors' section or any relevant SEC filings.\n   - Search for press releases from 2020 that might mention new hires or management changes.\n   - Collect the names and joining years of the management team members from these sources.\n\n2. **Cross-Reference:**\n   - Compare the joining years of the management team members with the year 2020 to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n3. **Summarize and Present the Results:**\n   - Compile the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined Fubo in 2020.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - Navigate to Fubo's official website: https://www.fubo.tv.\n  - Click on the 'Investors' link in the footer or header.\n  - If there is a dedicated 'Management Team' or 'Leadership' section, click on it.\n  - Scroll through the page to find the list of management team members.\n  - If the information is not available on the website, visit Fubo's SEC filings page or search for press releases from 2020.\n  - Collect the names and joining years of each member.\n\n- **Assistant:**\n  - Cross-reference the collected joining years with the year 2020.\n  - Compile the names of the management team members who joined in 2020.\n  - Present the final list of names.\n\nBy following this updated plan, we should be able to efficiently locate and collect the required information about Fubo's management team and identify those who joined in 2020.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The web surfer navigated to sections of the website that did not contain the required information about the management team. For example, navigating to the 'Careers' page, 'Phoenix Suns' page, and 'Fubo News' page instead of the 'About Us' or 'Management Team' sections.\n2. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided to the web surfer were too broad, leading to navigation to irrelevant pages.\n3. **Inefficient Use of Resources**: The focus was on navigating the website without a clear plan to find the specific information needed.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to the 'About Us' Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer:** Go to Fubo's official website: https://www.fubo.tv.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Click on the 'About Us' link in the footer or header.\n\n2. **Locate the Management Team Section**:\n   - **WebSurfer:** Once on the 'About Us' page, look for a dedicated 'Management Team' or 'Leadership' section. If not immediately visible, use the website's search function or navigate through sub-pages.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Scroll through the page to find the list of management team members.\n\n3. **Collect Management Team Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer:** Collect the names and joining years of each management team member.\n   - **WebSurfer:** If the joining years are not explicitly stated, look for press releases or SEC filings from 2020 for additional information.\n\n4. **Cross-Reference with IPO Year**:\n   - **Assistant:** Compare the collected joining years with the year 2020 to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n5. **Summarize and Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant:** Compile the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined Fubo in 2020.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - Navigate to Fubo's official website: https://www.fubo.tv.\n  - Click on the 'About Us' link in the footer or header.\n  - Look for a dedicated 'Management Team' or 'Leadership' section. If not immediately visible, use the website's search function or navigate through sub-pages.\n  - Scroll through the page to find the list of management team members.\n  - Collect the names and joining years of each management team member.\n  - If the joining years are not explicitly stated, search for press releases or SEC filings from 2020 for additional information.\n\n- **Assistant:**\n  - Cross-reference the collected joining years with the year 2020.\n  - Compile the names of the management team members who joined in 2020.\n  - Present the final list of names.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - Look for specific keywords like \"Management Team,\" \"Leadership,\" or \"Executive Team\" to find the relevant section.\n  - If the information is not on the main 'About Us' page, check sub-pages or use the website's search function to find the management team section.\n  - Ensure that the page is fully loaded before scrolling or clicking to avoid missing any content.\n\n- **Assistant:**\n  - Double-check the collected data for accuracy and completeness.\n  - Ensure that the cross-referencing process is thorough and accurate.\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to efficiently locate and collect the required information about Fubo's management team and identify those who joined in 2020."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich members of Fubo's Management Team joined the company during the same year Fubo's IPO happened?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and refined educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO (Initial Public Offering) in 2020.\n   - The request asks about members of Fubo's Management Team who joined the company in the same year as the IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The names and joining years of the current members of Fubo's Management Team.\n   - These details can be found on Fubo's official website, SEC filings, press releases, and possibly company profiles on business news websites like Bloomberg, Forbes, or Reuters.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the joining years of the management team members with the year 2020 to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given that Fubo's IPO was in 2020, it is likely that key management positions such as CEO, CFO, and COO were either already in place or were brought in to support the company's transition to a public entity.\n   - The management team might have undergone significant changes around the time of the IPO to ensure the company was well-prepared for the public market.\n   - It is also possible that some mid-level executives or specialized roles were added to strengthen the company's operational and strategic capabilities.\n   - **Updated Guess**: Since the 'About Us' page on Fubo's official website did not provide the necessary information, it is highly likely that the management team details are more prominently featured in SEC filings or recent press releases related to the IPO. This is because companies often disclose such information in regulatory documents to provide transparency to investors and regulatory bodies.\n   - **New Guess**: The 'Investors' section of Fubo's website may have a dedicated page or section for corporate governance, which could include detailed information about the management team and their joining dates.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Key Management Positions**: Companies often ensure that their leadership is stable and experienced before going public. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that key roles like CEO, CFO, and COO were either already in place or were brought in shortly before the IPO.\n- **Operational and Strategic Roles**: To support the growth and stability required for a public company, Fubo might have added or promoted individuals to specialized roles in finance, operations, and strategy.\n- **Public Market Readiness**: The year leading up to an IPO is typically a period of significant preparation, which often includes bringing in new talent to manage the increased scrutiny and responsibilities that come with being a public company.\n- **SEC Filings and Press Releases**: These documents are crucial for providing detailed information about the company's management structure and changes, especially around the time of an IPO. They are designed to offer transparency to potential investors and regulatory bodies.\n- **Investors Section**: The 'Investors' section of a company's website is a common place to find detailed corporate governance information, including the management team and their joining dates.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **WebSurfer:**\n   - Visit Fubo's official website: https://www.fubo.tv.\n   - Click on the 'Investors' link in the footer or header.\n   - Look for a dedicated 'Corporate Governance' or 'Management Team' section within the 'Investors' page.\n   - If the information is not available on the website, visit Fubo's SEC filings page or search for press releases from 2020.\n   - Collect the names and joining years of the management team members from these sources.\n\n2. **Cross-Reference:**\n   - Compare the joining years of the management team members with the year 2020 to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n3. **Summarize and Present the Results:**\n   - Compile the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined Fubo in 2020.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - Navigate to Fubo's official website: https://www.fubo.tv.\n  - Click on the 'Investors' link in the footer or header.\n  - Look for a dedicated 'Corporate Governance' or 'Management Team' section within the 'Investors' page.\n  - If not found, visit Fubo's SEC filings page or search for press releases from 2020.\n  - Collect the names and joining years of each member.\n\n- **Assistant:**\n  - Cross-reference the collected joining years with the year 2020.\n  - Compile the names of the management team members who joined in 2020.\n  - Present the final list of names.\n\nBy following this updated plan, we should be able to efficiently locate and collect the required information about Fubo's management team and identify those who joined in 2020.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The web surfer navigated to irrelevant pages such as the 'Fubo vs. DirecTV' comparison page instead of the 'About Us' or 'Investors' section.\n2. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided were too broad, leading to navigation to incorrect sections of the website.\n3. **Inefficient Use of Resources**: The focus was on navigating the website without a clear plan to find the specific information needed.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to the 'Investors' Section**:\n   - **WebSurfer:** Go to Fubo's official website: https://www.fubo.tv.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Click on the 'Investors' link in the footer or header.\n\n2. **Locate the Corporate Governance or Management Team Section**:\n   - **WebSurfer:** Once on the 'Investors' page, look for a dedicated 'Corporate Governance' or 'Management Team' section.\n   - **WebSurfer:** If not immediately visible, use the website's search function or navigate through sub-pages.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Scroll through the page to find the list of management team members.\n\n3. **Collect Management Team Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer:** Collect the names and joining years of each management team member.\n   - **WebSurfer:** If the joining years are not explicitly stated, look for press releases or SEC filings from 2020 for additional information.\n\n4. **Cross-Reference with IPO Year**:\n   - **Assistant:** Compare the collected joining years with the year 2020 to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n5. **Summarize and Present the Results**:\n   - **Assistant:** Compile the findings and present the names of the management team members who joined Fubo in 2020.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - Navigate to Fubo's official website: https://www.fubo.tv.\n  - Click on the 'Investors' link in the footer or header.\n  - Look for a dedicated 'Corporate Governance' or 'Management Team' section within the 'Investors' page.\n  - If not found, use the website's search function or navigate through sub-pages.\n  - Scroll through the page to find the list of management team members.\n  - Collect the names and joining years of each member.\n  - If the joining years are not explicitly stated, search for press releases or SEC filings from 2020 for additional information.\n\n- **Assistant:**\n  - Cross-reference the collected joining years with the year 2020.\n  - Compile the names of the management team members who joined in 2020.\n  - Present the final list of names.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - Look for specific keywords like \"Management Team,\" \"Leadership,\" \"Corporate Governance,\" or \"Executive Team\" to find the relevant section.\n  - If the information is not on the main 'Investors' page, check sub-pages or use the website's search function.\n  - Ensure that the page is fully loaded before scrolling or clicking to avoid missing any content.\n\n- **Assistant:**\n  - Double-check the collected data for accuracy and completeness.\n  - Ensure that the cross-referencing process is thorough and accurate.\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to efficiently locate and collect the required information about Fubo's management team and identify those who joined in 2020."}
