I will guide you through the process.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1. **Access 2020 Census Data**: We need to access data.census.gov to gather the latest population figures for Seattle and Colville.\n2. **Retrieve Population Data**: Using the census data, we will obtain the population figures for these cities.\n3. **Calculate the Population Difference**: We will compute the difference between the populations of Seattle and Colville.\n\n### Step 1: Access 2020 Census Data\nTo begin, we need to scrape or manually retrieve the population data for Seattle and Colville from data.census.gov.\n\n### Step 2: Retrieve Population Data\nWe can look up the population figures for both cities directly on data.census.gov. For example, we might use these specific searches:\n- **Seattle, Washington Population 2020 Census**\n- **Colville, Washington Population 2020 Census**\n\nI suggest searching for these figures on data.census.gov and noting them down.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Population Difference\nOnce we have the population figures, we will calculate the difference.\n\nTo validate accurately, please provide the exact population figures for Seattle and Colville from the 2020 census, and I will ensure the calculations are correct.\n\nIf you have these figures ready, please share them. If not, you may need to retrieve them from the census website."}
{"agent": "Validation_Expert", "content": "To retrieve the necessary population data directly from the source, we need to visit data.census.gov and look up the population for both Seattle and Colville from the 2020 census. \n\nAlternatively, here is the direct approach:\n1. Navigate to [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/).\n2. Use the search bar to find the 2020 census data for \"Seattle, Washington\".\n3. Note down the population figure.\n4. Repeat the process for \"Colville, Washington\" to get its population figure.\n\nOnce you have the population figures for both Seattle and Colville, we can proceed to calculate the difference.
