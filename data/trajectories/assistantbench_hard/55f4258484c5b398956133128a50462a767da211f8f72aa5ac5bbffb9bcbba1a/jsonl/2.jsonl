Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series must be rated on Rotten Tomatoes.\n   - The goal is to find the worst-rated series according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of all series starring Ted Danson.\n   - The number of seasons for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - The availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Specific sources:\n     - IMDb for a comprehensive list of Ted Danson's TV appearances.\n     - Amazon Prime Video (US) website or app for availability.\n     - Rotten Tomatoes for ratings.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Filter the list of series to only those with more than 1 season.\n   - Filter the list to only those available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Identify the worst-rated series from the filtered list based on Rotten Tomatoes scores.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Ted Danson has starred in several well-known series, such as \"Cheers,\" \"The Good Place,\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" but these are likely not the worst-rated.\n   - Some of his lesser-known or more recent series might be candidates for the worst-rated series.\n   - \"Casual\" is a series that Ted Danson starred in and had multiple seasons, but it might not be highly rated.\n   - \"Bored to Death\" is another series that could be a candidate, though it generally received positive reviews.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Compile a List of Ted Danson's Series**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search IMDb for a list of all TV series starring Ted Danson.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Extract the titles and number of seasons for each series.\n\n- **Step 2: Filter Series by Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check the Amazon Prime Video (US) website for the availability of each series.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Confirm which series are available and note their titles.\n\n- **Step 3: Check Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search Rotten Tomatoes for the ratings of the available series.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Record the Rotten Tomatoes scores for each series.\n\n- **Step 4: Filter and Identify the Worst-Rated Series**\n  - **Assistant**: Filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season.\n  - **Assistant**: Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score from the filtered list.\n\n- **Step 5: Verify and Present the Result**\n  - **Assistant**: Double-check the information for accuracy.\n  - **Assistant**: Present the worst-rated series with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US)."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the worst rated series (according to Rotten Tomatoes) with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series must be rated on Rotten Tomatoes.\n   - The goal is to find the worst-rated series according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of all series starring Ted Danson.\n   - The number of seasons for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - The availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Specific sources:\n     - IMDb for a comprehensive list of Ted Danson's TV appearances.\n     - Amazon Prime Video (US) website or app for availability.\n     - Rotten Tomatoes for ratings.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Filter the list of series to only those with more than 1 season.\n   - Filter the list to only those available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Identify the worst-rated series from the filtered list based on Rotten Tomatoes scores.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Ted Danson has starred in several well-known series, such as \"Cheers,\" \"The Good Place,\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" but these are likely not the worst-rated.\n   - Some of his lesser-known or more recent series might be candidates for the worst-rated series.\n   - \"Casual\" is a series that Ted Danson starred in and had multiple seasons, but it might not be highly rated.\n   - \"Bored to Death\" is another series that could be a candidate, though it generally received positive reviews.\n   - \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" is a long-running series where Ted Danson appeared in multiple episodes. It might have a lower rating due to its later seasons.\n   - \"Mr. Mayor\" is a more recent series that Ted Danson starred in and had two seasons. It might be a candidate for the worst-rated series.\n\n**REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"**: While the early seasons of \"CSI\" were very popular and well-received, the later seasons, especially after major cast changes, might have seen a decline in ratings. Since Ted Danson joined the series in later seasons, it's worth checking if the overall series rating reflects this.\n- **\"Mr. Mayor\"**: This series ran for two seasons and might not have been as critically acclaimed as some of Ted Danson's other works. Given its recent release, it could be a candidate for the worst-rated series.\n\nNext steps:\n- **WebSurfer**: Search IMDb for a comprehensive list of all TV series starring Ted Danson and extract the titles and number of seasons.\n- **WebSurfer**: Check the Amazon Prime Video (US) website for the availability of each series.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search Rotten Tomatoes for the ratings of the available series.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incomplete Data Extraction**: We did not successfully extract a complete list of TV series starring Ted Danson, including the number of seasons for each series.\n2. **Lack of Systematic Approach**: We did not systematically navigate through the IMDb page to ensure all relevant information was captured.\n3. **Insufficient Verification**: We did not verify the availability of the series on Amazon Prime Video (US) and their Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Extract Comprehensive List of Series**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Ted Danson's IMDb page and scroll down to the \"Filmography\" section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the titles and number of seasons for each TV series starring Ted Danson.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the list is complete by scrolling through the entire page.\n\n2. **Filter Series by Number of Seasons**:\n   - **Assistant**: Filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search Amazon Prime Video (US) for each series in the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm which series are available and note their titles.\n\n4. **Check Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search Rotten Tomatoes for the ratings of the available series.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the Rotten Tomatoes scores for each series.\n\n5. **Identify the Worst-Rated Series**:\n   - **Assistant**: Filter the list to include only series available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score from the filtered list.\n\n6. **Verify and Present the Result**:\n   - **Assistant**: Double-check the information for accuracy.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the worst-rated series with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Extract Comprehensive List of Series**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open Ted Danson's IMDb page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the \"Filmography\" section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the titles and number of seasons for each TV series starring Ted Danson.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the list is complete by scrolling through the entire page.\n\n2. **Filter Series by Number of Seasons**:\n   - **Assistant**: Create a list of series with more than 1 season.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open Amazon Prime Video (US) website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for each series in the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm availability and note the titles.\n\n4. **Check Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open Rotten Tomatoes website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for each available series.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the Rotten Tomatoes scores.\n\n5. **Identify the Worst-Rated Series**:\n   - **Assistant**: Filter the list to include only series available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score.\n\n6. **Verify and Present the Result**:\n   - **Assistant**: Double-check the information for accuracy.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final result.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Ensure Complete Data Extraction**: Use systematic scrolling and extraction to capture all relevant information from IMDb.\n- **Verify Each Step**: Double-check the availability on Amazon Prime Video (US) and the Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n- **Use Clear Filters**: Clearly filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season and those available on Amazon Prime Video (US)."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the worst rated series (according to Rotten Tomatoes) with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series must be rated on Rotten Tomatoes.\n   - The goal is to find the worst-rated series according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A comprehensive list of all series starring Ted Danson.\n   - The number of seasons for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - The availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Specific sources:\n     - IMDb for a comprehensive list of Ted Danson's TV appearances.\n     - Amazon Prime Video (US) website or app for availability.\n     - Rotten Tomatoes for ratings.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Filter the list of series to only those with more than 1 season.\n   - Filter the list to only those available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Identify the worst-rated series from the filtered list based on Rotten Tomatoes scores.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **\"Cheers\"**: A well-known and highly-rated series with 11 seasons. Unlikely to be the worst-rated.\n   - **\"The Good Place\"**: Another highly-rated series with 50 episodes over 4 seasons. Unlikely to be the worst-rated.\n   - **\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\"**: A popular series with multiple seasons. Ted Danson has appeared in 34 episodes. Likely not the worst-rated.\n   - **\"American Dad!\"**: A long-running animated series where Ted Danson voiced Dr. Ray Petit in 5 episodes. The series has many seasons, but Ted Danson's involvement is minimal.\n   - **\"Mulligan\"**: A recent series where Ted Danson voiced President Brad Chadman in 1 episode. Not enough seasons to qualify.\n   - **\"The Orville\"**: A sci-fi series where Ted Danson played Admiral Perry in 6 episodes. Not enough seasons to qualify.\n   - **\"Mr. Mayor\"**: A more recent series that Ted Danson starred in and had two seasons. It might be a candidate for the worst-rated series.\n   - **\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"**: Ted Danson joined the series in later seasons, which might have lower ratings. The series has many seasons, and Ted Danson appeared in 84 episodes. This is a strong candidate.\n   - **\"Casual\"**: A series that Ted Danson starred in and had multiple seasons. It might not be highly rated, making it a potential candidate.\n   - **\"Bored to Death\"**: Generally received positive reviews, but it's worth checking its Rotten Tomatoes score.\n\n**REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"**: The later seasons of \"CSI\" saw a decline in ratings, especially after major cast changes. Ted Danson's involvement in these later seasons makes it a strong candidate for the worst-rated series.\n- **\"Mr. Mayor\"**: This series ran for two seasons and might not have been as critically acclaimed as some of Ted Danson's other works. Given its recent release, it could be a candidate for the worst-rated series.\n- **\"Casual\"**: This series had multiple seasons and might not have been highly rated, making it another potential candidate.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Extract Comprehensive List of Series**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Ted Danson's IMDb page and scroll down to the 'Filmography' section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the titles and number of seasons for each TV series starring Ted Danson.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the list is complete by scrolling through the entire page.\n\n2. **Filter Series by Number of Seasons**:\n   - **Assistant**: Create a list of series with more than 1 season.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search Amazon Prime Video (US) for each series in the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm which series are available and note their titles.\n\n4. **Check Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search Rotten Tomatoes for the ratings of the available series.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the Rotten Tomatoes scores for each series.\n\n5. **Identify the Worst-Rated Series**:\n   - **Assistant**: Filter the list to include only series available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score from the filtered list.\n\n6. **Verify and Present the Result**:\n   - **Assistant**: Double-check the information for accuracy.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the worst-rated series with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Ensure Complete Data Extraction**: Use systematic scrolling and extraction to capture all relevant information from IMDb.\n- **Verify Each Step**: Double-check the availability on Amazon Prime Video (US) and the Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n- **Use Clear Filters**: Clearly filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season and those available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n### Action\n\nPlease navigate to Ted Danson's IMDb page and scroll down to the 'Filmography' section. Extract the titles and number of seasons for each TV series starring Ted Danson. Ensure the list is complete by scrolling through the entire page.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incomplete Data Extraction**: The WebSurfer did not successfully extract a complete list of TV series starring Ted Danson, including the number of seasons for each series.\n2. **Lack of Systematic Approach**: The WebSurfer did not systematically navigate through the IMDb page to ensure all relevant information was captured.\n3. **Insufficient Verification**: The WebSurfer did not verify the availability of the series on Amazon Prime Video (US) and their Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Extract Comprehensive List of Series**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open Ted Danson's IMDb page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the 'Filmography' section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the titles and number of seasons for each TV series starring Ted Danson.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the list is complete by scrolling through the entire page.\n\n2. **Filter Series by Number of Seasons**:\n   - **Assistant**: Create a list of series with more than 1 season.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open Amazon Prime Video (US) website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for each series in the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm availability and note the titles.\n\n4. **Check Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open Rotten Tomatoes website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for each available series.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the Rotten Tomatoes scores.\n\n5. **Identify the Worst-Rated Series**:\n   - **Assistant**: Filter the list to include only series available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score.\n\n6. **Verify and Present the Result**:\n   - **Assistant**: Double-check the information for accuracy.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final result.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Ensure Complete Data Extraction**: Use systematic scrolling and extraction to capture all relevant information from IMDb. Ensure the WebSurfer scrolls to the bottom of the page to capture all entries.\n- **Verify Each Step**: Double-check the availability on Amazon Prime Video (US) and the Rotten Tomatoes ratings. Ensure the WebSurfer confirms each step thoroughly.\n- **Use Clear Filters**: Clearly filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season and those available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Extract Comprehensive List of Series**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open Ted Danson's IMDb page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the 'Filmography' section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the titles and number of seasons for each TV series starring Ted Danson.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the list is complete by scrolling through the entire page.\n\n2. **Filter Series by Number of Seasons**:\n   - **Assistant**: Create a list of series with more than 1 season.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open Amazon Prime Video (US) website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for each series in the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm availability and note the titles.\n\n4. **Check Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open Rotten Tomatoes website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for each available series.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the Rotten Tomatoes scores.\n\n5. **Identify the Worst-Rated Series**:\n   - **Assistant**: Filter the list to include only series available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score.\n\n6. **Verify and Present the Result**:\n   - **Assistant**: Double-check the information for accuracy.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final result.\n\n### Action\n\nPlease navigate to Ted Danson's IMDb page and scroll down to the 'Filmography' section.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the worst rated series (according to Rotten Tomatoes) with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series must be rated on Rotten Tomatoes.\n   - The goal is to find the worst-rated series according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A comprehensive list of all series starring Ted Danson.\n   - The number of seasons for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - The availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Specific sources:\n     - IMDb for a comprehensive list of Ted Danson's TV appearances.\n     - Amazon Prime Video (US) website or app for availability.\n     - Rotten Tomatoes for ratings.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Filter the list of series to only those with more than 1 season.\n   - Filter the list to only those available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Identify the worst-rated series from the filtered list based on Rotten Tomatoes scores.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **\"Cheers\"**: A well-known and highly-rated series with 11 seasons. Unlikely to be the worst-rated.\n   - **\"The Good Place\"**: Another highly-rated series with 50 episodes over 4 seasons. Unlikely to be the worst-rated.\n   - **\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\"**: A popular series with multiple seasons. Ted Danson has appeared in 34 episodes. Likely not the worst-rated.\n   - **\"American Dad!\"**: A long-running animated series where Ted Danson voiced Dr. Ray Petit in 5 episodes. The series has many seasons, but Ted Danson's involvement is minimal.\n   - **\"Mulligan\"**: A recent series where Ted Danson voiced President Brad Chadman in 1 episode. Not enough seasons to qualify.\n   - **\"The Orville\"**: A sci-fi series where Ted Danson played Admiral Perry in 6 episodes. Not enough seasons to qualify.\n   - **\"Mr. Mayor\"**: A more recent series that Ted Danson starred in and had two seasons. It might be a candidate for the worst-rated series.\n   - **\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"**: Ted Danson joined the series in later seasons, which might have lower ratings. The series has many seasons, and Ted Danson appeared in 84 episodes. This is a strong candidate.\n   - **\"Casual\"**: A series that Ted Danson starred in and had multiple seasons. It might not be highly rated, making it a potential candidate.\n   - **\"Bored to Death\"**: Generally received positive reviews, but it's worth checking its Rotten Tomatoes score.\n\n**NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n   - **\"CSI: Cyber\"**: Ted Danson starred as D.B. Russell in this spin-off of \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" for 2 seasons. Given that spin-offs often struggle to match the ratings of the original series, it could be a candidate for the worst-rated series.\n   - **\"The Wrights\"**: A short series where Ted Danson played Phil. While it's a short series, it might still be worth checking its ratings and availability.\n   - **\"Where Everybody Knows Your Name with Ted Danson and Woody Harrelson (Sometimes)\"**: A podcast series, but it's worth noting for completeness, even though it's not a traditional TV series.\n\n**REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **\"CSI: Cyber\"**: Spin-offs often face challenges in maintaining the high ratings of their parent series. Ted Danson's involvement in this series for 2 seasons makes it a strong candidate for the worst-rated series.\n- **\"The Wrights\"**: Although it's a short series, it's important to check all possibilities to ensure we don't miss any potential candidates.\n- **\"Where Everybody Knows Your Name with Ted Danson and Woody Harrelson (Sometimes)\"**: While it's a podcast, it's worth noting for completeness, even though it doesn't fit the criteria of being a traditional TV series.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Extract Comprehensive List of Series**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Ted Danson's IMDb page and scroll down to the 'Filmography' section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the titles and number of seasons for each TV series starring Ted Danson.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the list is complete by scrolling through the entire page.\n\n2. **Filter Series by Number of Seasons**:\n   - **Assistant**: Create a list of series with more than 1 season.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US)**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search Amazon Prime Video (US) for each series in the filtered list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Confirm which series are available and note their titles.\n\n4. **Check Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search Rotten Tomatoes for the ratings of the available series.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the Rotten Tomatoes scores for each series.\n\n5. **Identify the Worst-Rated Series**:\n   - **Assistant**: Filter the list to include only series available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the series with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score from the filtered list.\n\n6. **Verify and Present the Result**:\n   - **Assistant**: Double-check the information for accuracy.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the worst-rated series with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Ensure Complete Data Extraction**: Use systematic scrolling and extraction to capture all relevant information from IMDb.\n- **Verify Each Step**: Double-check the availability on Amazon Prime Video (US) and the Rotten Tomatoes ratings.\n- **Use Clear Filters**: Clearly filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season and those available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n### Action\n\nPlease navigate to Ted Danson's IMDb page and scroll down to the 'Filmography' section.
