{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The issue is from the `numpy.polynomial` repository on GitHub.\n   - The issue is labeled as \"Regression.\"\n   - The issue is closed.\n   - We need to find the date in MM/DD/YY format when Regression was added to the oldest closed issue with the Regression label.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when the Regression label was added to the oldest closed issue in the `numpy.polynomial` repository.\n   - This information can be found by:\n     - Navigating to the `numpy/polynomial` repository on GitHub.\n     - Filtering issues to show only closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n     - Sorting the filtered issues by creation date to identify the oldest one.\n     - Checking the timeline or history of the oldest issue to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Converting the date found into the MM/DD/YY format if it is not already in that format.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is likely to have been created and labeled within the early years of the `numpy.polynomial` repository's existence, but this is a guess and needs verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Oldest Closed Issue with the \"Regression\" Label:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the `numpy/polynomial` GitHub repository.\n  - Filter issues to show only closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n  - Sort the filtered issues by creation date to identify the oldest one.\n\n- **Determine When the \"Regression\" Label Was Added:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to open the identified oldest closed issue.\n  - Check the timeline or history of the issue to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n- **Convert the Date to MM/DD/YY Format:**\n  - If the date is not already in MM/DD/YY format, use Assistant to convert it.\n\n- **Report the Final Answer:**\n  - Provide the date in MM/DD/YY format as the final answer."}

I think the problem is that there is no way to specify the shape and type of the array returned by __array_interface__ when the object is not a true array. In this case, it's just a single number, but it could be something else. I'll try to come up with a patch for this soon.mwiebe\ncommented\nmwiebe\nMember\nI think that the problem is that the __array_interface__ protocol is not well-defined for non-arrays.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress we've made and the new insights we've gained:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The issue is from the `numpy` repository on GitHub, not specifically the `numpy.polynomial` repository.\n   - The issue is labeled as \"Regression.\"\n   - The issue is closed.\n   - We need to find the date in MM/DD/YY format when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue in the `numpy` repository.\n   - This information can be found by:\n     - Navigating to the `numpy` repository on GitHub.\n     - Filtering issues to show only closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n     - Sorting the filtered issues by creation date to identify the oldest one.\n     - Checking the timeline or history of the oldest issue to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Converting the date found into the MM/DD/YY format if it is not already in that format.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is likely to have been created and labeled within the early years of the `numpy` repository's existence, but this is a guess and needs verification.\n   - Based on the issues we have seen, the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label might be from around 2012 or earlier, given that the `numpy` repository has been active since 2005.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- We have identified the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label as \"Changes in PyArray_FromAny between 1.5.x and 1.6.x\" (Issue #291).\n- We need to scroll down to the timeline of this issue to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\nLet's proceed to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to Issue #291.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Repository**: Initially, we tried to search in the `numpy.polynomial` repository, which does not exist. The correct repository is `numpy/numpy`.\n- **Incomplete Navigation**: After identifying the correct repository, we navigated to the issues but did not scroll far enough to find the timeline where the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest issue.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: We did not explicitly instruct the WebSurfer to look for the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added, leading to incomplete information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Repository**:\n   - WebSurfer: Navigate to the `numpy/numpy` repository on GitHub.\n\n2. **Filter and Sort Issues**:\n   - WebSurfer: Click on the 'Issues' tab.\n   - WebSurfer: Apply filters to show only closed issues with the 'Regression' label.\n   - WebSurfer: Sort the filtered issues by creation date to identify the oldest one.\n\n3. **Identify the Oldest Issue**:\n   - WebSurfer: Click on the oldest closed issue with the 'Regression' label (Issue #291).\n\n4. **Scroll to the Timeline**:\n   - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the timeline of the issue to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n5. **Extract the Date**:\n   - WebSurfer: Identify the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added and report it in MM/DD/YY format.\n\n6. **Convert the Date (if necessary)**:\n   - Assistant: Convert the date to MM/DD/YY format if it is not already in that format.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the `numpy/numpy` repository.\n  - WebSurfer: Go to [https://github.com/numpy/numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy).\n\n- **Step 2**: Filter and sort issues.\n  - WebSurfer: Click on the 'Issues' tab.\n  - WebSurfer: Click on 'Filters' and select 'Closed'.\n  - WebSurfer: Click on 'Labels' and select 'Regression'.\n  - WebSurfer: Click on 'Sort by' and select 'Oldest'.\n\n- **Step 3**: Identify the oldest issue.\n  - WebSurfer: Click on the oldest issue (Issue #291).\n\n- **Step 4**: Scroll to the timeline.\n  - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the timeline section of the issue.\n\n- **Step 5**: Extract the date.\n  - WebSurfer: Look for the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added and report it.\n\n- **Step 6**: Convert the date.\n  - Assistant: If the date is not in MM/DD/YY format, convert it.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Be Specific**: When instructing the WebSurfer, be specific about what to look for and where to find it.\n- **Check the Timeline**: Ensure the WebSurfer scrolls down to the timeline section of the issue to find the label addition date.\n- **Verify the Date Format**: Double-check the date format to ensure it is reported correctly.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan."}

What strikes me is how different arange and linspace behave in 1.6.x (haven't looked at 1.7):\nsage: import numpy sage: numpy.arange(10.0) array([ 0., 1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9.]) sage: numpy.linspace(0,9,10) array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9], dtype=object) \nI would have expected the output to be identical and certainly to have the same type. That was certainly the case in 1.5.x. My point here is that the return type is inconsistent between a function that is coded purely in C in numpy compared to one that use some python. For reference what happens in linspace is:\n def linspace(start, stop, num=50, endpoint=True, retstep=False): num = int(num) if num <= 0: return array([], float) if endpoint: if num == 1: return array([float(start)]) step = (stop-start)/float((num-1)) y = _nx.arange(0, num) * step + start y[-1] = stop else: step = (stop-start)/float(num) y = _nx.arange(0, num) * step + start if retstep: return y, step else: return y\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Even if this is \"off-label\" use, it's a reasonable use-case, and if the array factory function used to inspect the array interface to get type information on its objects, then it should continue to do that. This should not have changed. I think this is a blocker for 1.7\nteoliphant\ncommented\nteoliphant\nMember\nThe following example breaks on 1.6.x / HEAD --- Updated!\n class Foo(object): def __init__(self, value) self.value = value def __float__(self): return float(self.value) @property def __array_interface__(self): return {'typestr': '=f8'} f = Foo(0.5) import numpy result2 = numpy.array(f) assert result2.dtype == numpy.dtype('f8') \nteoliphant\ncommented\nteoliphant\nMember\nWhat is causing this regression is that PyArray_GetArrayParamsFromObject called form PyArray_Any has different semantics with respect to the array_interface than _array_find_type did --- at least for a single objects.\nIt seems like we need to add code into PyArray_GetArrayParamsFromObject that allows only typestr to be queried from the ArrayInterface and returns that type information (instead of the full array) when possible. This relies on later code outside of GetArrayParamsFromObject to actually produce the array.

I am guessing mwhansen tried his code with numpy-1.6.1, I don't know if he tested 1.6.2. My result with linspace is still present in 1.6.2 and it sounds in line with what you are saying.\nteoliphant\ncommented\nteoliphant\nMember\nYes, all the 1.6 releases will have this problem. This can be fixed.\n87\ncommented\n87\nContributor\nHmm, it seems that the reason this has worked is because the Foo object was coerced into a float without going through the array interface (PyArray_FromInterface) at all. The array interface specifies that the data should be available through the buffer interface, which isn't the case for Foo..\nThe following works for me:\nclass Foo(object): def __init__(self, value): self.value = value def __float__(self): return float(self.value) @property def __array_interface__(self): return {'typestr': '=f8'} f = Foo(0.5) np.array([f,f]) array([ 0.5, 0.5]) But this does not:\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress we've made and the new insights we've gained:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The issue is from the `numpy` repository on GitHub.\n   - The issue is labeled as \"Regression.\"\n   - The issue is closed.\n   - We need to find the date in MM/DD/YY format when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is \"Changes in PyArray_FromAny between 1.5.x and 1.6.x\" (Issue #291).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to Issue #291.\n   - This information can be found by:\n     - Navigating to the `numpy` repository on GitHub.\n     - Filtering issues to show only closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n     - Sorting the filtered issues by creation date to identify the oldest one.\n     - Scrolling down to the timeline of Issue #291 to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Converting the date found into the MM/DD/YY format if it is not already in that format.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The \"Regression\" label was likely added to Issue #291 during the early stages of the issue's lifecycle, possibly shortly after it was opened.\n   - Given the activity and comments on the issue, the \"Regression\" label was probably added within the first few days or weeks of the issue being opened, which was on June 5, 2012.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- The issue was created on June 5, 2012.\n- The issue has a significant amount of discussion and interaction, indicating that it was a notable regression.\n- We need to carefully examine the timeline of the issue to pinpoint the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the Timeline Section**:\n   - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the timeline section of Issue #291 to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n2. **Extract the Date**:\n   - WebSurfer: Identify the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added and report it in MM/DD/YY format.\n\n3. **Convert the Date (if necessary)**:\n   - Assistant: If the date is not in MM/DD/YY format, convert it.\n\n### Hints\n- **Be Specific**: When instructing the WebSurfer, be specific about what to look for and where to find it.\n- **Check the Timeline**: Ensure the WebSurfer scrolls down to the timeline section of the issue to find the label addition date.\n- **Verify the Date Format**: Double-check the date format to ensure it is reported correctly.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to Issue #291.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Focus**: The previous attempts focused too much on scrolling through the page without explicitly looking for the \"Regression\" label addition event in the timeline.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions to the WebSurfer were not specific enough to ensure it was looking for the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: The WebSurfer did not navigate directly to the timeline section of the issue, which contains the necessary information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Issue Page**:\n   - WebSurfer: Go to [https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/291](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/291).\n\n2. **Scroll to the Timeline Section**:\n   - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the timeline section of the issue. This section typically appears below the main comments and shows all events related to the issue.\n\n3. **Find the \"Regression\" Label Addition Event**:\n   - WebSurfer: Look for the event in the timeline that indicates when the \"Regression\" label was added. This event will be listed with a timestamp.\n\n4. **Extract the Date**:\n   - WebSurfer: Identify the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added and report it in MM/DD/YY format.\n\n5. **Convert the Date (if necessary)**:\n   - Assistant: If the date is not in MM/DD/YY format, convert it.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the correct issue page.\n  - WebSurfer: Go to [https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/291](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/291).\n\n- **Step 2**: Scroll to the timeline section.\n  - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the timeline section of the issue.\n\n- **Step 3**: Find the \"Regression\" label addition event.\n  - WebSurfer: Look for the event in the timeline that indicates when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n- **Step 4**: Extract the date.\n  - WebSurfer: Identify the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added and report it in MM/DD/YY format.\n\n- **Step 5**: Convert the date (if necessary).\n  - Assistant: If the date is not in MM/DD/YY format, convert it.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Be Specific**: When instructing the WebSurfer, be specific about what to look for and where to find it.\n- **Check the Timeline**: Ensure the WebSurfer scrolls down to the timeline section of the issue to find the label addition date.\n- **Verify the Date Format**: Double-check the date format to ensure it is reported correctly.\n\nLet's proceed with the new plan. WebSurfer, please go to [https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/291](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/291) and scroll down to the timeline section to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.

What strikes me is how different arange and linspace behave in 1.6.x (haven't looked at 1.7):\nsage: import numpy sage: numpy.arange(10.0) array([ 0., 1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9.]) sage: numpy.linspace(0,9,10) array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9], dtype=object) \nI would have expected the output to be identical and certainly to have the same type. That was certainly the case in 1.5.x. My point here is that the return type is inconsistent between a function that is coded purely in C in numpy compared to one that use some python. For reference what happens in linspace is:\n def linspace(start, stop, num=50, endpoint=True, retstep=False): num = int(num) if num <= 0: return array([], float) if endpoint: if num == 1: return array([float(start)]) step = (stop-start)/float((num-1)) y = _nx.arange(0, num) * step + start y[-1] = stop else: step = (stop-start)/float(num) y = _nx.arange(0, num) * step + start if retstep: return y, step else: return y\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Even if this is \"off-label\" use, it's a reasonable use-case, and if the array factory function used to inspect the array interface to get type information on its objects, then it should continue to do that. This should not have changed.

This relies on later code outside of GetArrayParamsFromObject to actually produce the array.

I am guessing mwhansen tried his code with numpy-1.6.1, I don't know if he tested 1.6.2.

This can be fixed.\n87\ncommented\n87\nContributor\nHmm, it seems that the reason this has worked is because the Foo object was coerced into a float without going through the array interface (PyArray_FromInterface) at all. The array interface specifies that the data should be available through the buffer interface, which isn't the case for Foo..\nThe following works for me:\nclass Foo(object): def __init__(self, value): self.value = value def __float__(self): return float(self.value) @property def __array_interface__(self): return {'typestr': '=f8'} f = Foo(0.5) np.array([f,f]) array([ 0.5, 0.5]) But this does not:\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the progress we've made and the new insights we've gained:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The issue is from the `numpy` repository on GitHub.\n   - The issue is labeled as \"Regression.\"\n   - The issue is closed.\n   - We need to find the date in MM/DD/YY format when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is \"Changes in PyArray_FromAny between 1.5.x and 1.6.x\" (Issue #291).\n   - The issue was created on June 5, 2012.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when the \"Regression\" label was added to Issue #291.\n   - This information can be found by:\n     - Navigating to the `numpy` repository on GitHub.\n     - Filtering issues to show only closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n     - Sorting the filtered issues by creation date to identify the oldest one.\n     - Scrolling down to the timeline of Issue #291 to find when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Converting the date found into the MM/DD/YY format if it is not already in that format.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The \"Regression\" label was likely added to Issue #291 during the early stages of the issue's lifecycle, possibly shortly after it was opened.\n   - Given the activity and comments on the issue, the \"Regression\" label was probably added within the first few days or weeks of the issue being opened, which was on June 5, 2012.\n   - The \"Regression\" label might have been added by one of the core contributors, such as `teoliphant`, `njsmith`, or `mwiebe`, given their active participation in the issue.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- The issue has a significant amount of discussion and interaction, indicating that it was a notable regression.\n- We need to carefully examine the timeline of the issue to pinpoint the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- The timeline section of the issue page on GitHub typically includes all events, including label additions, comments, and other interactions.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to the Timeline Section**:\n   - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the timeline section of Issue #291 to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n2. **Extract the Date**:\n   - WebSurfer: Identify the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added and report it in MM/DD/YY format.\n\n3. **Convert the Date (if necessary)**:\n   - Assistant: If the date is not in MM/DD/YY format, convert it.\n\n### Hints\n- **Be Specific**: When instructing the WebSurfer, be specific about what to look for and where to find it.\n- **Check the Timeline**: Ensure the WebSurfer scrolls down to the timeline section of the issue to find the label addition date.\n- **Verify the Date Format**: Double-check the date format to ensure it is reported correctly.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to Issue #291.\n\nWebSurfer, please scroll down to the timeline section of Issue #291 and find the event that indicates when the \"Regression\" label was added. Report the date in MM/DD/YY format.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Focus**: The WebSurfer has been scrolling through the page but not specifically looking for the \"Regression\" label addition event in the timeline.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions to the WebSurfer were not detailed enough to ensure it was looking for the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: The WebSurfer did not navigate directly to the timeline section of the issue, which contains the necessary information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Issue Page**:\n   - WebSurfer: Go to [https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/291](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/291).\n\n2. **Scroll to the Timeline Section**:\n   - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the timeline section of the issue. This section typically appears below the main comments and shows all events related to the issue.\n\n3. **Find the \"Regression\" Label Addition Event**:\n   - WebSurfer: Look for the event in the timeline that indicates when the \"Regression\" label was added. This event will be listed with a timestamp.\n\n4. **Extract the Date**:\n   - WebSurfer: Identify the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added and report it in MM/DD/YY format.\n\n5. **Convert the Date (if necessary)**:\n   - Assistant: If the date is not in MM/DD/YY format, convert it.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the correct issue page.\n  - WebSurfer: Go to [https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/291](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/291).\n\n- **Step 2**: Scroll to the timeline section.\n  - WebSurfer: Scroll down to the timeline section of the issue.\n\n- **Step 3**: Find the \"Regression\" label addition event.\n  - WebSurfer: Look for the event in the timeline that indicates when the \"Regression\" label was added. This event will be listed with a timestamp.\n\n- **Step 4**: Extract the date.\n  - WebSurfer: Identify the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added and report it in MM/DD/YY format.\n\n- **Step 5**: Convert the date (if necessary).\n  - Assistant: If the date is not in MM/DD/YY format, convert it.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Be Specific**: When instructing the WebSurfer, be specific about what to look for and where to find it.\n- **Check the Timeline**: Ensure the WebSurfer scrolls down to the timeline section of the issue to find the label addition date.\n- **Verify the Date Format**: Double-check the date format to ensure it is reported correctly.\n\n### Action\n\nWebSurfer, please go to [https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/291](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/291) and scroll down to the timeline section. Find the event that indicates when the \"Regression\" label was added and report the date in MM/DD/YY format."}
