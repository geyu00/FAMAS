{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nHow much does it cost to send an envelope with 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with DHL, USPS, or Fedex? (Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The item to be sent is an envelope.\n   - The desired delivery time is 1 week.\n   - The sender's location is Rio de Janeiro.\n   - The recipient's location is New York City (NYC).\n   - The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to New York City.\n   - Specific details on 1-week delivery options for each service provider.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping.\n   - Weight and size limits for envelopes for each shipping service.\n   - These details can be found on the official websites of DHL, USPS, and FedEx, or through their customer service.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping service, including any additional fees or taxes.\n   - Whether the 1-week delivery option is available for envelopes and what the exact delivery times are.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The cost of shipping an envelope internationally will likely vary between the three services, with DHL and FedEx potentially being more expensive due to their focus on express and business shipping.\n   - USPS might offer a more affordable rate but could have longer delivery times or fewer tracking options.\n   - Additional fees such as customs duties or handling charges may apply, especially for DHL and FedEx.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify Shipping Rates**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to the official websites of DHL, USPS, and FedEx to find the current shipping rates for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to New York City.\n- **Locate 1-Week Delivery Options**: On each website, locate the specific 1-week delivery options for envelopes, if available.\n- **Check Additional Fees**: Verify if there are any additional fees or taxes for international shipping that need to be included in the total cost.\n- **Compile Data**: Once the rates and additional fees are identified, compile the data into a JSON format with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n- **Format Response**: Ensure the final response is formatted correctly as a list of JSON objects."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nHow much does it cost to send an envelope with 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with DHL, USPS, or Fedex? (Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The item to be sent is an envelope.\n   - The desired delivery time is 1 week.\n   - The sender's location is Rio de Janeiro.\n   - The recipient's location is New York City (NYC).\n   - The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - The USPS price calculator requires specific details such as the weight of the envelope, the value of the item, and the quantity.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for DHL, USPS, and FedEx for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to New York City.\n   - Specific details on 1-week delivery options for each service provider.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping.\n   - Weight and size limits for envelopes for each shipping service.\n   - These details can be found on the official websites of DHL, USPS, and FedEx, or through their customer service.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping service, including any additional fees or taxes.\n   - Whether the 1-week delivery option is available for envelopes and what the exact delivery times are.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The cost of shipping an envelope internationally will likely vary between the three services, with DHL and FedEx potentially being more expensive due to their focus on express and business shipping.\n   - USPS might offer a more affordable rate but could have longer delivery times or fewer tracking options.\n   - Additional fees such as customs duties or handling charges may apply, especially for DHL and FedEx.\n   - The USPS price calculator might not directly provide a 1-week delivery option, but it can give us an estimate for the fastest available service, which we can then compare to a 1-week timeframe.\n   - DHL and FedEx websites might have more straightforward options for selecting a 1-week delivery, given their focus on express services.\n\n**REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **USPS Price Calculator**: The USPS price calculator requires detailed inputs, and it might not explicitly list a 1-week delivery option. However, by selecting the fastest available service, we can infer if it meets the 1-week requirement.\n- **DHL and FedEx**: These companies often have more direct options for express shipping, making it easier to find a 1-week delivery service. Their websites typically have calculators that allow for more specific delivery time selections.\n- **Additional Fees**: Given the nature of international shipping, it is reasonable to expect additional fees such as customs duties and handling charges, especially for DHL and FedEx, which are known for their comprehensive services and higher standards.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to gather the required information from DHL and FedEx websites.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Web Surfer Issues**:\n   - The WebSurfer encountered technical issues when trying to navigate to the DHL website, resulting in repeated errors.\n   - The USPS price calculator required detailed inputs that were not correctly filled out, leading to incomplete form submissions.\n\n2. **Form Filling Errors**:\n   - There were multiple attempts to fill out the USPS price calculator form, but the fields were not consistently completed, leading to validation errors.\n\n3. **Lack of Clear Instructions**:\n   - The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were sometimes ambiguous, leading to incorrect actions being taken.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to DHL Website**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use the WebSurfer to search for \"DHL shipping rates from Rio de Janeiro to New York City 1-week delivery.\"\n   - **Step 2**: Click on the first relevant link to the DHL website.\n   - **Step 3**: Navigate to the shipping rate calculator or pricing page.\n   - **Step 4**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Sender Location: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n     - Recipient Location: New York City, USA\n     - Item Type: Envelope\n     - Weight: 0.1 pounds (or the actual weight of the envelope)\n     - Value: $10 (or the actual value of the item)\n   - **Step 5**: Submit the form and note the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n2. **Navigate to FedEx Website**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use the WebSurfer to search for \"FedEx shipping rates from Rio de Janeiro to New York City 1-week delivery.\"\n   - **Step 2**: Click on the first relevant link to the FedEx website.\n   - **Step 3**: Navigate to the shipping rate calculator or pricing page.\n   - **Step 4**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Sender Location: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n     - Recipient Location: New York City, USA\n     - Item Type: Envelope\n     - Weight: 0.1 pounds (or the actual weight of the envelope)\n     - Value: $10 (or the actual value of the item)\n   - **Step 5**: Submit the form and note the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n3. **Navigate to USPS Website**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use the WebSurfer to search for \"USPS shipping rates from Rio de Janeiro to New York City 1-week delivery.\"\n   - **Step 2**: Click on the first relevant link to the USPS website.\n   - **Step 3**: Navigate to the international shipping rate calculator.\n   - **Step 4**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Destination Country: Brazil\n     - Item Type: Envelope\n     - Weight: 0.1 pounds (or the actual weight of the envelope)\n     - Value: $10 (or the actual value of the item)\n     - Quantity: 1\n   - **Step 5**: Submit the form and note the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n4. **Compile Data**:\n   - **Step 1**: Collect the shipping rates and any additional fees from DHL, FedEx, and USPS.\n   - **Step 2**: Format the data into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n\n5. **Format Response**:\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the final response is formatted correctly as a list of JSON objects.\n   - **Step 2**: Provide the list of JSON objects as the final answer.\n\n### Example JSON Format\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"DHL\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 25.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"FedEx\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 30.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 20.00\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis plan ensures that each step is clearly defined and that the WebSurfer is given specific instructions to avoid previous issues."}

(Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The item to be sent is an envelope.\n   - The desired delivery time is 1 week.\n   - The sender's location is Rio de Janeiro.\n   - The recipient's location is New York City (NYC).\n   - The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - The USPS price calculator requires specific details such as the weight of the envelope, the value of the item, and the quantity.\n   - The FedEx website is currently experiencing technical issues and is not accessible for rate calculations.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Current shipping rates for DHL and USPS for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to New York City.\n   - Specific details on 1-week delivery options for DHL and USPS.\n   - Any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping.\n   - Weight and size limits for envelopes for DHL and USPS.\n   - These details can be found on the official websites of DHL and USPS, or through their customer service.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The total cost for each shipping service, including any additional fees or taxes.\n   - Whether the 1-week delivery option is available for envelopes and what the exact delivery times are.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The cost of shipping an envelope internationally will likely vary between the three services, with DHL potentially being more expensive due to its focus on express and business shipping.\n   - USPS might offer a more affordable rate but could have longer delivery times or fewer tracking options.\n   - Additional fees such as customs duties or handling charges may apply, especially for DHL, which is known for its comprehensive services and higher standards.\n   - The USPS price calculator might not directly provide a 1-week delivery option, but it can give us an estimate for the fastest available service, which we can then compare to a 1-week timeframe.\n   - DHL's website is expected to have more straightforward options for selecting a 1-week delivery, given its focus on express services.\n\n**NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **Technical Issues with FedEx**: Given the current technical issues with the FedEx website, it is likely that the rates and options for FedEx will need to be obtained through alternative means, such as customer service or a different online resource.\n- **USPS International Priority Mail**: USPS International Priority Mail might be the closest option to a 1-week delivery service, and it is worth checking if it meets the required delivery time.\n- **DHL Express Worldwide**: DHL's Express Worldwide service is likely to offer a 1-week delivery option, and it is expected to be more expensive but more reliable for urgent shipments.\n\n**REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **Technical Issues with FedEx**: Since the FedEx website is down, it is logical to assume that we will need to use alternative methods to obtain the necessary information. Customer service or third-party shipping calculators could be viable alternatives.\n- **USPS International Priority Mail**: USPS International Priority Mail is known for faster delivery times compared to standard international mail, making it a suitable candidate for meeting the 1-week requirement.\n- **DHL Express Worldwide**: DHL is renowned for its express shipping services, and the Express Worldwide option is likely to meet the 1-week delivery requirement, albeit at a higher cost.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to DHL Website**:\n   - Use the WebSurfer to search for \"DHL shipping rates from Rio de Janeiro to New York City 1-week delivery.\"\n   - Click on the first relevant link to the DHL website.\n   - Navigate to the shipping rate calculator or pricing page.\n   - Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Sender Location: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n     - Recipient Location: New York City, USA\n     - Item Type: Envelope\n     - Weight: 0.1 pounds (or the actual weight of the envelope)\n     - Value: $10 (or the actual value of the item)\n   - Submit the form and note the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n2. **Navigate to USPS Website**:\n   - Use the WebSurfer to search for \"USPS shipping rates from Rio de Janeiro to New York City 1-week delivery.\"\n   - Click on the first relevant link to the USPS website.\n   - Navigate to the international shipping rate calculator.\n   - Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Destination Country: Brazil\n     - Item Type: Envelope\n     - Weight: 0.1 pounds (or the actual weight of the envelope)\n     - Value: $10 (or the actual value of the item)\n     - Quantity: 1\n   - Submit the form and note the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n3. **Alternative Methods for FedEx**:\n   - Use the WebSurfer to search for \"FedEx shipping rates from Rio de Janeiro to New York City 1-week delivery\" on a third-party shipping calculator or review site.\n   - Alternatively, contact FedEx customer service for the rates and options.\n\n4. **Compile Data**:\n   - Collect the shipping rates and any additional fees from DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n   - Format the data into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n\n5. **Format Response**:\n   - Ensure the final response is formatted correctly as a list of JSON objects.\n   - Provide the list of JSON objects as the final answer.\n\n### Example JSON Format\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"DHL\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 25.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"FedEx\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 30.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 20.00\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis updated plan and fact sheet should help us gather the required information more effectively. Let's start with navigating to the DHL website.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Technical Issues with DHL and FedEx Websites**:\n   - Both the DHL and FedEx websites experienced technical issues, preventing us from accessing their shipping rate calculators.\n   - The DHL website did not load properly, and the FedEx website displayed a system down message.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Form Filling**:\n   - The form fields for the USPS price calculator were not consistently filled out, leading to validation errors and incomplete submissions.\n\n3. **Ambiguous Instructions**:\n   - The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were sometimes unclear, leading to incorrect actions being taken.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to DHL Website**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use the WebSurfer to search for \"DHL shipping rates from Rio de Janeiro to New York City 1-week delivery.\"\n   - **Step 2**: Click on the first relevant link to the DHL website.\n   - **Step 3**: Navigate to the shipping rate calculator or pricing page.\n   - **Step 4**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Sender Location: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n     - Recipient Location: New York City, USA\n     - Item Type: Envelope\n     - Weight: 0.1 pounds (or the actual weight of the envelope)\n     - Value: $10 (or the actual value of the item)\n   - **Step 5**: Submit the form and note the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n   - **Step 6**: If the website is still down, use a third-party shipping calculator or contact DHL customer service for the rates.\n\n2. **Navigate to USPS Website**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use the WebSurfer to search for \"USPS shipping rates from Rio de Janeiro to New York City 1-week delivery.\"\n   - **Step 2**: Click on the first relevant link to the USPS website.\n   - **Step 3**: Navigate to the international shipping rate calculator.\n   - **Step 4**: Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Destination Country: Brazil\n     - Item Type: Envelope\n     - Weight: 0.1 pounds (or the actual weight of the envelope)\n     - Value: $10 (or the actual value of the item)\n     - Quantity: 1\n   - **Step 5**: Submit the form and note the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n   - **Step 6**: Ensure all form fields are filled out correctly to avoid validation errors.\n\n3. **Alternative Methods for FedEx**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use the WebSurfer to search for \"FedEx shipping rates from Rio de Janeiro to New York City 1-week delivery\" on a third-party shipping calculator or review site.\n   - **Step 2**: Alternatively, contact FedEx customer service for the rates and options.\n   - **Step 3**: Note the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n4. **Compile Data**:\n   - **Step 1**: Collect the shipping rates and any additional fees from DHL, FedEx, and USPS.\n   - **Step 2**: Format the data into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n\n5. **Format Response**:\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the final response is formatted correctly as a list of JSON objects.\n   - **Step 2**: Provide the list of JSON objects as the final answer.\n\n### Example JSON Format\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"DHL\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 25.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"FedEx\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 30.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 20.00\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Double-Check Form Fields**: Ensure all form fields are filled out correctly before submitting the form.\n- **Use Third-Party Resources**: If the official websites are down, use third-party shipping calculators or contact customer service.\n- **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear and specific instructions to the WebSurfer to avoid ambiguity.\n- **Wait for Pages to Load**: Use the `sleep` function to ensure pages are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan, starting with navigating to the DHL website."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nHow much does it cost to send an envelope with 1-week delivery from Rio de Janeiro to NYC with DHL, USPS, or Fedex? (Format your answers as a list of jsons with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each option you find)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n- The item to be sent is an envelope.\n- The desired delivery time is 1 week.\n- The sender's location is Rio de Janeiro.\n- The recipient's location is New York City (NYC).\n- The shipping options to consider are DHL, USPS, and FedEx.\n- The USPS price calculator requires specific details such as the weight of the envelope, the value of the item, and the quantity.\n- The FedEx website is currently experiencing technical issues and is not accessible for rate calculations.\n- The DHL website is also experiencing issues, making it difficult to access the shipping rate calculator directly.\n\n#### 2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n- Current shipping rates for DHL and USPS for sending an envelope from Rio de Janeiro to New York City.\n- Specific details on 1-week delivery options for DHL and USPS.\n- Any additional fees or taxes that may apply for international shipping.\n- Weight and size limits for envelopes for DHL and USPS.\n- Alternative methods to obtain shipping rates for DHL and FedEx, such as third-party calculators or customer service.\n\n#### 3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n- The total cost for each shipping service, including any additional fees or taxes.\n- Whether the 1-week delivery option is available for envelopes and what the exact delivery times are.\n\n#### 4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n- The cost of shipping an envelope internationally will likely vary between the three services, with DHL potentially being more expensive due to its focus on express and business shipping.\n- USPS might offer a more affordable rate but could have longer delivery times or fewer tracking options.\n- Additional fees such as customs duties or handling charges may apply, especially for DHL, which is known for its comprehensive services and higher standards.\n- The USPS price calculator might not directly provide a 1-week delivery option, but it can give us an estimate for the fastest available service, which we can then compare to a 1-week timeframe.\n- DHL's website is expected to have more straightforward options for selecting a 1-week delivery, given its focus on express services.\n\n**NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **Technical Issues with FedEx and DHL**: Given the current technical issues with both the FedEx and DHL websites, it is highly likely that the rates and options for these services will need to be obtained through alternative means, such as customer service or third-party shipping calculators.\n- **USPS International Priority Mail**: USPS International Priority Mail might be the closest option to a 1-week delivery service, and it is worth checking if it meets the required delivery time.\n- **Third-Party Calculators**: Using third-party shipping calculators for DHL and FedEx is a viable alternative to obtain the necessary rates and options.\n\n**REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **Technical Issues with FedEx and DHL**: Since both websites are down, it is logical to assume that we will need to use alternative methods to obtain the necessary information. Customer service or third-party shipping calculators could be viable alternatives.\n- **USPS International Priority Mail**: USPS International Priority Mail is known for faster delivery times compared to standard international mail, making it a suitable candidate for meeting the 1-week requirement.\n- **Third-Party Calculators**: Third-party calculators often provide a consolidated view of shipping rates from multiple carriers, which can be useful when official websites are unavailable.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Use Third-Party Shipping Calculators**:\n   - **DHL**:\n     - Use the WebSurfer to search for \"third-party shipping calculator for DHL rates from Rio de Janeiro to New York City.\"\n     - Click on the first relevant link to a third-party shipping calculator.\n     - Fill out the form with the following details:\n       - Origin Country: Brazil\n       - Destination Country: USA\n       - Package Weight: 0.1 kg\n       - Dimensions: Length: 10 cm, Width: 10 cm, Height: 1 cm\n       - Service Type: Express\n     - Submit the form and note the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n   - **FedEx**:\n     - Use the WebSurfer to search for \"third-party shipping calculator for FedEx rates from Rio de Janeiro to New York City.\"\n     - Click on the first relevant link to a third-party shipping calculator.\n     - Fill out the form with the following details:\n       - Origin Country: Brazil\n       - Destination Country: USA\n       - Package Weight: 0.1 kg\n       - Dimensions: Length: 10 cm, Width: 10 cm, Height: 1 cm\n       - Service Type: Express\n     - Submit the form and note the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n2. **Navigate to USPS Website**:\n   - Use the WebSurfer to search for \"USPS shipping rates from Rio de Janeiro to New York City 1-week delivery.\"\n   - Click on the first relevant link to the USPS website.\n   - Navigate to the international shipping rate calculator.\n   - Fill out the form with the following details:\n     - Destination Country: Brazil\n     - Item Type: Envelope\n     - Weight: 0.1 pounds (or the actual weight of the envelope)\n     - Value: $10 (or the actual value of the item)\n     - Quantity: 1\n   - Submit the form and note the shipping rate and any additional fees.\n\n3. **Compile Data**:\n   - Collect the shipping rates and any additional fees from DHL, FedEx, and USPS.\n   - Format the data into a list of JSON objects with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\" for each shipping option.\n\n4. **Format Response**:\n   - Ensure the final response is formatted correctly as a list of JSON objects.\n   - Provide the list of JSON objects as the final answer.\n\n### Example JSON Format\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"DHL\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 25.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"FedEx\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 30.00\n    },\n    {\n        \"sender\": \"USPS\",\n        \"price (usd)\": 20.00\n    }\n]\n```\n\nLet's start with using a third-party shipping calculator for DHL rates.
