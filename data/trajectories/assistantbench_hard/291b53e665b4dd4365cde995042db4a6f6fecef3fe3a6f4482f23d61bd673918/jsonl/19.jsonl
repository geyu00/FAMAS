It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The date of interest is 20/10/2020.\n   - The file type of interest is a GFF3 file.\n   - The species of interest is the beluga whale.\n   - The Ensembl database contains genomic data for the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific GFF3 file for beluga whales released on or before 20/10/2020.\n   - The exact URL or direct link to the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The release date of the GFF3 file to verify it is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Verification that the GFF3 file found is indeed the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n   - Cross-referencing the file's release date with the date provided in the request to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file for beluga whales is likely to be hosted on the Ensembl database, given that it is a reputable genomics database and contains data for the beluga whale.\n   - The GFF3 file may be part of a larger dataset or project related to marine mammal genomics.\n   - The file could be associated with a scientific publication or research study that was published around the same time.\n   - The Ensembl FTP site is a likely source for downloading the GFF3 file, as it provides access to complete datasets and databases.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- Given that the Ensembl page for beluga whales exists and offers various downloads, it is highly likely that the GFF3 file is available there.\n- The Ensembl FTP site is a common and reliable source for downloading large genomic datasets, including GFF3 files.\n- The presence of a specific genome assembly (ASM228892v3) suggests that the data is well-maintained and regularly updated, increasing the likelihood that the most recent file as of 20/10/2020 is available.\n\nPlease proceed to the 'Downloads' section of the Ensembl page for beluga whales and locate the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020. Extract the direct URL or download link for the file and verify its release date.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigation Error**: The WebSurfer navigated to the general Ensembl data access page instead of staying on the specific beluga whale page.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions did not clearly specify to stay on the beluga whale page and navigate directly to the 'Downloads' section.\n- **Repetition of Steps**: The WebSurfer repeated the same steps without being directed to correct the navigation issue.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to the Beluga Whale Page**:\n   - WebSurfer should open the specific Ensembl page for beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) again.\n   - Ensure the URL is `https://mart.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index`.\n\n2. **Locate the 'Downloads' Section**:\n   - On the beluga whale page, WebSurfer should scroll down to the 'Downloads' section.\n   - Look for options to download GFF3 files.\n\n3. **Find the Most Recent GFF3 File**:\n   - Identify the GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n   - Verify the release date of the file to ensure it is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n4. **Extract the Direct URL**:\n   - Once the correct GFF3 file is identified, extract the direct download link.\n   - Verify the link to ensure it is functional.\n\n5. **Report the Findings**:\n   - Provide the extracted link to the GFF3 file along with any relevant details (e.g., file name, release date).\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1**: Open the specific Ensembl page for beluga whales.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.open_url('https://mart.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index')\n  ```\n\n- **Step 2**: Scroll down to the 'Downloads' section.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.scroll_to_section('Downloads')\n  ```\n\n- **Step 3**: Locate the GFF3 file and verify the release date.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.find_element_by_text('GFF3 files for genes, cDNAs, ncRNA, proteins')\n  WebSurfer.click_element('GFF3 files for genes, cDNAs, ncRNA, proteins')\n  WebSurfer.wait_for_page_load(5)  # Wait for 5 seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded\n  ```\n\n- **Step 4**: Extract the direct download link.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.find_element_by_text('Download GFF3 file')\n  WebSurfer.extract_attribute('href', 'Download GFF3 file')\n  ```\n\n- **Step 5**: Report the findings.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.summarize_page()\n  ```\n\nPlease execute these steps to find the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020."}

We maintain the Ensembl Archive sites so that there are stable links to data from a particular release. As of December 2016 these will be available for \nfive years, together with the following longer term archives: \nAnnotation on the \nhuman NCBI36 assembly is available at our \nEnsembl 54 archive site.\nAnnotation on the \nmouse NCBIm37 assembly is available at our \nEnsembl 67 archive site.\nAs from August 2014 we are supporting the \nhuman GRCh37 assembly at our dedicated \nGRCh37 human site. Unlike the other Ensembl archive sites, this will be updated to the latest web interface every Ensembl release and there may be occasional data updates to human.\n Archived databases are also maintained for at least 10 years. More information is available from our \nMySQL database documentation. We also maintain data archives from 2004 available from our \nFTP site. \nFor all enquiries, please \ncontact the Ensembl HelpDesk.\nNotes\nEnsembl aims to maintain stable identifiers for genes (ENSG), transcripts (ENST), proteins (ENSP) and exons (ENSE) as long as possible. Changes within the genome sequence assembly or an updated genome annotation may dramatically change a gene model. In these cases, the old set of stable IDs is retired and a new one assigned. Gene and transcript pages both have an ID History view which maps changes in the ID from the earliest version in Ensembl.\nProtein family identifiers (fam), Ensembl EST gene identifiers (ENSESTG) and Genscan identifiers (GENSCAN) are currently not stable.\nWith the exception of the GRCh37 human site \nBLAST, BLAT and other tools are not available from the archive sites.\nAccounts are shared between the current site and almost all archives. The exceptions are the older human NCBI36 and the mouse GRCm37 sites where changes in architecture and code make sharing logins impractical. \nLinking to the Archive Ensembl sites\nThe Archive Ensembl sites have the format: \nhttp://<three-letter-month><year>.archive.ensembl.org for example \nhttp://nov2008.archive.ensembl.org)\nIn the footer of each current Ensembl page, there is a link called 'Permanent link', which links to the corresponding page in the Ensembl Archive. A similar link on each archive page links back to the current site (i.e. www.ensembl.org).\nFor example if you are looking at the Alternative Splicing view for human gene BRCA2 on the \nmain Ensembl site in August 2015, when Ensembl 80 was the current version, the URL would be:\nhttp://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Splice?db=core;g=ENSG00000139618;r=13:31787617-31871809;t=ENST00000380152and the equivalent archived page URL would be:\nhttp://jul2015.archive.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Splice?db=core;g=ENSG00000139618;r=13:31787617-31871809;t=ENST00000380152This website requires cookies, and the limited processing of your personal data in order to function.

Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The date of interest is 20/10/2020.\n   - The file type of interest is a GFF3 file.\n   - The species of interest is the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas).\n   - The Ensembl database contains genomic data for the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas).\n   - The Ensembl release 102 (November 2020) is the closest release to the date of interest (20/10/2020).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific GFF3 file for beluga whales released on or before 20/10/2020.\n   - The exact URL or direct link to the most recent GFF3 file as of 20/10/2020.\n   - The release date of the GFF3 file to verify it is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Verification that the GFF3 file found is indeed the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n   - Cross-referencing the file's release date with the date provided in the request to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The GFF3 file for beluga whales is likely to be hosted on the Ensembl database, given that it is a reputable genomics database and contains data for the beluga whale.\n   - The GFF3 file may be part of a larger dataset or project related to marine mammal genomics.\n   - The file could be associated with a scientific publication or research study that was published around the same time.\n   - The Ensembl FTP site is a likely source for downloading the GFF3 file, as it provides access to complete datasets and databases.\n   - The GFF3 file for the beluga whale in Ensembl release 102 (November 2020) is the most recent file as of 20/10/2020, since it is the closest release to the date of interest.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- Given that the Ensembl page for beluga whales exists and offers various downloads, it is highly likely that the GFF3 file is available there.\n- The Ensembl FTP site is a common and reliable source for downloading large genomic datasets, including GFF3 files.\n- The presence of a specific genome assembly (ASM228892v3) suggests that the data is well-maintained and regularly updated, increasing the likelihood that the most recent file as of 20/10/2020 is available.\n- Since Ensembl release 102 (November 2020) is the closest release to the date of interest (20/10/2020), it is reasonable to assume that the GFF3 file from this release is the most recent one available as of 20/10/2020.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Downloads Section**:\n   - Open the specific Ensembl page for beluga whales in the November 2020 release: https://nov2020.archive.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index.\n   - Scroll down to the 'Downloads' section.\n\n2. **Locate the GFF3 File**:\n   - Look for the GFF3 file for beluga whales.\n   - Verify the release date to ensure it is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n\n3. **Extract the Direct Download Link**:\n   - Once the correct GFF3 file is identified, extract the direct download link.\n   - Verify the link to ensure it is functional.\n\n4. **Report the Findings**:\n   - Provide the extracted link to the GFF3 file along with any relevant details (e.g., file name, release date).\n\nPlease proceed with these steps to find the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Navigation Issue**: The WebSurfer did not successfully navigate to the 'Downloads' section after clicking the 'GFF3' link. This might be due to the page not fully loading or the element not being correctly identified.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions did not clearly specify to wait for the page to fully load after clicking the 'GFF3' link.\n- **Repetition of Steps**: The WebSurfer repeated the same steps without being directed to correct the navigation issue.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Open the Specific Ensembl Page for Beluga Whales**:\n   - Navigate to the Ensembl archive page for beluga whales in the November 2020 release.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.open_url('https://nov2020.archive.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index')\n   ```\n\n2. **Scroll to the 'Downloads' Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the 'Downloads' section to ensure the GFF3 file link is visible.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.scroll_to_section('Downloads')\n   ```\n\n3. **Locate and Click the GFF3 File Link**:\n   - Identify and click the 'GFF3 files for genes, cDNAs, ncRNA, proteins' link.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.find_element_by_text('GFF3 files for genes, cDNAs, ncRNA, proteins')\n   WebSurfer.click_element('GFF3 files for genes, cDNAs, ncRNA, proteins')\n   WebSurfer.wait_for_page_load(5)  # Wait for 5 seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   - Verify the release date of the GFF3 file to ensure it is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.find_element_by_text('Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.102.gff3.gz')\n   WebSurfer.extract_attribute('href', 'Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.102.gff3.gz')\n   ```\n\n5. **Extract the Direct Download Link**:\n   - Extract the direct download link for the GFF3 file.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.extract_attribute('href', 'Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.102.gff3.gz')\n   ```\n\n6. **Report the Findings**:\n   - Provide the extracted link to the GFF3 file along with any relevant details (e.g., file name, release date).\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.summarize_page()\n   ```\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1**: Open the specific Ensembl page for beluga whales.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.open_url('https://nov2020.archive.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index')\n  ```\n\n- **Step 2**: Scroll down to the 'Downloads' section.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.scroll_to_section('Downloads')\n  ```\n\n- **Step 3**: Locate and click the GFF3 file link.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.find_element_by_text('GFF3 files for genes, cDNAs, ncRNA, proteins')\n  WebSurfer.click_element('GFF3 files for genes, cDNAs, ncRNA, proteins')\n  WebSurfer.wait_for_page_load(5)  # Wait for 5 seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded\n  ```\n\n- **Step 4**: Verify the release date.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.find_element_by_text('Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.102.gff3.gz')\n  WebSurfer.extract_attribute('href', 'Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.102.gff3.gz')\n  ```\n\n- **Step 5**: Extract the direct download link.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.extract_attribute('href', 'Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.102.gff3.gz')\n  ```\n\n- **Step 6**: Report the findings.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.summarize_page()\n  ```\n\nPlease execute these steps to find the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020."}

This might be due to the page not fully loading or the element not being correctly identified.\n- **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions did not clearly specify to wait for the page to fully load after clicking the 'GFF3' link.\n- **Repetition of Steps**: The WebSurfer repeated the same steps without being directed to correct the navigation issue.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Open the Specific Ensembl Page for Beluga Whales**:\n   - Navigate to the Ensembl archive page for beluga whales in the November 2020 release.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.open_url('https://nov2020.archive.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index')\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure Full Page Load**:\n   - Wait for the page to fully load before proceeding.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.wait_for_page_load(10)\n   ```\n\n3. **Scroll to the 'Downloads' Section**:\n   - Scroll down to the 'Downloads' section to ensure the GFF3 file link is visible.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.scroll_to_section('Downloads')\n   ```\n\n4. **Locate and Click the GFF3 File Link**:\n   - Identify and click the 'GFF3 files for genes, cDNAs, ncRNA, proteins' link.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.find_element_by_text('GFF3 files for genes, cDNAs, ncRNA, proteins')\n   WebSurfer.click_element('GFF3 files for genes, cDNAs, ncRNA, proteins')\n   WebSurfer.wait_for_page_load(10)  # Wait for 10 seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the Release Date**:\n   - Verify the release date of the GFF3 file to ensure it is the most recent one as of 20/10/2020.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.find_element_by_text('Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.102.gff3.gz')\n   ```\n\n6. **Extract the Direct Download Link**:\n   - Extract the direct download link for the GFF3 file.\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.extract_attribute('href', 'Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.102.gff3.gz')\n   ```\n\n7. **Report the Findings**:\n   - Provide the extracted link to the GFF3 file along with any relevant details (e.g., file name, release date).\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.summarize_page()\n   ```\n\n### Additional Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Ensure Full Page Load**: After each navigation step, explicitly wait for the page to fully load.\n- **Check Element Visibility**: Before interacting with an element, check if it is visible and clickable.\n- **Use Alternative Locators**: If the text-based locator fails, try using other attributes like `id`, `class`, or `xpath`.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1**: Open the specific Ensembl page for beluga whales.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.open_url('https://nov2020.archive.ensembl.org/Delphinapterus_leucas/Info/Index')\n  ```\n\n- **Step 2**: Ensure the page is fully loaded.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.wait_for_page_load(10)\n  ```\n\n- **Step 3**: Scroll down to the 'Downloads' section.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.scroll_to_section('Downloads')\n  ```\n\n- **Step 4**: Locate and click the GFF3 file link.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.find_element_by_text('GFF3 files for genes, cDNAs, ncRNA, proteins')\n  WebSurfer.click_element('GFF3 files for genes, cDNAs, ncRNA, proteins')\n  WebSurfer.wait_for_page_load(10)  # Wait for 10 seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded\n  ```\n\n- **Step 5**: Verify the release date and extract the direct download link.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.find_element_by_text('Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.102.gff3.gz')\n  WebSurfer.extract_attribute('href', 'Delphinapterus_leucas.ASM228892v3.102.gff3.gz')\n  ```\n\n- **Step 6**: Report the findings.\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.summarize_page()\n  ```\n\nPlease execute these steps to find the most recent GFF3 file for beluga whales as of 20/10/2020."}
