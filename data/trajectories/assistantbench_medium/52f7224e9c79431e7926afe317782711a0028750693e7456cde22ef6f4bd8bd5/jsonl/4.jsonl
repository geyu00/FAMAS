I generally love overstated/baroque movies as much as I like overactors (Kinski, Bette Davies, Nic Cage) but Possession goes beyond Gothic, it flaunts itself in violent anarchy even when it knows it&apos;s not being important. It&apos;s a movie in a constant state of violent flux, a chaotic maelstrom of emotion threatening to rip apart at the seams by force of its own negativity, an excess of emotion and abundance of expression. I don&apos;t know what Zulawski is trying to say through the film about his own divorce from wife and country and political system, like Eraserhead it&apos;s something so personal that it pierces through bottoms of the soul to come out at the other end and speak for things that touch all of us.\\n\\nSam Neill and Isabelle Adjani see their marriage come crashing down and the film is not merely the death and burial but the wake before and the mourning after. I don&apos;t like how Zulawski uses Isabelle Adjani to play different characters very calculated to be different sides of the same person, but then again I don&apos;t like movies that do that, it&apos;s like a very easy way to a quick symbolism (Ashes of Time, another film I saw recently, does that too). And I don&apos;t like who the monster turns out to be, for the same reason, and also because the monster, bloody and deformed, is a better parable of all the bile and hatred and oppressed furious anger felt the character who nurses it to life. The symbolism is too clear almost.\\n\\nBut the rest of the film you watch in stupefied silence. Possession is like a woman in the grip of hysterics running around an apartment tossing and breaking things and cutting herself up with a meat knife, arms flailing like an armature of a tentacled beast ready to tear itself out from a human body.\\n\\nWhat Zulawski does here is perfectly illustrated in one scene: the couple have one of their terrible rows in the apartment, the woman storms out, music cue plays then stops, and we get the impression the scene has played out, we expect the cut. But then Zulawski has the camera track behind the man as he chases the woman down the stairs of their apartment and out in the street, pulling at each other and yelling in the middle of an empty intersection, then a truck carrying beatup cars comes rolling by, cars falling crashing down from it. Like the wail of a banshee, Possession is demented and frightful.\\n\\nIt&apos;s a movie that doesn&apos;t happen in the same place as other movies. Sometimes it gets hard for me for example to differentiate the look and feel of one noir from the other, one NYC crime flick from the other. Like Don&apos;t Look Now with its Venetian labyrinths, this has a sense of place and a malevolent presence in that place. It happens in that part of the city where other movies don&apos;t know how to go, the streets are different, the buildings and apartments look curiously different, and when an apartment catches on fire, there&apos;s a strange old woman down in the street corner yelling things about God (&quot;giving the light clear, getting it back dirty&quot;) and cackling maniacally as though an end to the world is very close at hand.\\n\\nBoth Sam Neil and Isabelle Adjani give performances of a lifetime. Neil is going through the motions though, except for his &apos;going mad in a hotel room&apos; scene in the beginning, his madness is external, pantomimed. Isabelle Adjani lives it though, feels and breathes it. She gives perhaps the most outstanding female performance I have ever seen. Her scene in the subway station, all spasmodic intensity and wordless cries, affected me physically like no other, at once monstrous and immensely sad.\\n\\nThis movie is a nervous breakdown and an agnostic lament against an absent indifferent God captured on celluloid. The tagline for the American release reads &quot;She made a monster her secret lover&quot;, but this is not that type of film. This is like few films ever made, before or after, and is done with the ferocity of someone going mad in four walls, now perhaps clawing at the walls with blood and bile and staring at his designs as though there might be pattern and order there.\"\n        },\n        \"aggregateRating\": {\n            \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n            \"ratingCount\": 51319,\n            \"bestRating\": 10,\n            \"worstRating\": 1,\n            \"ratingValue\": 7.3\n        },\n        \"contentRating\": \"R\",\n        \"genre\": [\n            \"Drama\",\n            \"Horror\"\n        ],\n        \"datePublished\": \"1983-10-28\",\n        \"keywords\": \"obsession,dysfunctional marriage,monster,violence,extramarital affair\",\n        \"trailer\": {\n            \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n            \"name\": \"Official Trailer\",\n            \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3084305689/\",\n            \"thumbnail\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"contentUrl\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTBmNDIzZjQtMTZmYS00MGRmLTkzNGItNTcyMTg5YzRhNzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRpZWdtb25n._V1_.jpg\"\n            },\n            \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTBmNDIzZjQtMTZmYS00MGRmLTkzNGItNTcyMTg5YzRhNzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRpZWdtb25n._V1_.jpg\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3084305689/\",\n            \"description\": \"A woman starts exhibiting increasingly disturbing behavior after asking her husband for a divorce.

The story itself is adapted from Alexandre Dumas&apos; novel, which is a pretty highly colored piece to begin with. Chereau theatrically plasters the set with blood and gore, and we are left in no doubt that an atrocity has occurred (the St Bartholomew&apos;s day massacre of the Hugenots.) The mendacious Queen Mother, Catherine di Medici, and her weak-minded son, Charles IX, seem to have set it off to deal with the protestant problem without realizing how bad it might get.\\n\\nIn all this horror is the rather cute tale of the relationship between two disparate personalities thrown together in marriage, Catherine&apos;s daughter Margo and Henry of Navarre (later Henry IV of France, and one of its better kings). Margo is repulsed at first sight by Henry `the peasant&apos; while Henry rightly regards her as about as loving as a trapped tiger. Yet they reach an accommodation and finish up friends. Both have other lovers (and both respect that) but neither can prevent the lovers from coming to sticky ends.\\n\\nIt&apos;s always a bit hard to assess the acting when you are relying on sub-titles (if only the French didn&apos;t speak so fast) but Isabella Adjani at the age of 40 pulled off a remarkable job and had me convinced she really was a spoilt, willful little nymphomaniac in her early 20&apos;s. She looked as young as she did in the `Story of Adele H&apos; 20 years earlier. Daniel Auteuil was also excellent as the unprepossessing but very intense and quick-thinking Henry. Virna Lisi, a sex symbol in her earlier film career, made a good villainess as Catherine. Most of the other principals seem to have been chosen for their looks by rent-an-ego casting though Jean-Huges Anglade was suitably pathetic as the doomed King Charles.\\n\\nThe rather claustrophobic sets brought home the medieval lack of privacy, even (perhaps especially) in royal palaces \\u0096 the old Louvre was about as spacious as the \\u0091loo. The film fades a bit in the second half, but it&apos;s still not a bad story, if at times a bit difficult to follow.  I have to say I found `Elizabeth&apos; more interesting and a lot less bloody.

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours in length.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) for purchase or rental.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of all feature films starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The IMDB ratings for each of these films.\n   - The runtime of each of these films.\n   - The availability of these films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which of the films meets all the criteria: highest IMDB rating, less than 2 hours, and available on Fandango at Home.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on her reputation and the types of roles she has played, it is likely that several of Isabelle Adjani's films are highly rated on IMDB.\n   - Given the variety of her work, it is probable that at least one of her films is under 2 hours in length.\n   - Since Fandango at Home has a wide selection of films, it is reasonable to assume that at least one of her films is available on the platform.\n   - **New Guess**: The film \"Possession\" (1981) is a strong candidate because it has a high IMDB rating (7.3/10) and is a well-known work featuring Isabelle Adjani. However, its runtime is 2 hours and 4 minutes, which exceeds the 2-hour limit. Therefore, we should focus on other films that are shorter.\n\n5. **ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**\n   - From the search on Fandango at Home, we found multiple entries for \"Possession,\" but none of them matched the specific 1981 film starring Isabelle Adjani. This suggests that the 1981 film \"Possession\" might not be available on Fandango at Home.\n   - We need to verify the availability and runtime of other films such as \"La Reine Margot,\" \"Camille Claudel,\" \"Bon Voyage,\" \"Masquerade,\" \"The Tenant,\" \"The World Is Yours,\" \"La Journée de la jupe,\" and \"French Women.\"\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Search for the availability and runtime of \"La Reine Margot,\" \"Camille Claudel,\" \"Bon Voyage,\" \"Masquerade,\" \"The Tenant,\" \"The World Is Yours,\" \"La Journée de la jupe,\" and \"French Women\" on Fandango at Home.\n- Verify the IMDB ratings and runtimes for these films.\n- Identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Search Strategy**: The search for multiple films at once on Fandango at Home was not effective, leading to a cluttered and unhelpful search result.\n2. **Lack of Specificity**: The search terms were too broad, resulting in irrelevant results (e.g., multiple entries for \"Possession\" that did not match the specific film we were looking for).\n3. **Manual Verification Needed**: The availability and runtime of each film need to be manually checked and verified, which was not systematically done.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Terms**:\n   -
