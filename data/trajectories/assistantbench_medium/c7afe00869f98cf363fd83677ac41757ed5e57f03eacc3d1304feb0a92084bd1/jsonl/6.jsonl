{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must star Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of movies starring Daniel Craig.\n   - The IMDB ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The availability of each of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which of Daniel Craig's movies meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability).\n   - The highest IMDB rating among the movies that meet the criteria.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, \"Skyfall\" is a highly-rated Daniel Craig movie, but its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be verified.\n   - \"Kingsman: The Golden Circle,\" while not a James Bond film, is another notable movie starring Daniel Craig, but its runtime and availability on Netflix (US) also need verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify Daniel Craig's Movies:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for a comprehensive list of movies starring Daniel Craig.\n  \n- **Check IMDB Ratings:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to IMDB and find the ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n\n- **Verify Runtime:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to check the runtime of each movie on IMDB.\n\n- **Check Netflix (US) Availability:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search Netflix (US) for the availability of each movie that meets the previous criteria.\n\n- **Determine the Highest Rated Movie:**\n  - Compare the IMDB ratings of the movies that meet all the criteria (less than 150 minutes and available on Netflix US) to identify the highest rated one.\n\n- **Compile and Present the Result:**\n  - Use Assistant to compile the final result and present it clearly."}

I was 14 years old when I attended the spy&apos;s first cinematic outing; over the next couple of years, I read all 14 Ian Fleming novels; and, over the last half a century, I have gone along to the theatre to see each new film as soon as it was released. \\n\\nWhat was new with &quot;Skyfall&quot; is that I managed to see it a week before its general release at a special viewing for cast and crew when all mobiles were taken off us, all of us were searched, and everyone sat through the credits before applauding a brilliant team effort.\\n\\nThe sense of excitement was rewarded by a superb movie. A cracking opening is followed by a powerful song from Adele which is followed by a storyline that is genuinely distinctive from other Bond movies: more intelligible and more intelligent.\\n\\nInstead of the archetypal villain as someone crazed by megalomania, we have an adversary, subtly played by a blond Javier Bardem, who is motivated not just by power and wealth but by a very personal sense of vengeance. Instead of a Bond who easily outwits all foes, we have an agent with some obvious vulnerabilities, both physical and psychological, who does not always get his way. Instead of the usual two Bond girls, effectively we have three: French actress B\\u00e9r\\u00e9nice Marlohe in her first English-speaking part, British actress Naomie Harris in what will prove to be a break-out role, and the redoubtable 77 year old Judi Dench playing M for the seventh time in 17 years.\\n\\nThe film is a triumph for British director Sam Mendes, making his first British movie after such more serious successes as &quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;Road To Perdition&quot; and&quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;.

Tom Hardy takes the reigns this time around as Max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. Along with him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young &apos;&quot;wives&quot; escape from the film&apos;s antagonist.\\n\\nLeading up to the film&apos;s release, many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive, but I am happy to say that this is simply not the case. Yes, the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences, but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that Miller has brought to life. There are some emotional moments. Specifically, with Theron&apos;s character. Is the story something we haven&apos;t seen before? Not at all. But in a film loaded with action, it&apos;s nice to see a solid narrative.\\n\\nNow, how about those action sequences? Incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set-pieces ever. One thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character&apos;s make have an affect on them. For good and for bad. The action is not pointless. It&apos;s motivated. And it&apos;s glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.\\n\\n&apos;Mad Max: Fury Road&apos; has set a new standard for action films. It&apos;s arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. It&apos;s that good. George Miller has brought back what we loved about 80&apos;s action films while also brining new ideas to the table. It&apos;s the best time I&apos;ve had in a theater in a long time, and I couldn&apos;t help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes. The film left me feeling giddy, with a big smile on my face.\",\n            \"reviewRating\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Rating\",\n                \"worstRating\": 1,\n                \"bestRating\": 10,\n                \"ratingValue\": 10\n            }\n        },\n        \"aggregateRating\": {\n            \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n            \"ratingCount\": 1172784,\n            \"bestRating\": 10,\n            \"worstRating\": 1,\n            \"ratingValue\": 8.1\n        },\n        \"contentRating\": \"R\",\n        \"genre\": [\n            \"Action\",\n            \"Adventure\",\n            \"Sci-Fi\"\n        ],\n        \"datePublished\": \"2015-05-14\",\n        \"keywords\": \"post apocalypse,desert,car chase,escape,chase\",\n        \"trailer\": {\n            \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n            \"name\": \"Retaliate\",\n            \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3047862297/\",\n            \"thumbnail\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"contentUrl\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MzkxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQzMTc1NTE@._V1_.jpg\"\n            },\n            \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MzkxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQzMTc1NTE@._V1_.jpg\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3047862297/\",\n            \"description\": \"Watch a trailer for &quot;Mad Max.&quot;\",\n            \"duration\": \"PT2M29S\",\n            \"uploadDate\": \"2015-05-03T13:11:36Z\"\n        },\n        \"actor\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0362766/\",\n                \"name\": \"Tom Hardy\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000234/\",\n                \"name\": \"Charlize Theron\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396558/\",\n                \"name\": \"Nicholas Hoult\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"director\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004306/\",\n                \"name\": \"George Miller\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"creator\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0002663/\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0227121/\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0351258/\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004306/\",\n                \"name\": \"George Miller\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0565068/\",\n                \"name\": \"Brendan McCarthy\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0490147/\",\n                \"name\": \"Nick Lathouris\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"duration\": \"PT2H\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width\",\n        \"description\": \"Mad Max: Fury Road: Directed by George Miller.

I was 14 years old when I attended the spy&apos;s first cinematic outing; over the next couple of years, I read all 14 Ian Fleming novels; and, over the last half a century, I have gone along to the theatre to see each new film as soon as it was released. \\n\\nWhat was new with &quot;Skyfall&quot; is that I managed to see it a week before its general release at a special viewing for cast and crew when all mobiles were taken off us, all of us were searched, and everyone sat through the credits before applauding a brilliant team effort.\\n\\nThe sense of excitement was rewarded by a superb movie. A cracking opening is followed by a powerful song from Adele which is followed by a storyline that is genuinely distinctive from other Bond movies: more intelligible and more intelligent.\\n\\nInstead of the archetypal villain as someone crazed by megalomania, we have an adversary, subtly played by a blond Javier Bardem, who is motivated not just by power and wealth but by a very personal sense of vengeance. Instead of a Bond who easily outwits all foes, we have an agent with some obvious vulnerabilities, both physical and psychological, who does not always get his way.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must star Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of movies starring Daniel Craig.\n   - The IMDB ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The availability of each of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which of Daniel Craig's movies meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability).\n   - The highest IMDB rating among the movies that meet the criteria.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, \"Skyfall\" is a highly-rated Daniel Craig movie, but its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be verified.\n   - \"Casino Royale\" is another highly-rated Daniel Craig movie and is known for its critical acclaim, but its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be verified.\n   - \"Knives Out\" is a well-received movie starring Daniel Craig and is known for its engaging plot and performances, but its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be verified.\n   - \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is a notable movie starring Daniel Craig, but its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be verified.\n   - \"Quantum of Solace\" and \"Spectre\" are part of the James Bond series and are known for their action and plot, but their runtimes and availability on Netflix (US) need to be verified.\n   - \"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\" is a sequel to \"Knives Out\" and features Daniel Craig, but its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be verified.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Skyfall**: Known for its high IMDB rating and critical acclaim, it is a strong candidate, but its availability on Netflix (US) is unknown.\n- **Casino Royale**: Another highly-rated James Bond film that could potentially meet the criteria, but its availability on Netflix (US) is unknown.\n- **Knives Out**: A critically acclaimed mystery film that fits the runtime requirement and could be available on Netflix (US).\n- **The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo**: A well-known thriller that might meet the criteria, but its availability on Netflix (US) is unknown.\n- **Quantum of Solace** and **Spectre**: Part of the James Bond series, these films are known for their action and plot, but their runtimes and availability on Netflix (US) need to be checked.\n- **Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery**: A sequel to \"Knives Out\" that continues to feature Daniel Craig, but its availability on Netflix (US) is unknown.\n\nThese updates should help guide the next steps in verifying the necessary information to find the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie that meets all the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The web surfer navigated to incorrect or irrelevant pages multiple times, leading to a lack of necessary data.\n2. **Incomplete Data Extraction**: Even when the correct pages were accessed, the data extraction was not thorough enough to gather all required information (ratings, runtimes, and Netflix availability).\n3. **Lack of Systematic Approach**: The process lacked a structured approach to ensure that all necessary information was collected and verified step-by-step.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to IMDB Pages Directly**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate directly to the IMDB pages for the following movies: No Time to Die, Casino Royale, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Spectre, Quantum of Solace.\n   - Extract the following information for each movie:\n     - IMDB Rating\n     - Runtime\n     - Check if the movie is available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **Systematic Data Collection**:\n   - For each movie, ensure that the WebSurfer extracts the required information in a structured format.\n   - Use the following URLs to navigate directly to the IMDB pages:\n     - No Time to Die: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3380528/`\n     - Casino Royale: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/`\n     - Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270797/`\n     - The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568346/`\n     - Spectre: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379713/`\n     - Quantum of Solace: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/`\n\n3. **Check Netflix Availability**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Netflix (US) website and search for each movie to verify its availability.\n   - If a movie is available, note it down.\n\n4. **Filter and Determine the Highest Rated Movie**:\n   - Filter the movies that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability).\n   - Identify the highest-rated movie among the filtered list.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Extract Data from IMDB**:\n   - Navigate to the IMDB page for each movie using the provided URLs.\n   - Extract the IMDB rating and runtime for each movie.\n   - Example script for WebSurfer:\n     ```python\n     movies = [\n         {\"title\": \"No Time to Die\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3380528/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Casino Royale\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270797/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568346/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Spectre\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379713/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Quantum of Solace\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/\"}\n     ]\n\n     for movie in movies:\n         web_surfer.navigate(movie[\"url\"])\n         rating = web_surfer.extract_text(\"IMDb RATING\")\n         runtime = web_surfer.extract_text(\"Run Time\")\n         movie[\"rating\"] = float(rating.split(\"/\")[0].strip())\n         movie[\"runtime\"] = int(runtime.split()[0])\n     ```\n\n2. **Check Netflix Availability**:\n   - Navigate to the Netflix (US) website and search for each movie.\n   - Example script for WebSurfer:\n     ```python\n     netflix_url = \"https://www.netflix.com/us/\"\n     web_surfer.navigate(netflix_url)\n\n     for movie in movies:\n         search_box = web_surfer.find_element(\"input\", {\"placeholder\": \"Titles, people, genres\"})\n         search_box.send_keys(movie[\"title\"])\n         search_box.submit()\n         web_surfer.sleep(5)  # Wait for search results to load\n         results = web_surfer.find_elements(\"a\", {\"class\": \"title-card\"})\n         if results:\n             movie[\"netflix_available\"] = True\n         else:\n             movie[\"netflix_available\"] = False\n     ```\n\n3. **Filter and Determine the Highest Rated Movie**:\n   - Filter the movies that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability).\n   - Identify the highest-rated movie among the filtered list.\n   - Example script:\n     ```python\n     valid_movies = [movie for movie in movies if movie[\"runtime\"] < 150 and movie[\"netflix_available\"]]\n     highest_rated_movie = max(valid_movies, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n     print(f\"The highest rated Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and available on Netflix (US) is: {highest_rated_movie['title']} with a rating of {highest_rated_movie['rating']}\")\n     ```\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to systematically collect the necessary data and determine the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie that meets all the criteria."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must star Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of movies starring Daniel Craig.\n   - The IMDB ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - The availability of each of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which of Daniel Craig's movies meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability).\n   - The highest IMDB rating among the movies that meet the criteria.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Skyfall**: Known for its high IMDB rating and critical acclaim, it is a strong candidate, but its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be verified.\n   - **Casino Royale**: Another highly-rated James Bond film that could potentially meet the criteria, but its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be verified.\n   - **Knives Out**: A critically acclaimed mystery film that fits the runtime requirement and could be available on Netflix (US).\n   - **The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo**: A well-known thriller that might meet the criteria, but its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be verified.\n   - **Quantum of Solace**: Part of the James Bond series, this film is known for its action and plot, but its runtime and availability on Netflix (US) need to be checked.\n   - **Spectre**: Another James Bond film, known for its action and plot, but its runtime and availability on Netflix (US) need to be checked.\n   - **Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery**: A sequel to \"Knives Out\" that continues to feature Daniel Craig, but its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be verified.\n   - **No Time to Die**: The latest James Bond film starring Daniel Craig, known for its high production value and critical reception, but its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be verified.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Skyfall**: Known for its high IMDB rating (8.0) and critical acclaim, it is a strong candidate, but its availability on Netflix (US) is unknown.\n- **Casino Royale**: Another highly-rated James Bond film with an IMDB rating of 8.0, it is a strong candidate, but its availability on Netflix (US) is unknown.\n- **Knives Out**: A critically acclaimed mystery film with an IMDB rating of 7.9, it fits the runtime requirement and could be available on Netflix (US).\n- **The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo**: A well-known thriller with an IMDB rating of 7.8, it might meet the criteria, but its availability on Netflix (US) is unknown.\n- **Quantum of Solace**: Part of the James Bond series with an IMDB rating of 6.9, it is known for its action and plot, but its runtime and availability on Netflix (US) need to be checked.\n- **Spectre**: Another James Bond film with an IMDB rating of 6.8, known for its action and plot, but its runtime and availability on Netflix (US) need to be checked.\n- **Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery**: A sequel to \"Knives Out\" with an IMDB rating of 7.8, it continues to feature Daniel Craig, but its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be verified.\n- **No Time to Die**: The latest James Bond film with an IMDB rating of 7.0, known for its high production value and critical reception, but its availability on Netflix (US) needs to be verified.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to IMDB Pages Directly**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate directly to the IMDB pages for the following movies:\n     - No Time to Die: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3380528/`\n     - Casino Royale: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/`\n     - Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270797/`\n     - The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568346/`\n     - Spectre: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379713/`\n     - Quantum of Solace: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/`\n     - Skyfall: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/`\n\n2. **Extract Data from IMDB**:\n   - For each movie, extract the IMDB rating and runtime.\n   - Example script for WebSurfer:\n     ```python\n     movies = [\n         {\"title\": \"No Time to Die\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3380528/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Casino Royale\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270797/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568346/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Spectre\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379713/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Quantum of Solace\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Skyfall\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/\"}\n     ]\n\n     for movie in movies:\n         web_surfer.navigate(movie[\"url\"])\n         rating = web_surfer.extract_text(\"IMDb RATING\")\n         runtime = web_surfer.extract_text(\"Run Time\")\n         movie[\"rating\"] = float(rating.split(\"/\")[0].strip())\n         movie[\"runtime\"] = int(runtime.split()[0])\n     ```\n\n3. **Check Netflix Availability**:\n   - Navigate to the Netflix (US) website and search for each movie to verify its availability.\n   - Example script for WebSurfer:\n     ```python\n     netflix_url = \"https://www.netflix.com/us/\"\n     web_surfer.navigate(netflix_url)\n\n     for movie in movies:\n         search_box = web_surfer.find_element(\"input\", {\"placeholder\": \"Titles, people, genres\"})\n         search_box.send_keys(movie[\"title\"])\n         search_box.submit()\n         web_surfer.sleep(5)  # Wait for search results to load\n         results = web_surfer.find_elements(\"a\", {\"class\": \"title-card\"})\n         if results:\n             movie[\"netflix_available\"] = True\n         else:\n             movie[\"netflix_available\"] = False\n     ```\n\n4. **Filter and Determine the Highest Rated Movie**:\n   - Filter the movies that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability).\n   - Identify the highest-rated movie among the filtered list.\n   - Example script:\n     ```python\n     valid_movies = [movie for movie in movies if movie[\"runtime\"] < 150 and movie[\"netflix_available\"]]\n     highest_rated_movie = max(valid_movies, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n     print(f\"The highest rated Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and available on Netflix (US) is: {highest_rated_movie['title']} with a rating of {highest_rated_movie['rating']}\")\n     ```\n\nBy following this updated plan, we should be able to systematically collect the necessary data and determine the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie that meets all the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The web surfer navigated to the wrong IMDB page for 'No Time to Die' multiple times, likely due to a typo or incorrect URL.\n2. **Timeout Issues**: The web surfer encountered timeout errors while trying to navigate to the IMDB pages, possibly due to network issues or the page taking too long to load.\n3. **JavaScript Requirement**: Some IMDB pages require JavaScript to be enabled, which the web surfer might not support or might not have been properly configured to handle.\n4. **Inconsistent Data Extraction**: The data extraction process was inconsistent, leading to incomplete or incorrect information being gathered.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Verify URLs and Correct Navigation**:\n   - Double-check the URLs for each movie to ensure they are correct.\n   - Manually navigate to each URL to confirm they lead to the correct pages.\n\n2. **Handle JavaScript and Timeout Issues**:\n   - Ensure the web surfer is configured to handle JavaScript.\n   - Increase the timeout duration for page loading to avoid timeout errors.\n\n3. **Systematic Data Collection**:\n   - Extract the IMDB rating and runtime for each movie in a structured format.\n   - Verify the data extraction process to ensure consistency.\n\n4. **Check Netflix Availability**:\n   - Navigate to the Netflix (US) website and search for each movie to verify its availability.\n   - Use a consistent method to check availability, such as looking for the movie title in the search results.\n\n5. **Filter and Determine the Highest Rated Movie**:\n   - Filter the movies that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability).\n   - Identify the highest-rated movie among the filtered list.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Verify URLs**:\n   - Manually verify the URLs for each movie:\n     - No Time to Die: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3380528/`\n     - Casino Royale: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/`\n     - Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270797/`\n     - The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568346/`\n     - Spectre: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379713/`\n     - Quantum of Solace: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/`\n     - Skyfall: `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/` (Note: This URL is repeated, correct it to `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375718/`)\n\n2. **Extract Data from IMDB**:\n   - Navigate to each verified URL and extract the IMDB rating and runtime.\n   - Example script for WebSurfer:\n     ```python\n     movies = [\n         {\"title\": \"No Time to Die\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3380528/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Casino Royale\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270797/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568346/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Spectre\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379713/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Quantum of Solace\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/\"},\n         {\"title\": \"Skyfall\", \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375718/\"}\n     ]\n\n     for movie in movies:\n         web_surfer.navigate(movie[\"url\"])\n         web_surfer.sleep(10)  # Wait for the page to fully load\n         rating = web_surfer.extract_text(\"IMDb RATING\")\n         runtime = web_surfer.extract_text(\"Run Time\")\n         movie[\"rating\"] = float(rating.split(\"/\")[0].strip())\n         movie[\"runtime\"] = int(runtime.split()[0])\n     ```\n\n3. **Check Netflix Availability**:\n   - Navigate to the Netflix (US) website and search for each movie to verify its availability.\n   - Example script for WebSurfer:\n     ```python\n     netflix_url = \"https://www.netflix.com/us/\"\n     web_surfer.navigate(netflix_url)\n     web_surfer.sleep(5)  # Wait for the page to fully load\n\n     for movie in movies:\n         search_box = web_surfer.find_element(\"input\", {\"placeholder\": \"Titles, people, genres\"})\n         search_box.send_keys(movie[\"title\"])\n         search_box.submit()\n         web_surfer.sleep(5)  # Wait for search results to load\n         results = web_surfer.find_elements(\"a\", {\"class\": \"title-card\"})\n         if results:\n             movie[\"netflix_available\"] = True\n         else:\n             movie[\"netflix_available\"] = False\n     ```\n\n4. **Filter and Determine the Highest Rated Movie**:\n   - Filter the movies that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and Netflix availability).\n   - Identify the highest-rated movie among the filtered list.\n   - Example script:\n     ```python\n     valid_movies = [movie for movie in movies if movie[\"runtime\"] < 150 and movie[\"netflix_available\"]]\n     highest_rated_movie = max(valid_movies, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n     print(f\"The highest rated Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and available on Netflix (US) is: {highest_rated_movie['title']} with a rating of {highest_rated_movie['rating']}\")\n     ```\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to avoid the previous issues and successfully determine the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie that meets all the criteria."}
