I will look for any relevant datasets that indicate first sightings in regions such as New Mexico or California.\n\nI'll start by accessing the USGS databases to retrieve the relevant information.

More specifically, in areas like New Mexico, there have been sporadic reports in the mid-1990s. However, precise records from the USGS specifically mentioning the first sighting may require validation from their archives.\n\nTo ensure the information's accuracy, the next step is to directly reference the USGS data or reliable publications to confirm the exact year of the first sighting west of Texas. This might involve accessing specific studies or data repositories.\n\nIf anyone has access to USGS databases, that would expedite our search for accurate data. Would you be able to provide further assistance in accessing those records, or should I attempt to summarize known information until we can validate it?"}
