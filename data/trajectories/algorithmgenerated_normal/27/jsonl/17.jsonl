{"agent": "DataVerification_Expert", "content": "To solve the task, I will follow the plan provided. First, I need to research the world record time for the track “Sweet Sweet Canyon” in 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023. I will utilize the Bing Search API to gather this information. \n\nLet's proceed with the search query to find the relevant world record information. \n\nI'll initiate a search for the world record time for \"Sweet Sweet Canyon\" in \"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe\" 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023. \n\nHere is the code that will help me search for this information:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef search_bing(query):\n    api_key = 'YOUR_BING_SEARCH_API_KEY'\n    search_url = \"https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search\"\n    headers = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": api_key}\n    params = {\"q\": query, \"textDecorations\": True, \"textFormat\": \"HTML\"}\n    response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers, params=params)\n    return response.json()\n\nquery = \"Sweet Sweet Canyon Mario Kart 8 Deluxe 150cc world record time June 7 2023\"\nsearch_results = search_bing(query)\nprint(search_results)\n```\n\nI will need to replace `'YOUR_BING_SEARCH_API_KEY'` with the actual API key. However, since I cannot execute this directly, I'll modify the request to run in the Computer_terminal. \n\nHere's the code that should be executed in the Computer_terminal:\n\n```python\n# filename: search_bing.py\nimport requests\n\ndef search_bing(query):\n    api_key = 'YOUR_BING_SEARCH_API_KEY'  # Replace with your actual API key\n    search_url = \"https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search\"\n    headers = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": api_key}\n    params = {\"q\": query, \"textDecorations\": True, \"textFormat\": \"HTML\"}\n    response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers, params=params)\n    return response.json()\n\nquery = \"Sweet Sweet Canyon Mario Kart 8 Deluxe 150cc world record time June 7 2023\"\nsearch_results = search_bing(query)\nprint(search_results)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code above to find the world record time. Please run it in the Computer_terminal."}
