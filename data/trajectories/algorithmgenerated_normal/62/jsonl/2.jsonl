Retrieve the original article from Project MUSE using the provided DOI.\n2. Locate the quoted text on pages 45-46 of the article.\n3. Compare the quoted text with the in-line citation to check for any discrepancies.\n4. Verify the accuracy of the comparison.\n\n## Output format\n- Answer Yes if the quoted text matches the article.\n- If not, provide the word in the citation that does not match with the correct one (without any article).\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure the original article is retrieved and the quoted text is accurately compared.\n- Provide a clear and concise answer based on the comparison."}
