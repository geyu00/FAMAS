{"agent": "Grocery_Expert", "content": "To assist with the verification process for the supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago that offer ready-to-eat salads for under $15, I will follow the provided plan and break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Verify Menards Classification and Availability of Ready-to-Eat Salads\n\n- **Menards** is primarily known as a home improvement store and may not be classified as a supermarket in the traditional sense. However, they do carry a selection of grocery items, including ready-to-eat salads. \n- I will verify if they currently have the Bumble Bee速 Ready-to-Eat Chicken Salad Kit and Starkist速 Ready-to-Eat Tuna Salad Kit in stock and if they are under $15.\n\n### Step 2: Confirm Prices and Availability at Whole Foods Market\n\n- Whole Foods Market is generally recognized for offering a range of fresh and organic products, including ready-to-eat salads. I will confirm their current price point of around $10.99 for individual portions.\n\n### Step 3: Confirm Prices and Availability at Costco\n\n- Costco is a membership warehouse that sells groceries in bulk. I will check the various salad options available, especially focusing on the Udon-Noodle Salad priced at $12.99 for 2 lbs, as well as confirm the pricing of salads priced between $3.49 and $5.99 per pound.\n\nI'll start with checking the availability and prices at these supermarkets through a Python script, allowing me to verify their current stock levels and pricing. \n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef check_supermarket_availability(supermarket_url):\n    response = requests.get(supermarket_url)\n    return response.json()  # Assuming the API returns JSON data with products and prices.\n\n# URLs for the supermarkets\nwhole_foods_url = \"http://api.wholefoods.com/v1/products\"  # Hypothetical API endpoint for Whole Foods\ncostco_url = \"http://api.costco.com/v1/products\"  # Hypothetical API endpoint for Costco\nmenards_url = \"http://api.menards.com/v1/products\"  # Hypothetical API endpoint for Menards\n\n# Check availability\nwhole_foods_data = check_supermarket_availability(whole_foods_url)\ncostco_data = check_supermarket_availability(costco_url)\nmenards_data = check_supermarket_availability(menards_url)\n\nprint(\"Whole Foods Data:\", whole_foods_data)\nprint(\"Costco Data:\", costco_data)\nprint(\"Menards Data:\", menards_data)\n```\n\nI will run this code to gather information about the prices and availability of ready-to-eat salads in these supermarkets. \n\nNext, I will use the Computer_terminal to execute this code."}
