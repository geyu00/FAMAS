This report is largely based on the works of the late Diarmuid O Muirthe, whom this paper is dedicated to. The ability of reviving languages has become more and more possible with the help of the internet, and by following in the footsteps of other revived languages. This begs the question of if the Forth and Bargy dialect of South East Wexford can be revived. In this report, I will hope to answer this question. \n Introduction \n Yola has been dead for over two hundred years. But this has not stopped linguists from attempting to reconstruct, revive and study the language, as has been done most famously with Hebrew and Cornish. The Yola language, also called the Forth and Bargy dialect, is a mix of Flemish, Welsh, Irish Gaelic, and of course, English. These influences come from the many colonists that have occupied the areas over the many centuries. \n Phonology \n The major phonological differences between the Yola language and standard English phonologically is its use of the letter V and F and how vowels are pronounced when compared to standard English. Whilst English speakers would say fade, found, or free. This would be replaced by a /v/ in Yola, Where it would be pronounced /vaa-de/ voound/ and /vree/ respectively.(although it would still be written with a F). The great vowel shift, which has been written extensively about, was a period of time from 1400 to 1700 when English vowels started to be pronounced differently. Yola did not undergo these changes due to its secluded nature from other English speaking areas. For example, /i/ would have been pronounced /ee/ during this period. And we would not have the short /i/ that exists in modern English, like in the word bite. Aswell, The way /th/ is pronounced in Yola is more of a /d/ or a /dh/. \n Culturally \n There are some recovered documents from the time when the Yola language was commonly spoken in the baronies. The most famous of which are the “Yola Hurling Zong” and “The Maiden of Rosslare”. But through these limited manuscripts we are able to understand how the Yoles behaved, and how they were different compared to the rest of Ireland. The Yoles were isolated both linguistically and physically. They praticed many traditions that were not used outside of Ireland including mumming. According to Diarmuid O Murithe, they “rarely married outside of their territory.”⁶ The Yoles had very strong Norman ties, they used “peelers” which was a cooking utensil used for making bread. \n History of the Yola language \n Through my research on the language. I have came up with an idea about a “Proto-Yola” language. Since it is evdient that languages evolve over time, the most resonable thing to assume is that Yola too evolved. Although it was isolated, the Yola language took up many Irish loanwords over time. The “Proto-Yola” language was first theoretically born when the Norman invasion of the area first started. Over time this new language took on Irish, Welsh, English, and Flemish influences due to its repeated colonization. This is evident through their arcitecture aswell.¹ The language ceased to be a communal one in the baronies of Forth and Bargy sometime in the mid 1850’s, although this is not because of the Irish potato famine and its after effects. The last “true” speaker of the ancient language was a fisherman by the name of Jack Devereux, he was a well respected man in the Kilmore Christmas carolers. A group of men that sang in Yola during the Christmas season. They are still active, but their tradition is nowhere as alive as it was hundreds of years ago. The main modern authority on the Yola language was the famous Irish scholar Diarmuid O Muirithe. Who with singer and songwriter Paddy Berry broadcasted the first well known reconstructed Yola song.² The song in question is about a 1600’s hurling match. \n Jack Devereux \n The last speaker of this ancient dialect was a man by the name of Jack Devereux as I have said before. He was the leader of the Kilmore Christmas Carolers, and was the last person to have a command of the language. Yola still survives in these carols, but it has been mostly overtaken by English. His descendants are still active in the Kilmore Caroling community. ^4. He was one of the people interviewed by Dairmuid O Murithe for his report on the Yola language. Where Murithe discovered that there were “sub-dialects” within Yola.³ The quote in question is, “The two speakers are not from the same place.” D (Jack Deverux) is from Kilmore Quay and J (Liz Jeffreys) is from Neavestown, 10 miles away. There are differences in pronunciation between the two…” Mr. Murithe then goes on to explain the phonological difference between the two speakers. Mainly /dis/ and /jis/ and how Jack Devereaux uses a dental plosive for /dis/ and Liz Jeffreys does not. \n The Normans and the Flemish \n The first people to speak a Proto version of Yola were most likely the Normans and the Flemish. After a flood in the 1100’s settlers moved into the South-East Corner of what is now the baronies of Bargy and Forth. This Proto-Yola language was a dialect of Middle English with Irish and Flemish loanwords most likely. It is very obvious that the Yoles are descended from the Normans, common last names like “Devereaux ‘’ and “Roche ‘’. After the Flemish were displaced from their land due to the flood, they quickly assimilated into their society. Adding Dutch words. A theory of why /zi/ and /aɹs/ are so common in the Yola language is because of this. Many traditions from Normandy came to the Yoles, such as the practice of Mumming, which is a type of acting, usually for a holiday. \n Revitalization \n Language revitalization is an option for the Yola Language. It has already been started by an organization called Gabble Ing Yola.⁵ A “memrise” course is in its early development; it as of August 2022 has roughly 200 words. Although these steps are small, more and more effort is being made to revive Yola language and culture. There was a farmstead in Fiveacre near Tagoat that attempted to reconstruct Yola architecture. The place is still in use as a youth group, exposing young people to their roots.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe Latin root of the Yola word \"gimlie\" shares a spelling with a Spanish word. What is the Google translation of the source title for the 1994 example sentence for that word in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online? Answer in plain text, without punctuation.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request involves a word \"gimlie\" from the Yola language.\n   - The Latin root of \"gimlie\" shares a spelling with a Spanish word.\n   - The 1994 example sentence for this word is in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online.\n   - We need to find the Google translation of the source title for this example sentence.\n   - The Yola word \"gimlie\" means \"chimney\" and is derived from Middle English \"chimeney,\" Old French \"cheminee,\" and Late Latin \"camināta.\"\n   - The Spanish word \"chimenea\" means \"chimney\" and shares the same Latin root \"camināta.\"\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact 1994 example sentence for the word \"chimenea\" in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online.\n   - The source title of the 1994 example sentence.\n   - The Google translation of the source title.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The relationship between the Yola word \"gimlie\" and its Latin root is established through the etymology provided by Wiktionary.\n   - The relevance of the 1994 date to the example sentence in the Collins dictionary is to identify a specific usage or context of the word \"chimenea\" in that year.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The 1994 example sentence might be from a notable source or publication, which could help identify the title. This is based on the assumption that dictionaries often use well-known texts or publications for example sentences.\n   - The source title could be from a literary work, news article, or other significant text from 1994 that used the word \"chimenea\" in a context relevant to its meaning as a chimney.\n\n### Explanation of Updates\n- **Verified Facts**: Added the etymology of \"gimlie\" and the corresponding Spanish word \"chimenea\" to the verified facts section, as this information was confirmed from reliable sources.\n- **Facts to Look Up**: Updated to specifically look for the 1994 example sentence and its source title in the Collins dictionary.\n- **Facts to Derive**: Clarified the relationship between \"gimlie\" and its Latin root, and noted the importance of the 1994 date for identifying the example sentence.\n- **Educated Guesses**: Maintained the guess about the notable source of the 1994 example sentence and added a hypothesis that the source title could be from a literary or significant text, which is a common practice in dictionaries.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Incorrect Search Term**: The search term \"gimlie\" was repeatedly used instead of \"chimenea\" in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary, leading to no results.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: The search for the 1994 example sentence was not focused enough, and the steps to extract the source title were not clearly defined.\n- **Repetition of Mistakes**: The same incorrect search term was used multiple times, despite knowing the correct term (\"chimenea\").\n\n### New Plan\n- **Correct Search Term**: Use \"chimenea\" in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary search.\n- **Specific Steps for Extraction**:\n  - Navigate to the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online.\n  - Search for \"chimenea\".\n  - Identify the 1994 example sentence.\n  - Extract the source title of the 1994 example sentence.\n- **Google Translation**:\n  - Use Google Translate to translate the extracted source title into English.\n- **Final Answer**:\n  - Provide the translated source title in plain text, without punctuation.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **Navigate to Collins Dictionary**:\n   - Open the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online.\n2. **Search for \"chimenea\"**:\n   - Type \"chimenea\" into the search bar and press Enter.\n3. **Identify the 1994 Example Sentence**:\n   - Scroll through the results to find the 1994 example sentence.\n   - Note the exact text of the example sentence.\n4. **Extract the Source Title**:\n   - Locate the source title associated with the 1994 example sentence.\n   - Copy the source title.\n5. **Translate the Source Title**:\n   - Open Google Translate.\n   - Paste the source title into Google Translate.\n   - Translate the title from Spanish to English.\n6. **Provide the Final Answer**:\n   - Compile the translated source title.\n   - Provide the answer in plain text, without punctuation.\n\n### Execution\n- **Step 1**: WebSurfer, navigate to the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online.\n- **Step 2**: WebSurfer, search for \"chimenea\".\n- **Step 3**: WebSurfer, identify the 1994 example sentence and note the exact text.\n- **Step 4**: WebSurfer, extract the source title of the 1994 example sentence.\n- **Step 5**: WebSurfer, open Google Translate and translate the source title from Spanish to English.\n- **Step 6**: Assistant, provide the translated source title in plain text, without punctuation."}
