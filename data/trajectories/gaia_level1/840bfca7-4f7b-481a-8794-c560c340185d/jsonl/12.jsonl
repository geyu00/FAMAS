In 1984, astronomer Farhad Yusef-Zadeh at Northwestern University and his collaborators were \nthe first to observe these wispy trails. Now, they know of more than a thousand of them. They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

However, these aren't vertical. Instead, they lie along the galactic plane and radiate away like spokes on a wheel. \"It was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole,\" Yusef-Zadeh said. \"We have always been thinking about vertical filaments and their origin. I'm used to them being vertical. I never considered there might be others along the plane.\"\nHe and the team were stunned when they saw these radially stretched structures. \"We had to do a lot of work to establish that we weren't fooling ourselves,\" he said. \"And we found that these filaments are not random but appear to be tied to the outflow of our black hole. By studying them, we could learn more about the black hole's spin and accretion disk orientation. It is satisfying when one finds order in a middle of a chaotic field of the nucleus of our galaxy.\"\nYusef-Zadeh pointed out that something clearly occurred in the core to create the short radial filaments. \"We think they must have originated with some kind of outflow from an activity that happened a few million years ago,\" he said. \"It seems to be the result of an interaction of that outflowing material with objects near it.\"\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Then, it \"burps out\" an energetic, highly magnetized blast of energy and plasma. That seems the most likely explanation for the appearance of the bubbles and filaments. It's possible that such a jet collided with clouds of gas and dust in the immediate neighborhood. It could have led to twisted magnetic structures that form the filaments.\nAnother idea is that molecular gas got stretched by the expansion of the material near the core. That somehow creates the radial filaments. Such action would also explain the lopsided appearance of the Sgr E complex. It lies to one side of the black hole at the intersection of the central molecular zone and a wide central dust lane. Finally, it's also possible that the gravitational potential of our galaxy's central bar is tugging the Sgr E cloud. That could play a role in forming those filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

That could play a role in forming those filaments.\nThe vertical ones pose a different challenge to understand. They tower up to 150 light-years above the plane of the galaxy. Yusef-Zadeh and his team suggest a couple of ideas for their existence. The first is cosmic-ray pressure forcing filaments into a vertical orientation. That pressure is the aftermath of the explosive event a few million years ago that created the bubbles.\nSome verticals could be the result of the interaction of a large-scale wind in the region and obstacles embedded within the flow. That combination creates filaments by wrapping the wind's magnetic field around the obstacles. Clearly, there's a lot of observation work and analysis to be done in order to really understand what's happening to create both sets of filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

That combination creates filaments by wrapping the wind's magnetic field around the obstacles. Clearly, there's a lot of observation work and analysis to be done in order to really understand what's happening to create both sets of filaments.\nDifferent Types of Filaments, Milky-Way Style\nTheir origins likely explain the radically different orientations and characteristics of each filament population. The vertical filaments are perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy and stretch up to around 150 light-years in length, while the horizontal ones are parallel to the plane and are only about 5 to 10 light-years long. The horizontals point radially toward the center of the galaxy where Sgr A* lies. The vertical ones are magnetic and relativistic (meaning their particles are moving near the speed of light). The horizontal filaments appear to emit thermal (warm) radiation and seem to be accelerating warmed material in a molecular cloud. There are just a few hundred of these horizontal filaments seen so far.\nThe vertical filaments appear around the nucleus of the galaxy while the horizontal ones spread out to only one side. According to Yusef-Zadeh, the radial outflows are somewhat lopsided. That may give some clues about the black hole region itself. \"One of the most important implications of radial outflow that we have detected is the orientation of the accretion disk and the jet-driven outflow from Sagittarius A* along the galactic plane,\" he said.\nLooking at the Filaments through Time\nWhile the radial filaments Yusef-Zadeh and his team found are a more recent discovery, the vertical ones are old friends. There are nearly a thousand of them grouped in pairs and clusters. Yusef-Zadeh says they are about 6 million years old.\nHe's been studying odd structures in the galactic core for decades. In 1984, he worked with astronomers Mark Morris and Don Chance to make a Very Large Array radio map of the galactic center in the 20-cm wavelength band when they first found the vertical structures. The emissions they detected came from nonthermally emitting (i.e. cool) gas arranged along magnetic structures.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Then, it \"burps out\" an energetic, highly magnetized blast of energy and plasma. That seems the most likely explanation for the appearance of the bubbles and filaments. It's possible that such a jet collided with clouds of gas and dust in the immediate neighborhood. It could have led to twisted magnetic structures that form the filaments.\nAnother idea is that molecular gas got stretched by the expansion of the material near the core. That somehow creates the radial filaments. Such action would also explain the lopsided appearance of the Sgr E complex. It lies to one side of the black hole at the intersection of the central molecular zone and a wide central dust lane. Finally, it's also possible that the gravitational potential of our galaxy's central bar is tugging the Sgr E cloud. That could play a role in forming those filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Yusef-Zadeh and his team suggest a couple of ideas for their existence. The first is cosmic-ray pressure forcing filaments into a vertical orientation. That pressure is the aftermath of the explosive event a few million years ago that created the bubbles.\nSome verticals could be the result of the interaction of a large-scale wind in the region and obstacles embedded within the flow.

That combination creates filaments by wrapping the wind's magnetic field around the obstacles. Clearly, there's a lot of observation work and analysis to be done in order to really understand what's happening to create both sets of filaments.\nDifferent Types of Filaments, Milky-Way Style\nTheir origins likely explain the radically different orientations and characteristics of each filament population. The vertical filaments are perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy and stretch up to around 150 light-years in length, while the horizontal ones are parallel to the plane and are only about 5 to 10 light-years long. The horizontals point radially toward the center of the galaxy where Sgr A* lies. The vertical ones are magnetic and relativistic (meaning their particles are moving near the speed of light). The horizontal filaments appear to emit thermal (warm) radiation and seem to be accelerating warmed material in a molecular cloud. There are just a few hundred of these horizontal filaments seen so far.\nThe vertical filaments appear around the nucleus of the galaxy while the horizontal ones spread out to only one side. According to Yusef-Zadeh, the radial outflows are somewhat lopsided. That may give some clues about the black hole region itself. \"One of the most important implications of radial outflow that we have detected is the orientation of the accretion disk and the jet-driven outflow from Sagittarius A* along the galactic plane,\" he said.\nLooking at the Filaments through Time\nWhile the radial filaments Yusef-Zadeh and his team found are a more recent discovery, the vertical ones are old friends. There are nearly a thousand of them grouped in pairs and clusters. Yusef-Zadeh says they are about 6 million years old.\nHe's been studying odd structures in the galactic core for decades. In 1984, he worked with astronomers Mark Morris and Don Chance to make a Very Large Array radio map of the galactic center in the 20-cm wavelength band when they first found the vertical structures. The emissions they detected came from nonthermally emitting (i.e. cool) gas arranged along magnetic structures.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

That could play a role in forming those filaments.\nThe vertical ones pose a different challenge to understand. They tower up to 150 light-years above the plane of the galaxy. Yusef-Zadeh and his team suggest a couple of ideas for their existence. The first is cosmic-ray pressure forcing filaments into a vertical orientation. That pressure is the aftermath of the explosive event a few million years ago that created the bubbles.\nSome verticals could be the result of the interaction of a large-scale wind in the region and obstacles embedded within the flow. That combination creates filaments by wrapping the wind's magnetic field around the obstacles. Clearly, there's a lot of observation work and analysis to be done in order to really understand what's happening to create both sets of filaments.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Clearly, there's a lot of observation work and analysis to be done in order to really understand what's happening to create both sets of filaments.\nDifferent Types of Filaments, Milky-Way Style\nTheir origins likely explain the radically different orientations and characteristics of each filament population. The vertical filaments are perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy and stretch up to around 150 light-years in length, while the horizontal ones are parallel to the plane and are only about 5 to 10 light-years long. The horizontals point radially toward the center of the galaxy where Sgr A* lies. The vertical ones are magnetic and relativistic (meaning their particles are moving near the speed of light). The horizontal filaments appear to emit thermal (warm) radiation and seem to be accelerating warmed material in a molecular cloud. There are just a few hundred of these horizontal filaments seen so far.\nThe vertical filaments appear around the nucleus of the galaxy while the horizontal ones spread out to only one side. According to Yusef-Zadeh, the radial outflows are somewhat lopsided. That may give some clues about the black hole region itself. \"One of the most important implications of radial outflow that we have detected is the orientation of the accretion disk and the jet-driven outflow from Sagittarius A* along the galactic plane,\" he said.\nLooking at the Filaments through Time\nWhile the radial filaments Yusef-Zadeh and his team found are a more recent discovery, the vertical ones are old friends. There are nearly a thousand of them grouped in pairs and clusters. Yusef-Zadeh says they are about 6 million years old.\nHe's been studying odd structures in the galactic core for decades. In 1984, he worked with astronomers Mark Morris and Don Chance to make a Very Large Array radio map of the galactic center in the 20-cm wavelength band when they first found the vertical structures. The emissions they detected came from nonthermally emitting (i.e. cool) gas arranged along magnetic structures.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
