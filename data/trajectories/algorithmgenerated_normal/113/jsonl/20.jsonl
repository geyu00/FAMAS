Focus on the trails mentioned in the search results which are known for their waterfalls.\n2. Extract information about the number of reviews and average rating from TripAdvisor and other review platforms.\n3. Analyze the reviews for mentions of wheelchair accessibility.\n\nI will now write Python code to:\n- Parse the review pages for the mentioned trails.\n- Extract the number of reviews and average ratings.\n- Look for mentions of \"wheelchair accessible\" in the reviews.\n\nLet’s proceed to extract this information programmatically. I'll create a structured plan and code to follow up on this.\n\n### Plan\n1. Scrape the review pages for the mentioned trails.\n2. Extract the necessary details (number of reviews, average rating, accessibility mentions).\n3. Verify the criteria.\n\n### Step-by-step Code:\n1. **Scrape Review Pages**:\n   We can use BeautifulSoup to scrape the review pages.\n\n2. **Extract Information**:\n   Extract number of reviews, average rating, and mentions of accessibility.\n\n3. **Verify Criteria**:\n   Validate trails against the given criteria.\n\nLet’s start with the initial part of scraping review pages and extracting information.\n\n### Python Code for Scraping:\n```python\n# filename: yosemite_trail_scraper.py\n\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ntrail_urls = [\n    \"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g61000-Activities-c61-t87-Yosemite_National_Park_California.html\",\n    \"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g61000-Activities-c57-t95-Yosemite_National_Park_California.html\",\n    \"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g61000-d483482-Reviews-Mist_Trail-Yosemite_National_Park_California.html\",\n]\n\ndef get_trail_info(trail_url):\n    response = requests.get(trail_url)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n    \n    # Find the number of reviews and average rating\n    number_of_reviews = int(soup.find('span', class_='reviewCount').text.replace(',', ''))\n    average_rating = float(soup.find('span', class_='ui_bubble_rating')['alt'].split()[0])\n    \n    # Find mentions of \"wheelchair accessible\" in the reviews\n    reviews = soup.find_all('div', class_='review-container')\n    accessibility_mentions = sum(1 for review in reviews if 'wheelchair accessible' in review.text.lower())\n    \n    return {\n        \"number_of_reviews\": number_of_reviews,\n        \"average_rating\": average_rating,\n        \"accessibility_mentions\": accessibility_mentions\n    }\n\ntrail_data = []\nfor url in trail_urls:\n    trail_data.append(get_trail_info(url))\n\nprint(trail_data)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code to gather information about the trails and then we can move on to the analysis part."}
