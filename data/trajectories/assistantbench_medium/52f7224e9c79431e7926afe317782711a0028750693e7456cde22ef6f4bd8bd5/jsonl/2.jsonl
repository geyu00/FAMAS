{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDB ratings for Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, so it's likely that one of her films meets the criteria.\n   - Popular streaming platforms like Fandango at Home often carry a wide selection of classic and contemporary films, increasing the likelihood that a highly-rated Adjani film is available.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify and List Isabelle Adjani's Feature Films**: Use WebSurfer to search for a comprehensive list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films, including their IMDB ratings and runtimes.\n- **Filter by Runtime**: From the list obtained, filter out films that are 2 hours or longer.\n- **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**: For the remaining films, use WebSurfer to check their availability on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n- **Determine the Highest-Rated Film**: Among the films that meet all criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home), identify the one with the highest IMDB rating.\n- **Verify and Confirm**: Double-check the final selection to ensure all criteria are met and provide the answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n   - Isabelle Adjani has been in a significant number of films, many of which are critically acclaimed.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDB ratings for Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, so it's likely that one of her films meets the criteria.\n   - Popular streaming platforms like Fandango at Home often carry a wide selection of classic and contemporary films, increasing the likelihood that a highly-rated Adjani film is available.\n   - Given her extensive filmography, it is reasonable to assume that some of her films are less than 2 hours long and have high IMDB ratings.\n   - Some of her well-known films, such as \"Possession\" (1981), \"Camille Claudel\" (1988), and \"La Reine Margot\" (1994), are likely to be available on major streaming platforms due to their critical acclaim and popularity.\n\n5. **NEW INFORMATION**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has a diverse filmography, including roles in both French and international productions.\n   - Some of her notable films include \"Possession\" (IMDB rating: 7.3), \"Camille Claudel\" (IMDB rating: 7.3), and \"La Reine Margot\" (IMDB rating: 7.7).\n   - We need to verify the runtimes of these films and their availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n**REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **Highly Rated Films**: Based on the known IMDB ratings, \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) has a high rating of 7.7, making it a strong candidate. However, we need to confirm its runtime and availability.\n- **Runtime Verification**: Many of her films, especially the more recent ones, are likely to be under 2 hours, but we need to verify this.\n- **Platform Availability**: Given the popularity of her films, it is likely that at least one of her highly-rated films is available on Fandango at Home.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Verify the runtimes of \"Possession,\" \"Camille Claudel,\" and \"La Reine Margot.\"\n2. Check the availability of these films on Fandango at Home.\n3. Identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Scrolling and Data Collection**:\n   - The process of scrolling down the IMDb page to gather information was inefficient and did not yield a complete list of Isabelle Adjani's films, their ratings, and runtimes.\n   - The focus on scrolling without a structured approach led to missing important data.\n\n2. **Lack of Structured Data Extraction**:\n   - There was no systematic way to extract and organize the data collected from the IMDb page.\n   - The data needed to be structured in a way that allows easy filtering and comparison.\n\n3. **Incomplete Verification**:\n   - The verification of film runtimes and availability on Fandango at Home was not performed systematically.\n   - This led to a lack of concrete information to make a final decision.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Structured Data Collection**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDb page.\n   - **Step 2**: Scroll down the page to collect a list of all feature films, including their titles, IMDB ratings, and release years.\n   - **Step 3**: Use WebSurfer to click on each film's title to navigate to its individual IMDb page and extract the runtime.\n   - **Step 4**: Store the collected data in a structured format (e.g., a CSV file or a Python dictionary).\n\n2. **Filtering and Verification**:\n   - **Step 5**: Filter the list to include only films that are less than 2 hours long.\n   - **Step 6**: Use WebSurfer to check the availability of the filtered films on Fandango at Home.\n   - **Step 7**: Store the availability information in the structured data format.\n\n3. **Identifying the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - **Step 8**: Sort the filtered and verified list by IMDB rating in descending order.\n   - **Step 9**: Identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n4. **Final Verification and Confirmation**:\n   - **Step 10**: Double-check the final selection to ensure all criteria are met.\n   - **Step 11**: Provide the answer with the film's title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to IMDb Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the IMDb page for Isabelle Adjani.\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.open_url(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Collect Film Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down the page to collect a list of all feature films, including titles, IMDB ratings, and release years.\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.scroll_down(5)\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"film titles, IMDB ratings, release years\")\n     ```\n\n3. **Extract Runtime for Each Film**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on each film's title to navigate to its individual IMDb page and extract the runtime.\n     ```sh\n     for film in film_list:\n         WebSurfer.click_link(film['title'])\n         WebSurfer.extract_text(\"runtime\")\n         WebSurfer.navigate_back()\n     ```\n\n4. **Store Data in Structured Format**:\n   - **Python**: Store the collected data in a Python dictionary or CSV file.\n     ```python\n     film_data = []\n     for film in film_list:\n         film_data.append({\n             'title': film['title'],\n             'rating': film['rating'],\n             'runtime': film['runtime'],\n             'year': film['year']\n         })\n     ```\n\n5. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - **Python**: Filter the list to include only films that are less than 2 hours long.\n     ```python\n     filtered_films = [film for film in film_data if int(film['runtime'].split()[0]) < 120]\n     ```\n\n6. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check the availability of the filtered films on Fandango at Home.\n     ```sh\n     for film in filtered_films:\n         WebSurfer.search(film['title'] + \" Fandango at Home\")\n         WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     ```\n\n7. **Sort by IMDB Rating**:\n   - **Python**: Sort the filtered and verified list by IMDB rating in descending order.\n     ```python\n     sorted_films = sorted(filtered_films, key=lambda x: float(x['rating']), reverse=True)\n     ```\n\n8. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - **Python**: Identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n     ```python\n     highest_rated_film = sorted_films[0]\n     ```\n\n9. **Final Verification and Confirmation**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Double-check the final selection to ensure all criteria are met.\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.open_url(highest_rated_film['title'] + \" Fandango at Home\")\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     ```\n\n10. **Provide the Answer**:\n    - **Python**: Provide the answer with the film's title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n      ```python\n      print(f\"The highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and available on Fandango at Home is '{highest_rated_film['title']}' with an IMDB rating of {highest_rated_film['rating']}, runtime of {highest_rated_film['runtime']}, and it is available for rent or purchase.\")\n      ```\n\nBy following this structured plan, we can efficiently gather the necessary data, filter it, and identify the highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that meets all the criteria."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n   - Isabelle Adjani has been in a significant number of films, many of which are critically acclaimed.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDB ratings for Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, so it's likely that one of her films meets the criteria.\n   - Popular streaming platforms like Fandango at Home often carry a wide selection of classic and contemporary films, increasing the likelihood that a highly-rated Adjani film is available.\n   - Given her extensive filmography, it is reasonable to assume that some of her films are less than 2 hours long and have high IMDB ratings.\n   - Some of her well-known films, such as \"Possession\" (1981), \"Camille Claudel\" (1988), and \"La Reine Margot\" (1994), are likely to be available on major streaming platforms due to their critical acclaim and popularity.\n   - \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) has a high IMDB rating of 7.7, making it a strong candidate. However, we need to confirm its runtime and availability.\n\n5. **NEW INFORMATION**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has a diverse filmography, including roles in both French and international productions.\n   - Some of her notable films include:\n     - \"Possession\" (1981) - IMDB rating: 7.3\n     - \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) - IMDB rating: 7.3\n     - \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) - IMDB rating: 7.7\n   - We need to verify the runtimes of these films and their availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:\n- **Highly Rated Films**: \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) has a high rating of 7.7, making it a strong candidate. However, we need to confirm its runtime and availability.\n- **Runtime Verification**: Many of her films, especially the more recent ones, are likely to be under 2 hours, but we need to verify this.\n- **Platform Availability**: Given the popularity of her films, it is likely that at least one of her highly-rated films is available on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Verify Runtimes**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the individual IMDb pages of \"Possession,\" \"Camille Claudel,\" and \"La Reine Margot\" to extract their runtimes.\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.open_url(\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082778/\")  # Possession\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"runtime\")\n     WebSurfer.open_url(\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094567/\")  # Camille Claudel\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"runtime\")\n     WebSurfer.open_url(\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110447/\")  # La Reine Margot\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"runtime\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the availability of these films on Fandango at Home.\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.search(\"Possession Fandango at Home\")\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     WebSurfer.search(\"Camille Claudel Fandango at Home\")\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     WebSurfer.search(\"La Reine Margot Fandango at Home\")\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     ```\n\n3. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - **Python**: Filter the list to include only films that are less than 2 hours long and available on Fandango at Home. Sort the filtered list by IMDB rating in descending order.\n     ```python\n     film_data = [\n         {'title': 'Possession', 'rating': 7.3, 'runtime': 120, 'available': True},\n         {'title': 'Camille Claudel', 'rating': 7.3, 'runtime': 120, 'available': True},\n         {'title': 'La Reine Margot', 'rating': 7.7, 'runtime': 150, 'available': True}\n     ]\n     filtered_films = [film for film in film_data if film['runtime'] < 120 and film['available']]\n     sorted_films = sorted(filtered_films, key=lambda x: x['rating'], reverse=True)\n     highest_rated_film = sorted_films[0] if sorted_films else None\n     ```\n\n4. **Final Verification and Confirmation**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Double-check the final selection to ensure all criteria are met.\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.open_url(highest_rated_film['title'] + \" Fandango at Home\")\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     ```\n\n5. **Provide the Answer**:\n   - **Python**: Provide the answer with the film's title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n     ```python\n     if highest_rated_film:\n         print(f\"The highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and available on Fandango at Home is '{highest_rated_film['title']}' with an IMDB rating of {highest_rated_film['rating']}, runtime of {highest_rated_film['runtime']} minutes, and it is available for rent or purchase.\")\n     else:\n         print(\"No Isabelle Adjani feature film meets all the criteria.\")\n     ```\n\nBy following this structured plan, we can efficiently gather the necessary data, filter it, and identify the highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that meets all the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Data Collection**:\n   - The previous attempts to scroll and extract data from the IMDb page were not systematic, leading to incomplete data collection.\n   - The focus on scrolling without a structured approach led to missing important information such as runtimes and availability.\n\n2. **Lack of Structured Data Storage**:\n   - The data collected was not stored in a structured format, making it difficult to filter and compare the films based on the required criteria.\n\n3. **Incomplete Verification**:\n   - The verification of film runtimes and availability on Fandango at Home was not performed systematically, leading to incomplete information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to IMDb Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the IMDb page for Isabelle Adjani.\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.open_url(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Collect Film Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down the page to collect a list of all feature films, including titles, IMDB ratings, and release years.\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.scroll_down(10)\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"film titles, IMDB ratings, release years\")\n     ```\n\n3. **Extract Runtime for Each Film**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each film, navigate to its individual IMDb page and extract the runtime.\n     ```sh\n     for film in film_list:\n         WebSurfer.open_url(f\"https://www.imdb.com/title/{film['id']}/\")\n         WebSurfer.extract_text(\"runtime\")\n         WebSurfer.navigate_back()\n     ```\n\n4. **Store Data in Structured Format**:\n   - **Python**: Store the collected data in a Python dictionary or CSV file.\n     ```python\n     film_data = []\n     for film in film_list:\n         film_data.append({\n             'title': film['title'],\n             'rating': film['rating'],\n             'runtime': film['runtime'],\n             'year': film['year'],\n             'id': film['id']\n         })\n     ```\n\n5. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - **Python**: Filter the list to include only films that are less than 2 hours long.\n     ```python\n     filtered_films = [film for film in film_data if int(film['runtime'].split()[0]) < 120]\n     ```\n\n6. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each filtered film, search for its availability on Fandango at Home.\n     ```sh\n     for film in filtered_films:\n         WebSurfer.search(f\"{film['title']} Fandango at Home\")\n         WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     ```\n\n7. **Store Availability Information**:\n   - **Python**: Update the film data with availability information.\n     ```python\n     for film in filtered_films:\n         film['available'] = availability_check(film['title'])\n     ```\n\n8. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - **Python**: Sort the filtered and verified list by IMDB rating in descending order.\n     ```python\n     sorted_films = sorted(filtered_films, key=lambda x: float(x['rating']), reverse=True)\n     highest_rated_film = sorted_films[0] if sorted_films else None\n     ```\n\n9. **Final Verification and Confirmation**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Double-check the final selection to ensure all criteria are met.\n     ```sh\n     if highest_rated_film:\n         WebSurfer.open_url(f\"{highest_rated_film['title']} Fandango at Home\")\n         WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     ```\n\n10. **Provide the Answer**:\n    - **Python**: Provide the answer with the film's title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n      ```python\n      if highest_rated_film:\n          print(f\"The highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and available on Fandango at Home is '{highest_rated_film['title']}' with an IMDB rating of {highest_rated_film['rating']}, runtime of {highest_rated_film['runtime']} minutes, and it is available for rent or purchase.\")\n      else:\n          print(\"No Isabelle Adjani feature film meets all the criteria.\")\n      ```\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Systematic Data Collection**: Ensure that each step of data collection is systematic and thorough. Use structured methods to extract and store data.\n- **Structured Data Storage**: Use Python dictionaries or CSV files to store the collected data in a structured format, making it easier to filter and compare.\n- **Complete Verification**: Perform a complete verification of film runtimes and availability on Fandango at Home for each film that meets the initial criteria.\n- **Double-Check Final Selection**: Ensure that the final selected film meets all the criteria by double-checking the information.\n\nBy following this new plan, we can avoid the previous issues and efficiently gather the necessary data to identify the highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that meets all the criteria."}

Actress: Possession. Isabelle Yasmine Adjani was born in Gennevilliers, Hauts-de-Seine, a suburb of Paris, to Emma Augusta &quot;Gusti&quot; (Schweinberger) and Mohammed Adjani.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n- The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n- The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n- The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n- Isabelle Adjani has been in a significant number of films, many of which are critically acclaimed.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The IMDB ratings for Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n- The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n- The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, so it's likely that one of her films meets the criteria.\n- Popular streaming platforms like Fandango at Home often carry a wide selection of classic and contemporary films, increasing the likelihood that a highly-rated Adjani film is available.\n- Given her extensive filmography, it is reasonable to assume that some of her films are less than 2 hours long and have high IMDB ratings.\n- Some of her well-known films, such as \"Possession\" (1981), \"Camille Claudel\" (1988), and \"La Reine Margot\" (1994), are likely to be available on major streaming platforms due to their critical acclaim and popularity.\n- \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) has a high IMDB rating of 7.7, making it a strong candidate. However, we need to confirm its runtime and availability.\n\n#### 5. NEW INFORMATION\n- Isabelle Adjani has a diverse filmography, including roles in both French and international productions.\n- Some of her notable films include:\n  - \"Possession\" (1981) - IMDB rating: 7.3\n  - \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) - IMDB rating: 7.3\n  - \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) - IMDB rating: 7.7\n- We need to verify the runtimes of these films and their availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:\n- **Highly Rated Films**: \"La Reine Margot\" (1994) has a high rating of 7.7, making it a strong candidate. However, we need to confirm its runtime and availability.\n- **Runtime Verification**: Many of her films, especially the more recent ones, are likely to be under 2 hours, but we need to verify this.\n- **Platform Availability**: Given the popularity of her films, it is likely that at least one of her highly-rated films is available on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Verify Runtimes**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the individual IMDb pages of \"Possession,\" \"Camille Claudel,\" and \"La Reine Margot\" to extract their runtimes.\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.open_url(\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082778/\")  # Possession\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"runtime\")\n     WebSurfer.open_url(\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094567/\")  # Camille Claudel\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"runtime\")\n     WebSurfer.open_url(\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110447/\")  # La Reine Margot\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"runtime\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the availability of these films on Fandango at Home.\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.search(\"Possession Fandango at Home\")\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     WebSurfer.search(\"Camille Claudel Fandango at Home\")\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     WebSurfer.search(\"La Reine Margot Fandango at Home\")\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     ```\n\n3. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - **Python**: Filter the list to include only films that are less than 2 hours long and available on Fandango at Home. Sort the filtered list by IMDB rating in descending order.\n     ```python\n     film_data = [\n         {'title': 'Possession', 'rating': 7.3, 'runtime': 120, 'available': True},\n         {'title': 'Camille Claudel', 'rating': 7.3, 'runtime': 120, 'available': True},\n         {'title': 'La Reine Margot', 'rating': 7.7, 'runtime': 150, 'available': True}\n     ]\n     filtered_films = [film for film in film_data if film['runtime'] < 120 and film['available']]\n     sorted_films = sorted(filtered_films, key=lambda x: x['rating'], reverse=True)\n     highest_rated_film = sorted_films[0] if sorted_films else None\n     ```\n\n4. **Final Verification and Confirmation**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Double-check the final selection to ensure all criteria are met.\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.open_url(highest_rated_film['title'] + \" Fandango at Home\")\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     ```\n\n5. **Provide the Answer**:\n   - **Python**: Provide the answer with the film's title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n     ```python\n     if highest_rated_film:\n         print(f\"The highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and available on Fandango at Home is '{highest_rated_film['title']}' with an IMDB rating of {highest_rated_film['rating']}, runtime of {highest_rated_film['runtime']} minutes, and it is available for rent or purchase.\")\n     else:\n         print(\"No Isabelle Adjani feature film meets all the criteria.\")\n     ```\n\n### Additional Hunches:\n- **Runtime of \"La Reine Margot\"**: Given that \"La Reine Margot\" is a historical epic, it is likely to be longer than 2 hours. However, we should still verify this.\n- **Availability of Lesser-Known Films**: Some lesser-known but critically acclaimed films might also meet the criteria. We should consider checking films like \"L'histoire d'Adèle H.\" (1975) and \"Nosferatu - Phantom der Nacht\" (1979).\n\nBy following this structured plan, we can efficiently gather the necessary data, filter it, and identify the highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that meets all the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Data Collection**:\n   - The previous attempts to scroll and extract data from the IMDb page were not systematic, leading to incomplete data collection.\n   - The focus on scrolling without a structured approach led to missing important information such as runtimes and availability.\n\n2. **Lack of Structured Data Storage**:\n   - The data collected was not stored in a structured format, making it difficult to filter and compare the films based on the required criteria.\n\n3. **Incomplete Verification**:\n   - The verification of film runtimes and availability on Fandango at Home was not performed systematically, leading to incomplete information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to IMDb Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the IMDb page for Isabelle Adjani.\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.open_url(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Collect Film Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down the page to collect a list of all feature films, including titles, IMDB ratings, and release years.\n     ```sh\n     WebSurfer.scroll_down(10)\n     WebSurfer.extract_text(\"film titles, IMDB ratings, release years\")\n     ```\n\n3. **Extract Runtime for Each Film**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each film, navigate to its individual IMDb page and extract the runtime.\n     ```sh\n     for film in film_list:\n         WebSurfer.open_url(f\"https://www.imdb.com/title/{film['id']}/\")\n         WebSurfer.extract_text(\"runtime\")\n         WebSurfer.navigate_back()\n     ```\n\n4. **Store Data in Structured Format**:\n   - **Python**: Store the collected data in a Python dictionary or CSV file.\n     ```python\n     film_data = []\n     for film in film_list:\n         film_data.append({\n             'title': film['title'],\n             'rating': film['rating'],\n             'runtime': film['runtime'],\n             'year': film['year'],\n             'id': film['id']\n         })\n     ```\n\n5. **Filter by Runtime**:\n   - **Python**: Filter the list to include only films that are less than 2 hours long.\n     ```python\n     filtered_films = [film for film in film_data if int(film['runtime'].split()[0]) < 120]\n     ```\n\n6. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each filtered film, search for its availability on Fandango at Home.\n     ```sh\n     for film in filtered_films:\n         WebSurfer.search(f\"{film['title']} Fandango at Home\")\n         WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     ```\n\n7. **Store Availability Information**:\n   - **Python**: Update the film data with availability information.\n     ```python\n     for film in filtered_films:\n         film['available'] = availability_check(film['title'])\n     ```\n\n8. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - **Python**: Sort the filtered and verified list by IMDB rating in descending order.\n     ```python\n     sorted_films = sorted(filtered_films, key=lambda x: float(x['rating']), reverse=True)\n     highest_rated_film = sorted_films[0] if sorted_films else None\n     ```\n\n9. **Final Verification and Confirmation**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Double-check the final selection to ensure all criteria are met.\n     ```sh\n     if highest_rated_film:\n         WebSurfer.open_url(f\"{highest_rated_film['title']} Fandango at Home\")\n         WebSurfer.extract_text(\"availability\")\n     ```\n\n10. **Provide the Answer**:\n    - **Python**: Provide the answer with the film's title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n      ```python\n      if highest_rated_film:\n          print(f\"The highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and available on Fandango at Home is '{highest_rated_film['title']}' with an IMDB rating of {highest_rated_film['rating']}, runtime of {highest_rated_film['runtime']} minutes, and it is available for rent or purchase.\")\n      else:\n          print(\"No Isabelle Adjani feature film meets all the criteria.\")\n      ```\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Systematic Data Collection**: Ensure that each step of data collection is systematic and thorough. Use structured methods to extract and store data.\n- **Structured Data Storage**: Use Python dictionaries or CSV files to store the collected data in a structured format, making it easier to filter and compare.\n- **Complete Verification**: Perform a complete verification of film runtimes and availability on Fandango at Home for each film that meets the initial criteria.\n- **Double-Check Final Selection**: Ensure that the final selected film meets all the criteria by double-checking the information.\n- **Use IDs for Films**: Use the IMDb IDs for films to ensure accurate navigation and data extraction.\n- **Handle Edge Cases**: Be prepared to handle edge cases where data might not be available or formatted as expected."}
