Output the names of those members.\n\nHere's the suggested code for when the CSV data is available:\n\n```python\n# filename: validate_fubo_management.py\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the CSV file\nfile_path = 'path_to_your_file.csv'  # Please replace with the actual path to your CSV file\ndata = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n\n# Check the contents of the DataFrame\nprint(data.head())\n\n# Filter members who joined in the year 2020\nmembers_joined_2020 = data[data['joining_year'] == 2020]['name'].tolist()\n\n# Print the names of the members who joined in 2020\nprint(members_joined_2020)\n```\n\nOnce you provide the actual CSV file path or confirm the structure of the data, I can modify the script accordingly and execute it to retrieve and validate the results.
