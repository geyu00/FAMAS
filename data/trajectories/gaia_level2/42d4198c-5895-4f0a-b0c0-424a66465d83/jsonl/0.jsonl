Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The task involves finding the Wikipedia page for this game.\n   - The number of revisions to the Wikipedia page before the month listed as the game's release date needs to be determined.\n   - The release date should be taken from the most recent entry on the Wikipedia page as of 2022.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards.\n   - The Wikipedia page for the identified game.\n   - The release date of the game as listed on the Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022).\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page for the game.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of revisions to the Wikipedia page before the month of the game's release date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019 is likely to be a well-known and critically acclaimed title.\n   - The release date of the game is probably well-documented on its Wikipedia page.\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page can be accessed through the page's history tab.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the 2019 British Academy Games Award Winner**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for the 2019 British Academy Games Awards winner.\n  - Note the name of the winning game.\n\n- **Find the Wikipedia Page for the Game**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page for the identified game.\n  - Verify the release date of the game as listed on the Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022).\n\n- **Determine the Number of Revisions Before the Release Month**\n  - Use WebSurfer to access the revision history of the Wikipedia page.\n  - Identify the month of the game's release date.\n  - Count the number of revisions made to the page before the month of the release date.\n\n- **Report the Results**\n  - Summarize the findings, including the name of the game, the release date, and the number of revisions before the release month."}

The game was released worldwide for the \nPlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a \nWindows port released in January 2022. It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are basically 2 protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature.

Barlog released the overture as a thank you to fans for \nGod of War's E3 2016 trailer reaching fifteen million views on YouTube.\n[71]Release[edit]The game was released worldwide on April 20, 2018, for the PlayStation 4.\n[51] In addition to the standard base game, there were three special editions: the Stone Mason Edition, the Collector's Edition, and the Digital Deluxe Edition. The Stone Mason Edition was only available in the United States and Canada and came with several physical items, including: the base game in a SteelBook case, a 9-inch (230 mm) statue of Kratos and Atreus created by Gentle Giant, 2-inch (51 mm) carvings of the Huldra Brothers, a horse, and a troll, an exclusive \nlithograph, a cloth map, a \nstonemason's ring, and a keychain of Mímir's head that talks. There was a variety of \ndownloadable content (DLC), including an exclusive shield skin, as well as an armor set and another shield skin for Kratos, a PlayStation 4 dynamic theme, a digital artbook, and \nGod of War #0 by \nDark Horse Comics.\n[72] The Collector's Edition came with many of the same items, minus the ring, the keychain, the carvings of the horse and troll, and the exclusive shield skin. The Digital Deluxe Edition came with all the digital content, minus the exclusive shield skin. U.S. and Canadian customers also received a Kratos and Atreus \npin for pre-ordering the Digital Deluxe Edition. Pre-orders at select retailers received three skins for Kratos's shield. Pre-orders from \nGameStop or \nEB Games also received the \"Luck of Ages XP Talisman\", granting increased XP and Hacksilver gains and increased ability to trigger perks.\n[73]In addition to the special editions of the game, a Limited Edition PlayStation 4 Pro bundle was available the same day as the game's release. The bundle included the standard base game, a PlayStation 4 Pro console decorated with the runes on Kratos's axe, and a similarly themed \nDualShock 4 controller with the \nGod of War logo.\n[74] Additionally, an official \ntabletop \ncard game titled \nGod of War: The Card Game was released by \nCMON Limited on October 25, 2019. Created by Alexandru Olteanu and Fel Barros, players take on the role of the \nNorns, the \nFates of Norse mythology, as they try to prevent Ragnarök with different combinations of characters and events from the game, providing many variations to completing the card game.\n[75][76][77]Prior to launch, Barlog confirmed that \nGod of War would not have \nmicrotransactions, a feature that had become prominent with other games and criticized.\n[78] He also confirmed that the game would not have post-release DLC, like an \nexpansion pack. He said he had pitched an idea for DLC, \"but it was too ambitious\". His idea was similar in scope to that of \nThe Last of Us: Left Behind (2014) and \nUncharted: The Lost Legacy (2017), large standalone expansions for \nThe Last of Us (2013) and \nUncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016), respectively. He said it would have been too big to be DLC, warranting its own standalone release.\n[79]Post-launch, Santa Monica supported the game with \npatch updates to address \nsoftware bugs. As well, the developers added new features along with these free updates. A Photo Mode was released as part of update patch 1.20 on May 9, 2018. It allows players to take customized in-game screenshots. Players can adjust the field of view, depth of view, filters, borders, the visibility of characters, and the ability to change the facial expressions of Kratos and Atreus.\n[80] A \nNew Game Plus mode was released as part of update patch 1.30 on August 20, 2018. To access the mode, players must have completed the game at any difficulty level. The mode itself can be played at any difficulty, but enemies are at a higher level with new maneuvers. All obtained items carry over to New Game Plus, and there are new resources to further upgrade gear, which also have new rarity levels. The option to skip cutscenes was also added.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019 is \"God of War\" (2018).\n   - The task involves finding the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018).\n   - The number of revisions to the Wikipedia page before the month listed as the game's release date needs to be determined.\n   - The release date of \"God of War\" (2018) is April 20, 2018, as listed on the Wikipedia page.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018).\n   - The number of revisions to the Wikipedia page before April 2018.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of revisions to the Wikipedia page before the month of April 2018.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019 is likely to be a well-known and critically acclaimed title, which has been verified as \"God of War\" (2018).\n   - The release date of the game is well-documented on its Wikipedia page, and it is listed as April 20, 2018.\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page can be accessed through the page's history tab, and it will provide the necessary data to count the number of revisions before April 2018.\n   - The revision history might show a significant number of edits due to the high interest and anticipation surrounding the game before its release.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n- **Navigate to the Wikipedia Page for \"God of War\" (2018)**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018).\n- **Access the Revision History**\n  - Use WebSurfer to access the revision history of the Wikipedia page.\n- **Count the Number of Revisions Before April 2018**\n  - Identify the revisions made before April 2018 and count them.\n- **Report the Results**\n  - Summarize the findings, including the name of the game, the release date, and the number of revisions before the release month.\n\nCan you navigate to the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018) and access the revision history to count the number of revisions made before April 2018?\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: The previous attempts involved navigating to the \"Edit\" section of the Wikipedia page, which led to an edit page rather than the main article or revision history.\n- **Blocked IP Address**: The IP address used to access the Wikipedia page was globally blocked, preventing any edits or direct access to certain sections. However, this block should not affect viewing the main article or the revision history.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Navigate Directly to the Main Article**:\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate directly to the main Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018).\n- **Access the Revision History**:\n  - From the main article, click on the \"View history\" tab to access the revision history.\n- **Count Revisions Before April 2018**:\n  - Scroll through the revision history and count the number of revisions made before April 2018.\n- **Report the Results**:\n  - Summarize the findings, including the name of the game, the release date, and the number of revisions before the release month.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the Main Article**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018).\n   - URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\n\n2. **Access the Revision History**:\n   - Once on the main article page, locate and click on the \"View history\" tab.\n\n3. **Count Revisions Before April 2018**:\n   - Scroll through the revision history to identify revisions made before April 2018.\n   - Count the number of revisions.\n\n4. **Report the Results**:\n   - Summarize the findings, including the name of the game, the release date, and the number of revisions before the release month.\n\nCan you navigate to the main Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018) and follow these steps?"}

The game was released worldwide for the \nPlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a \nWindows port released in January 2022. It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are basically 2 protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019 is \"God of War\" (2018).\n   - The task involves finding the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018).\n   - The number of revisions to the Wikipedia page before the month listed as the game's release date needs to be determined.\n   - The release date of \"God of War\" (2018) is April 20, 2018, as listed on the Wikipedia page.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018).\n   - The number of revisions to the Wikipedia page before April 2018.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of revisions to the Wikipedia page before the month of April 2018.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019 is likely to be a well-known and critically acclaimed title, which has been verified as \"God of War\" (2018).\n   - The release date of the game is well-documented on its Wikipedia page, and it is listed as April 20, 2018.\n   - The revision history of the Wikipedia page can be accessed through the page's history tab, and it will provide the necessary data to count the number of revisions before April 2018.\n   - The revision history might show a significant number of edits due to the high interest and anticipation surrounding the game before its release.\n   - Given the popularity and anticipation of \"God of War\" (2018), the number of revisions before its release date could be quite high, potentially in the hundreds.\n\n### Updated Plan:\n- **Navigate to the Wikipedia Page for \"God of War\" (2018)**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018).\n- **Access the Revision History**\n  - Use WebSurfer to access the revision history of the Wikipedia page.\n- **Count the Number of Revisions Before April 2018**\n  - Identify the revisions made before April 2018 and count them.\n- **Report the Results**\n  - Summarize the findings, including the name of the game, the release date, and the number of revisions before the release month.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the Main Article**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018).\n   - URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\n\n2. **Access the Revision History**:\n   - Once on the main article page, locate and click on the \"View history\" tab.\n\n3. **Count Revisions Before April 2018**:\n   - Scroll through the revision history to identify revisions made before April 2018.\n   - Count the number of revisions.\n\n4. **Report the Results**:\n   - Summarize the findings, including the name of the game, the release date, and the number of revisions before the release month.\n\nCan you navigate to the main Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018) and follow these steps? Specifically, can you access the revision history and count the number of revisions made before April 2018?\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Excessive Context Length**: The previous attempt to generate a response failed due to the context length exceeding the model's maximum capacity (32,768 tokens). This is likely because the revision history of the Wikipedia page is extensive, and attempting to process it all at once caused the error.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Break Down the Task**: To avoid overwhelming the model, we will break down the task into smaller, manageable steps.\n- **Use WebSurfer Efficiently**: We will use WebSurfer to navigate and interact with the page, focusing on specific sections of the revision history at a time.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the Main Article**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018).\n   - URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\n\n2. **Access the Revision History**:\n   - Click on the \"View history\" tab to access the revision history.\n\n3. **Scroll Through the Revision History**:\n   - Scroll through the revision history in smaller increments (e.g., one page at a time) to count the number of revisions before April 2018.\n   - Keep track of the count manually or use a script to automate the counting process.\n\n4. **Count Revisions Before April 2018**:\n   - Identify the revisions made before April 20, 2018.\n   - Count the number of revisions.\n\n5. **Report the Results**:\n   - Summarize the findings, including the name of the game, the release date, and the number of revisions before the release month.\n\n### Specific Instructions:\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Main Article**:\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 2: Access the Revision History**:\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.click(\"View history\")\n  ```\n\n- **Step 3: Scroll Through the Revision History**:\n  - Scroll down in smaller increments and count the revisions.\n  - Use the following command to scroll down one page at a time:\n  ```sh\n  WebSurfer.scroll_down()\n  ```\n\n- **Step 4: Count Revisions Before April 2018**:\n  - Manually count the revisions or use a script to automate the counting process.\n  - Stop counting once you reach revisions dated April 2018 or later.\n\n- **Step 5: Report the Results**:\n  - Summarize the findings and report the total number of revisions before April 2018.\n\nCan you start by navigating to the main Wikipedia page for \"God of War\" (2018) and then accessing the revision history?"}

It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are basically 2 protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and \ngods of the Norse world.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"God of War (2018 video game)\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2016-06-14T19:06:41Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-16T13:09:35Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"headline\": \"2018 action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by Santa Monica Studio\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"853\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"God of War (2018 video game) - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
