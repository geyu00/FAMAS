What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The location or database where the most relevant dog genome files can be accessed as of May 2020.\n   - These details can be found on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website, specifically in the Canis lupus familiaris (dog) genome section.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files in May 2020 are likely to be part of a recent update to the dog genome, possibly the CanFam3.1 or a newer version if one was released by then.\n   - The NCBI or Ensembl databases are likely to host the most up-to-date and relevant genome files.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the most relevant dog genome assembly version as of May 2020**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find the most relevant dog genome assembly version and its release date as of May 2020.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the NCBI or Ensembl database to locate the specific version of the dog genome assembly.\n\n- **Locate the download link for the relevant genome files**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Once the correct version is identified, navigate to the download page for that specific version.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n\n- **Verify the link and provide the final answer**:\n  - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the link is active and points to the correct files.\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the version of the genome and the download link."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe dog genome was first mapped in 2004 and has been updated several times since. What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The location or database where the most relevant dog genome files can be accessed as of May 2020.\n   - These details can be found on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website, specifically in the Canis lupus familiaris (dog) genome section, or on the Ensembl database.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files in May 2020 are likely to be part of a recent update to the dog genome, possibly the CanFam3.1 or a newer version if one was released by then. Given the timeline, CanFam3.1 (released in 2011) was a significant update, but there might have been more recent updates by May 2020.\n   - The NCBI or Ensembl databases are likely to host the most up-to-date and relevant genome files. Ensembl, in particular, is known for maintaining the latest versions of genome assemblies.\n   - The Dog10K project, which aims to sequence 10,000 canid genomes, might have contributed to more recent and relevant genome assemblies. This project could have provided updates or improvements to the dog genome by May 2020.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **CanFam3.1 and Later Updates**: While CanFam3.1 was a significant milestone, the rapid advancements in genomics suggest that there could have been more recent updates by May 2020. Checking the latest releases on both NCBI and Ensembl will help confirm this.\n- **Ensembl Database**: Ensembl is known for its comprehensive and up-to-date genomic data. It is a reliable source for the most recent and relevant genome assemblies.\n- **Dog10K Project**: This project, which aims to sequence a large number of canid genomes, could have contributed to more detailed and accurate genome assemblies by May 2020. This project's contributions should be considered when identifying the most relevant files.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Navigate to Ensembl**: Search for the most relevant dog genome assembly version and its release date as of May 2020.\n2. **Check NCBI**: If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, check the NCBI database for the most recent dog genome assembly as of May 2020.\n3. **Extract Download Link**: Once the correct version is identified, navigate to the download page for that specific version and extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The search for the dog genome assembly version and release date as of May 2020 was not directed to the correct section of the Ensembl or NCBI websites. Instead, it led to a general search page or a different species page.\n2. **Lack of Specificity**: The search terms used were too broad, leading to irrelevant results or redirects.\n3. **Access Issues**: There was a temporary block on accessing the NCBI website, which prevented us from checking that resource.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Direct Search on Ensembl**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate directly to the Ensembl homepage (https://www.ensembl.org/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search bar to search for \"Canis lupus familiaris\" to find the dog genome section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n\n2. **Check Specific Assembly Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once on the dog genome page, locate the section that lists the different assembly versions.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Find the release date for each version and identify the most relevant version as of May 2020.\n\n3. **Locate Download Links**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the download page for the identified version.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n\n4. **Fallback to NCBI**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, navigate to the NCBI homepage (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search bar to search for \"Canis lupus familiaris genome assembly\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020 and locate the download link.\n\n5. **Ensure Access**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If access to NCBI is blocked, try again later or use a different search term to avoid the block.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the block persists, focus on Ensembl and ensure all necessary information is gathered from there.\n\n6. **Summarize and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the version of the dog genome assembly and the direct download link.\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the version of the genome and the download link.\n\n### Steps to Follow:\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to https://www.ensembl.org/.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Canis lupus familiaris\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the download page for the identified version.\n- **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n- **WebSurfer**: If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, navigate to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and repeat the search process.\n- **WebSurfer**: Summarize the version and download link.\n- **Assistant**: Compile and provide the final answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe dog genome was first mapped in 2004 and has been updated several times since. What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n   - Ensembl and NCBI are key databases for accessing genome assemblies.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The location or database where the most relevant dog genome files can be accessed as of May 2020.\n   - The exact release date and version number of the dog genome assembly as of May 2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Most Relevant Version**: The most relevant files in May 2020 are likely to be part of a recent update to the dog genome, possibly the CanFam3.1 or a newer version if one was released by then. Given the timeline, CanFam3.1 (released in 2011) was a significant update, but there might have been more recent updates by May 2020.\n   - **Ensembl Database**: Ensembl is known for its comprehensive and up-to-date genomic data. It is a reliable source for the most recent and relevant genome assemblies. The most recent version as of May 2020 is likely to be available on Ensembl.\n   - **NCBI Database**: NCBI is another reliable source for genome assemblies. If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, NCBI should be checked for the most recent dog genome assembly as of May 2020.\n   - **Dog10K Project**: The Dog10K project, which aims to sequence 10,000 canid genomes, might have contributed to more recent and relevant genome assemblies. This project could have provided updates or improvements to the dog genome by May 2020.\n   - **Version Number**: Based on the timeline and the rapid advancements in genomics, it is reasonable to assume that a version more recent than CanFam3.1 was available by May 2020. The version number is likely to be CanFam3.1 or a subsequent version, such as CanFam3.1.2 or CanFam3.2.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **CanFam3.1 and Later Updates**: While CanFam3.1 was a significant milestone, the rapid advancements in genomics suggest that there could have been more recent updates by May 2020. Checking the latest releases on both NCBI and Ensembl will help confirm this.\n- **Ensembl Database**: Ensembl is known for its comprehensive and up-to-date genomic data. It is a reliable source for the most recent and relevant genome assemblies.\n- **NCBI Database**: NCBI is another reliable source for genome assemblies. If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, NCBI should be checked for the most recent dog genome assembly as of May 2020.\n- **Dog10K Project**: This project, which aims to sequence a large number of canid genomes, could have contributed to more detailed and accurate genome assemblies by May 2020. This project's contributions should be considered when identifying the most relevant files.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Navigate to Ensembl**:\n   - Go to the Ensembl homepage (https://www.ensembl.org/).\n   - Use the search bar to search for 'Canis lupus familiaris'.\n   - Identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n   - Navigate to the download page for that version and extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n\n2. **Check NCBI**:\n   - If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, go to the NCBI homepage (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).\n   - Use the search bar to search for 'Canis lupus familiaris genome assembly'.\n   - Identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n   - Navigate to the download page for that version and extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n\n3. **Extract Download Link**:\n   - Once the correct version is identified, navigate to the download page for that specific version.\n   - Extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n\n4. **Summarize and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - Summarize the version of the dog genome assembly and the direct download link.\n   - Compile and provide the final answer, including the version of the genome and the download link.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to https://www.ensembl.org/ and search for 'Canis lupus familiaris'.\n- **WebSurfer**: Identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the download page for the identified version.\n- **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n- **WebSurfer**: If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, navigate to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and repeat the search process.\n- **WebSurfer**: Summarize the version and download link.\n- **Assistant**: Compile and provide the final answer.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The search for the dog genome assembly version and release date as of May 2020 was not directed to the correct section of the Ensembl or NCBI websites. Instead, it led to a general search page or a different species page.\n2. **Lack of Specificity**: The search terms used were too broad, leading to irrelevant results or redirects.\n3. **Access Issues**: There was a temporary block on accessing the NCBI website, which prevented us from checking that resource.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Direct Search on Ensembl**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Ensembl homepage (https://www.ensembl.org/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search bar to search for \"Canis lupus familiaris\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the download page for the identified version.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n\n2. **Check Specific Assembly Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once on the dog genome page, locate the section that lists the different assembly versions.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Find the release date for each version and identify the most relevant version as of May 2020.\n\n3. **Fallback to NCBI**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, navigate to the NCBI homepage (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search bar to search for \"Canis lupus familiaris genome assembly\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the download page for the identified version.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n\n4. **Ensure Access**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If access to NCBI is blocked, try again later or use a different search term to avoid the block.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the block persists, focus on Ensembl and ensure all necessary information is gathered from there.\n\n5. **Summarize and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the version of the dog genome assembly and the direct download link.\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final answer, including the version of the genome and the download link.\n\n### Steps to Follow:\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to https://www.ensembl.org/.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Canis lupus familiaris\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the download page for the identified version.\n- **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n- **WebSurfer**: If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, navigate to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and repeat the search process.\n- **WebSurfer**: Summarize the version and download link.\n- **Assistant**: Compile and provide the final answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe dog genome was first mapped in 2004 and has been updated several times since. What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n   - Ensembl and NCBI are key databases for accessing genome assemblies.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The location or database where the most relevant dog genome files can be accessed as of May 2020.\n   - The exact release date and version number of the dog genome assembly as of May 2020.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Most Relevant Version**: The most relevant files in May 2020 are likely to be part of a recent update to the dog genome, possibly the CanFam3.1 or a newer version if one was released by then. Given the timeline, CanFam3.1 (released in 2011) was a significant update, but there might have been more recent updates by May 2020.\n   - **Ensembl Database**: Ensembl is known for its comprehensive and up-to-date genomic data. It is a reliable source for the most recent and relevant genome assemblies. The most recent version as of May 2020 is likely to be available on Ensembl.\n   - **NCBI Database**: NCBI is another reliable source for genome assemblies. If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, NCBI should be checked for the most recent dog genome assembly as of May 2020.\n   - **Dog10K Project**: The Dog10K project, which aims to sequence 10,000 canid genomes, might have contributed to more recent and relevant genome assemblies. This project could have provided updates or improvements to the dog genome by May 2020.\n   - **Version Number**: Based on the timeline and the rapid advancements in genomics, it is reasonable to assume that a version more recent than CanFam3.1 was available by May 2020. The version number is likely to be CanFam3.1 or a subsequent version, such as CanFam3.1.2 or CanFam3.2.\n\n### Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Most Recent Version on Ensembl**: Given the current search results, it seems that the search term 'Canis lupus familiaris genome assembly' did not yield the expected results. However, the most recent version as of May 2020 is still likely to be available on Ensembl. We should refine our search to directly access the dog genome page.\n- **Specific Search Term**: Using a more specific search term like 'Canis lupus familiaris genome assembly' might help in finding the correct page. Alternatively, navigating through the species list or using the 'Genomes' tab on the Ensembl homepage might lead us to the correct page more efficiently.\n- **NCBI as a Backup**: If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, NCBI should be checked as a backup. The NCBI database is comprehensive and might have the specific version and download links we need.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Refined Search**: The initial search terms might have been too broad, leading to irrelevant results. A more specific search term should help in finding the correct page.\n- **Navigation Through Species List**: Navigating through the species list on Ensembl or using the 'Genomes' tab might be a more direct way to find the dog genome assembly page.\n- **NCBI Backup**: NCBI is a reliable alternative if Ensembl does not provide the necessary information. It is important to check both databases to ensure we find the most relevant files.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Refine Search on Ensembl**:\n   - Go to the Ensembl homepage (https://www.ensembl.org/).\n   - Use the search bar to search for 'Canis lupus familiaris genome assembly'.\n   - If the search does not yield the expected results, navigate through the species list or use the 'Genomes' tab to find the dog genome page.\n   - Identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n   - Navigate to the download page for that version and extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n\n2. **Check NCBI**:\n   - If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, go to the NCBI homepage (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).\n   - Use the search bar to search for 'Canis lupus familiaris genome assembly'.\n   - Identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n   - Navigate to the download page for that version and extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n\n3. **Extract Download Link**:\n   - Once the correct version is identified, navigate to the download page for that specific version.\n   - Extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n\n4. **Summarize and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - Summarize the version of the dog genome assembly and the direct download link.\n   - Compile and provide the final answer, including the version of the genome and the download link.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to https://www.ensembl.org/ and search for 'Canis lupus familiaris genome assembly'.\n- **WebSurfer**: If the search does not yield the expected results, navigate through the species list or use the 'Genomes' tab to find the dog genome page.\n- **WebSurfer**: Identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the download page for the identified version.\n- **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n- **WebSurfer**: If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, navigate to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and repeat the search process.\n- **WebSurfer**: Summarize the version and download link.\n- **Assistant**: Compile and provide the final answer.\n\nLet's proceed with the refined search on Ensembl.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n1. **Incorrect Search Terms**: The search terms used ('Canis lupus familiaris' and 'Canis lupus familiaris genome assembly') were too broad and did not lead directly to the dog genome assembly page.\n2. **Navigational Issues**: The search results included irrelevant entries, such as human phenotypes related to lupus, which did not help in finding the dog genome assembly.\n3. **Lack of Specific Navigation**: Direct navigation to the dog genome page via the species list or the 'Genomes' tab was not attempted, which could have been a more straightforward approach.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Navigate to Ensembl Homepage**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Ensembl homepage (https://www.ensembl.org/).\n\n2. **Use the Species List**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Species' tab or navigate to the species list.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Locate 'Canis lupus familiaris' in the list of species.\n\n3. **Identify Genome Assembly Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: On the dog genome page, identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for the release date and version number of the genome assembly.\n\n4. **Navigate to Download Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Download' or 'FTP' link to access the download page for the identified version.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n\n5. **Fallback to NCBI**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, navigate to the NCBI homepage (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search bar to search for 'Canis lupus familiaris genome assembly'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the download page for that version and extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n\n6. **Summarize and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the version of the dog genome assembly and the direct download link.\n   - **Assistant**: Compile and provide the final answer, including the version of the genome and the download link.\n\n### Steps to Follow:\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to https://www.ensembl.org/.\n- **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Species' tab or navigate to the species list.\n- **WebSurfer**: Locate 'Canis lupus familiaris' in the list of species.\n- **WebSurfer**: On the dog genome page, identify the most recent genome assembly version as of May 2020.\n- **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Download' or 'FTP' link to access the download page for the identified version.\n- **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download link for the relevant genome files.\n- **WebSurfer**: If Ensembl does not provide the necessary information, navigate to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and repeat the search process.\n- **WebSurfer**: Summarize the version and download link.\n- **Assistant**: Compile and provide the final answer."}
