Layer Cake (2004)\n2. Casino Royale (2006)\n3. Quantum of Solace (2008)\n4. Skyfall (2012)\n5. Spectre (2015)\n6. No Time to Die (2021)\n\n### Step 2: IMDB Ratings and Durations\nI will now gather the IMDB ratings and durations for these films. From my knowledge, here are the details I have:\n\n- **Layer Cake (2004)**: IMDB rating 7.3, Duration 105 minutes\n- **Casino Royale (2006)**: IMDB rating 8.0, Duration 144 minutes\n- **Quantum of Solace (2008)**: IMDB rating 6.6, Duration 106 minutes\n- **Skyfall (2012)**: IMDB rating 7.7, Duration 143 minutes\n- **Spectre (2015)**: IMDB rating 6.8, Duration 148 minutes\n- **No Time to Die (2021)**: IMDB rating 7.3, Duration 163 minutes\n\n### Step 3: Filter Movies Less Than 150 Minutes\nThe filtered list of Daniel Craig movies that are less than 150 minutes:\n1.

I'll begin by verifying \"Casino Royale (2006)\" availability first, as it has the highest IMDB rating of 8.0.\n\nHere's the script to check availability:\n\n```python\nfrom functions import perform_web_search\n\n# Check availability for Casino Royale (2006)\nresult_casino_royale = perform_web_search(\"Casino Royale 2006 Netflix US availability\")\n\nprint(result_casino_royale)\n```\n\nI will now execute this code with the Computer_terminal."}
