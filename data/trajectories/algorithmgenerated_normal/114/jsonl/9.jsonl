Review the sample dataset and ensure it is representative of the real data.\n2. Verify the function used to find the smallest house and ensure it correctly filters and identifies the smallest house based on the specified criteria.\n\n## Output format\n- Confirmation of the dataset's representativeness\n- Verification of the function's correctness\n- Any identified issues or errors\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure the sample dataset is representative of the real data.\n- Ensure the function correctly identifies the smallest house based on the specified criteria."}
{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "To proceed with the verification task based on the sample dataset and the function used for finding the smallest house in Prince Edward Island, I will need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Review the Sample Dataset:** I will need to examine the dataset's structure, including its columns for square footage, the number of beds and baths, the sale date, and the sale location. This will allow me to determine if it adequately represents houses sold in Prince Edward Island during the specified time frame.\n\n2. **Verify the Function's Correctness:** I will review the logic used in the function that identifies the smallest house with at least 2 beds and 2 baths. This includes checking whether it correctly filters based on the criteria (bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and date range) and whether it accurately calculates the smallest square footage.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- Please provide the sample dataset you are using for verification, as well as the function that is being implemented to find the smallest house based on the specified criteria. \n- Once I have this information, I can analyze and perform the necessary verifications."}
