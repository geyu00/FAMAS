Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The individual plans to visit California's Great America in San Jose once a month in June, July, August, and September 2024.\n   - The visits are planned for the summer of 2024.\n   - Single-day tickets are available for as low as $40 when purchased online, with potential savings of up to $40 off the front gate price on select days.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact cost of a single-day ticket for California's Great America in 2024 (we know it can be as low as $40 online, but need the standard price).\n   - The exact cost of a season pass for California's Great America in 2024.\n   - Specific details about any discounts or promotions that might affect the cost of tickets or passes in 2024.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n     - Official California's Great America website.\n     - Customer service or help desk of California's Great America.\n     - Recent news articles or press releases about ticket prices for the park.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Total cost of purchasing four single-day tickets (one for each month).\n   - Total savings by purchasing a season pass instead of four single-day tickets.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Season passes often offer significant savings compared to buying multiple single-day tickets.\n   - The cost of a single-day ticket might range from $40 to $80 based on the online discount and typical pricing for amusement parks.\n   - The cost of a season pass might range from $100 to $200, but this is a rough estimate and needs verification.\n   - Given the promotional text \"Unlimited Visits & Free Parking through Labor Day! Pays for itself in less than 2 visits,\" it is likely that the season pass is priced around $80 to $100, which would make it cost-effective for two visits.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The single-day ticket being as low as $40 online suggests that the standard price might be higher, but still within a reasonable range for amusement parks.\n- The promotional text indicating that the season pass pays for itself in less than 2 visits suggests that the season pass is priced to be cost-effective for frequent visitors, likely around $80 to $100.\n\nNext Steps:\n- **WebSurfer**: Continue searching the official California's Great America website for the exact cost of a season pass and any additional promotions or discounts.\n- **WebSurfer**: Verify the standard price of a single-day ticket, as the online price might be lower than the front gate price.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Lack of Specific Navigation**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were not specific enough to guide them directly to the sections containing the ticket prices.\n- **Inadequate Verification**: There was no explicit step to verify whether the WebSurfer had found the correct information or needed to scroll further.\n- **Repetition of Actions**: The WebSurfer was repeatedly asked to scroll down without a clear goal or endpoint, leading to inefficiency.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate Directly to Ticket Pages**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Go to the official California's Great America website.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the \"Daily Tickets\" page.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the \"Season Pass\" page.\n\n- **Step 2: Extract Specific Information**\n  - **WebSurfer**: On the \"Daily Tickets\" page, locate and provide the exact cost of a single-day ticket for 2024.\n  - **WebSurfer**: On the \"Season Pass\" page, locate and provide the exact cost of a season pass for 2024.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check for any special promotions or discounts that might affect the ticket prices.\n\n- **Step 3: Calculate Costs**\n  - **Assistant**: Once the prices are obtained, calculate the total cost of purchasing four single-day tickets (one for each month: June, July, August, and September).\n  - **Assistant**: Calculate the cost of a season pass.\n\n- **Step 4: Determine Savings**\n  - **Assistant**: Subtract the cost of the season pass from the total cost of four single-day tickets to determine the savings.\n\n- **Step 5: Present Results**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and present the amount saved by purchasing a season pass instead of four single-day tickets.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Specific Navigation**: Provide clear and specific instructions for navigating to the exact pages and sections containing the ticket prices.\n- **Verification**: After each navigation step, ask the WebSurfer to confirm that they have found the correct information before proceeding.\n- **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure that each step is distinct and leads to a clear outcome, avoiding repetitive actions.\n\n### Updated Instructions\n\n1. **Navigate to the Official Website**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the official California's Great America website: [California's Great America](https://www.cagreatamerica.com).\n\n2. **Navigate to Daily Tickets Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the \"Daily Tickets\" link in the navigation menu.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Locate and provide the exact cost of a single-day ticket for 2024. Confirm that you have found the correct information.\n\n3. **Navigate to Season Pass Page**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Return to the homepage if necessary.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the \"Season Pass\" link in the navigation menu.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Locate and provide the exact cost of a season pass for 2024. Confirm that you have found the correct information.\n\n4. **Check for Promotions**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for any special promotions or discounts that might affect the ticket prices on both the \"Daily Tickets\" and \"Season Pass\" pages. Provide any relevant information.\n\n5. **Calculate Costs**\n   - **Assistant**: Once the prices are obtained, calculate the total cost of purchasing four single-day tickets.\n   - **Assistant**: Calculate the cost of a season pass.\n\n6. **Determine Savings**\n   - **Assistant**: Subtract the cost of the season pass from the total cost of four single-day tickets to determine the savings.\n\n7. **Present Results**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and present the amount saved by purchasing a season pass instead of four single-day tickets."}
