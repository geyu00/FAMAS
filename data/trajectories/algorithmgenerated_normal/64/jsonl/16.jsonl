Which military unit did the author of this book join in 1813? Answer without using articles. Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify the military unit joined by the author of the book held by the person in the photograph with accession number 2022.128 in the Whitney Museum of American Art's collection in 1813.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The art historian will identify the book and its author from the photograph.\n2. The historian will provide information on the military unit the author joined in 1813.\n3. The fact-checker will verify the accuracy of the information provided.\n\n## Output format\n- Name of the military unit the author joined in 1813.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The information must be accurate and verifiable.\n- The response should not include articles.\n\n## Results from last response\nThe experts were unable to find direct information about the photograph with accession number 2022.128 in the Whitney Museum of American Art's collection. They attempted web searches but didn't retrieve the necessary details about the book and its author.\n\n## Errors or issues in the conversation\n1. The repeated incorrect implementation of the web search function:\n    - Initially, the function `perform_web_search` was called without importing it, leading to a `NameError`.\n    - The repeated attempts suggest a lack of validation to ensure the function was properly defined and imported.\n\n2. Failure to retrieve critical information:\n    - Despite multiple web searches, none returned the necessary details about the `2022.128` photograph, indicating possibly insufficient keywords or lack of detailed indexing in the search results.\n\n### Need to double-check?\nYes\n\n## Additional information (file path, code blocks, url, etc.)\n```python\nfrom functions import perform_web_search\n\nsearch_query = \"Whitney Museum of American Art accession number 2022.128 photograph person holding book\"\nresults = perform_web_search(search_query)\nprint(results)\n```\n\n```python\nsearch_query = \"Whitney Museum of American Art collection 2022.128\"\nresults = perform_web_search(search_query)\nprint(results)\n```"}
