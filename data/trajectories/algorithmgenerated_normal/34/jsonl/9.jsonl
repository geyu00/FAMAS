The relevant configurations for steam locomotives based on the Whyte notation are typically those that follow the format of the number of wheels (e.g., 0-4-0, 2-6-0, etc.). \n\nI'll calculate the total number of wheels for the identified steam locomotive configurations using the Whyte notation:\n\n- 0-4-0 = 4 wheels\n- 4-4-0 = 8 wheels\n- 2-6-0 = 8 wheels\n- 2-8-0 = 10 wheels\n- 2-6-4 = 12 wheels\n- 2-8-4 = 12 wheels\n\nNow, I will implement the calculation for the total number of wheels based on these configurations.
