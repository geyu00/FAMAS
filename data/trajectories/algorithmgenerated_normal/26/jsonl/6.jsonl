{"agent": "DataVerification_Expert", "content": "To solve the problem, let's follow the plan outlined by the manager step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the starting percentage and the final percentage:**\n   - Starting percentage = 37%\n   - Change in percentage = 13%\n   - Final percentage = Starting percentage - Change = 37% - 13% = 24%\n\n2. **Calculate the difference in percentage:**\n   - The change from 37% to 24% is a drop of 13%.\n\n3. **Determine the number of years it took for this change to occur based on the information provided by Girls Who Code.**  \n   Since I need to find out how many years it took for the percentage to change, I will need to gather data from Girls Who Code. \n\nI will now search for relevant information regarding the percentage of women computer scientists and the timeframe in which this change occurred. I will utilize the Bing Search API to gather this data. \n\nLet's proceed with the search. \n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Function to search for data regarding percentage change of women in computer science\ndef search_girls_who_code():\n    search_url = \"https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search\"\n    headers = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": \"YOUR_BING_SEARCH_API_KEY\"}\n    query = \"percentage of women computer scientists change over the years site:girlswhocode.com\"\n    \n    response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers, params={\"q\": query, \"textDecorations\": True, \"textFormat\": \"HTML\"})\n    return response.json()\n\n# Execute the function\nsearch_results = search_girls_who_code()\nsearch_results\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `\"YOUR_BING_SEARCH_API_KEY\"` with the actual API key. After running the above code, I'll analyze the search results for relevant information to determine how many years it took for the percentage to change from 37% to 24%. \n\nI'll wait for the execution result to process the output."}
{"agent": "Statistics_Expert", "content": "It seems there's a misunderstanding here. The task does not require searching for additional data from the Girls Who Code organization or any external source. Instead, it requires straightforward calculations based on the information provided.\n\nTo calculate the number of years it took for the percentage of women computer scientists to change from 37% to 24% with a decrease of 13%, we can draw on existing historical data that might indicate the rate of change. However, if we assume this information was previously provided by Girls Who Code, we can set up a hypothetical rate of change.\n\nSince we currently lack the specific rate at which this percentage changed, let me outline a method to hypothetically determine the number of years based on the assumption that we had data regarding the change rate.\n\nFor example, if we determine that the change occurred at a rate of 1% per year, we can calculate:\n\n```python\n# Hypothetical rate of change\nrate_of_change = 1  # This value would ideally be based on actual data\n\n# Current data\nstarting_percentage = 37\nfinal_percentage = 24\npercentage_change = starting_percentage - final_percentage  # This should be 13%\n\n# Calculate the years it took for this change\nnumber_of_years = percentage_change / rate_of_change\nprint(number_of_years)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will provide an estimation of the years taken for the percentage change based on our hypothetical rate. \n\nSince I cannot assume the exact rate without reliable data, I suggest running the above logic with actual data if available. For the sake of completing the task based on the information already stated, let's consider an average rate that could be proposed.\n\nIf the rate is 1% per year, we can compute it. I can prepare the execution code to estimate that.\n\nWould you like to proceed with this hypothetical approach, or is there a specific rate you would want to use for the calculation?"}
