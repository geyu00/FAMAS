Let's retrieve this information step by step.\n\n1. **Identify Featured Articles promoted in November 2016**:\n   I will look through the list of Featured Articles on Wikipedia to find the dinosaur article that fits this criterion.\n\n2. **Find the specific dinosaur article and its nomination page**:\n   Once I have identified the dinosaur article, I will proceed to find its nomination page to see who nominated it.\n\nLet's begin by searching for the Featured Articles promoted in November 2016. I'll perform a query to retrieve this information. \n\nI'll start looking at the relevant Wikipedia pages and document the findings. Please hold on for a moment. \n\nI'll also prepare a query to extract the relevant information. \n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Function to fetch featured articles promoted in a specific month and year\ndef fetch_featured_articles(year, month):\n    url = f\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/{year}_{month}\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n    # Find all the links to featured articles promoted\n    promoted_articles = soup.find_all('span', class_='mw-headline')\n    featured_dinosaurs = []\n\n    for article in promoted_articles:\n        if \"dinosaur\" in article.text.lower():\n            featured_dinosaurs.append(article.text)\n\n    return featured_dinosaurs\n\n# Fetch Featured Articles for November 2016\nfeatured_november_2016 = fetch_featured_articles(2016, 'November')\nprint(featured_november_2016)\n```\n\nI will check if the above code successfully identifies any dinosaur featured articles from November 2016.

Check the full list of dinosaur articles on Wikipedia.\n2. Narrow down the articles to those promoted or nominated in November 2016.\n3. Identify the nominator from the respective nomination discussions.\n\nLet me look at the general list of dinosaur articles first to cross-check their nomination history. \n\nI will refine the search criteria further to gather specifics about nominations for any dinosaur-related articles.
