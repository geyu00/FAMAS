{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a contributor to a version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question added support for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name, when transliterated to the Latin alphabet, matches the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The version of OpenCV that added support for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributors to that specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Specific details about the contribution of the person whose name matches a former Chinese head of government.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n   - The role or nature of the contribution made by this individual to the OpenCV project.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor could be someone like Li Peng or Zhu Rongji, as these are well-known figures in Chinese politics.\n   - The contributor's name might be a common Chinese name, which could increase the likelihood of a match.\n   - The version of OpenCV that added Mask-RCNN support is likely a recent one, possibly within the last few years.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Version of OpenCV with Mask-RCNN Support**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for the specific version of OpenCV that added support for the Mask-RCNN model.\n  \n- **List Contributors to That Version of OpenCV**\n  - Once the version is identified, use WebSurfer to find the release notes or changelog for that version to list the contributors.\n  \n- **Transliterate Names of Former Chinese Heads of Government**\n  - Use WebSurfer to find a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n  \n- **Match Contributor Names with Former Chinese Heads of Government**\n  - Compare the list of contributors to the list of former Chinese heads of government to find any matches.\n  \n- **Verify the Contribution**\n  - If a match is found, use WebSurfer to verify the nature and extent of the contribution made by the matched contributor to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Summarize and Report Findings**\n  - Compile the findings into a clear and concise report, including the version of OpenCV, the matched contributor, and the verified contribution details."}

However, you can use OpenCV in combination with external frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to implement Mask R-CNN. OpenCV's \ndnn module does support loading pre-trained Mask R-CNN models for inference, but it does not provide training capabilities.\nTo use Mask R-CNN with OpenCV, ensure you have the following:\nOpenCV Version: OpenCV 3.4 or later (preferably OpenCV 4.x) includes the \ndnn module, which supports loading and running pre-trained Mask R-CNN models.\nPre-trained Models: You can download pre-trained Mask R-CNN models, such as those trained on the COCO dataset. These typically include:\nmask_rcnn_inception_v2_coco.pb (TensorFlow model)\nmask_rcnn_frozen_inference_graph.pb (TensorFlow frozen graph)\nDependencies:\nInstall OpenCV with the \ndnn module: \npip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-pythonEnsure TensorFlow or PyTorch is installed if you need to train or fine-tune the model.\nExample Workflow\nHere’s a high-level workflow for using Mask R-CNN with OpenCV:\nLoad the pre-trained Mask R-CNN model using OpenCV's \ndnn module.\nPerform inference on images or videos to detect objects and segment masks.\nVisualize the results using OpenCV's drawing functions.\nEdit\nPerform Analysis\nTime complexity\nSpace complexity\nChange Language\nPython\nC++\nJava\nC#\nJavaScript\nTesting Tools\nGenerate test data\nIntegrate test cases\nMore Actions\nPerform code review\nExplain the code\nAdd error handling\nMake code compilable\nRecreate\nCopy\nBing Writer • Generated with AI\nGithub\nhttps://github.com › opencv › opencv › issues\nSupport Mask RCNN models · Issue #11412 · …\nApr 27, 2018 · \nA model created by Tensorflow/Keras/MS Coco/Mask RCNN drops an exception when I try to import it with OpenCV DNN: Exception: OpenCV (4.0.0-pre) opencv/modules/dnn/src/tensorflow/tf_importer.cpp:485: error: ( …LearnOpenCV\nOpenCVComputer vision libraryOpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a contributor to a version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question added support for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name, when transliterated to the Latin alphabet, matches the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of OpenCV that added support for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributors to that specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Specific details about the contribution of the person whose name matches a former Chinese head of government.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n   - The role or nature of the contribution made by this individual to the OpenCV project.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor could be someone like Li Peng or Zhu Rongji, as these are well-known figures in Chinese politics.\n   - The contributor's name might be a common Chinese name, which could increase the likelihood of a match.\n   - The version of OpenCV that added Mask-RCNN support is likely a recent one, possibly within the last few years. Based on the release notes we've seen, it appears that support for advanced models like Mask-RCNN was added in versions around 4.0 and later.\n   - The specific version of OpenCV that added Mask-RCNN support might be around 4.0 or 4.1, as these versions introduced significant improvements in deep learning and model support.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Version of OpenCV**: The release notes for versions 4.0 and later often mention improvements in deep learning capabilities, which aligns with the addition of Mask-RCNN support. Versions 4.0 and 4.1 are particularly notable for their enhancements in this area.\n- **Common Chinese Names**: Common names like \"Li\" and \"Zhu\" are frequently used in China, increasing the likelihood that a contributor with such a name might be involved in the OpenCV project.\n- **Former Chinese Heads of Government**: Li Peng and Zhu Rongji are well-known figures, and their names are commonly transliterated to the Latin alphabet as \"Li Peng\" and \"Zhu Rongji,\" respectively. These names are plausible matches for contributors due to their commonality.\n\nLet's proceed by focusing on the release notes for versions 4.0 and 4.1 to find the specific version that added Mask-RCNN support and the contributors to that version.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: We spent too much time scrolling through the releases without a clear strategy to identify the relevant version.\n- **Lack of Specific Search**: We did not use the search functionality within the GitHub repository to find specific keywords related to Mask-RCNN support.\n- **Overlooking Direct Links**: We missed the opportunity to directly access the changelog or release notes for specific versions, which could have provided the necessary information more efficiently.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use GitHub Search to Find Mask-RCNN Support**:\n   - Use the search bar within the OpenCV GitHub repository to search for keywords like \"Mask-RCNN\" or \"Mask R-CNN\" in the issues, pull requests, and commits.\n   - Example search query: `Mask-RCNN in:issues in:pulls in:commits`.\n\n2. **Directly Access Changelog for Specific Versions**:\n   - Once a relevant issue or commit is found, note the version number mentioned.\n   - Navigate directly to the release notes for that specific version using the URL structure: `https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/<version_number>`.\n\n3. **Identify Contributors**:\n   - From the release notes, identify the contributors listed for that version.\n   - If the release notes do not list contributors, check the pull requests and commits associated with the Mask-RCNN support for contributor names.\n\n4. **Transliterate Names of Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to find a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Example search query: `list of former Chinese heads of government Latin alphabet`.\n\n5. **Match Contributor Names**:\n   - Compare the list of contributors to the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n   - Identify any matches and verify the nature of their contribution.\n\n6. **Verify Contribution Details**:\n   - If a match is found, use WebSurfer to verify the specific contribution made by the matched contributor.\n   - Check the pull requests and commit messages for detailed information.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Search for Mask-RCNN Support**:\n   - Use the GitHub search bar within the OpenCV repository to search for \"Mask-RCNN\" in issues, pull requests, and commits.\n   - Example command: `WebSurfer.search(\"Mask-RCNN in:issues in:pulls in:commits\", \"https://github.com/opencv/opencv\")`.\n\n2. **Access Changelog for Specific Version**:\n   - Note the version number from the search results.\n   - Navigate to the release notes for that version using the direct URL.\n   - Example command: `WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/<version_number>\")`.\n\n3. **Identify Contributors**:\n   - Extract the list of contributors from the release notes.\n   - If not available, check the pull requests and commits related to Mask-RCNN support.\n   - Example command: `WebSurfer.extract_text(\"Contributors\")`.\n\n4. **Transliterate Names of Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - Perform a web search to find a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in the Latin alphabet.\n   - Example command: `WebSurfer.search(\"list of former Chinese heads of government Latin alphabet\")`.\n\n5. **Match Contributor Names**:\n   - Compare the list of contributors to the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n   - Identify any matches.\n   - Example command: `WebSurfer.compare_lists(contributors, former_heads_of_government)`.\n\n6. **Verify Contribution Details**:\n   - If a match is found, navigate to the specific pull requests and commit messages to verify the contribution.\n   - Example command: `WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/<pull_request_number>\")`.\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to efficiently find the version of OpenCV that added Mask-RCNN support, identify the relevant contributors, and match them with former Chinese heads of government."}

{"agent": "WebSurfer", "content": "The GitHub issue titled \"Support Mask RCNN models\" (#11412) discusses a problem where a Mask R-CNN model trained using TensorFlow/Keras/MSCOCO cannot be imported into OpenCV's DNN module. The user, @baranorbert, reports encountering an exception related to a missing constant kernel input when attempting to load the model. The issue includes details about the system configuration, the steps to reproduce the error, and attachments such as kernel names and a TensorBoard screenshot.\n\nThe OpenCV team, specifically @dkurt, engaged in the discussion, clarifying the origin of the Mask R-CNN model and the script used for conversion. After some back-and-forth, @dkurt informed @baranorbert that a pull request (#12243) had been merged to provide initial support for Mask R-CNN models from the TensorFlow Object Detection API. This update resolved the issue, and @baranorbert expressed gratitude for the support. The issue was subsequently closed."}
