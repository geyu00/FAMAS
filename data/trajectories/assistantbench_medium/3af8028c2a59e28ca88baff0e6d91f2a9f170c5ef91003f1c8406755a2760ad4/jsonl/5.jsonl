It is vitally important to ensure that there are multiple competitive decks for the tournament player to choose from. Why? If there were only a single viable deck to play, tournaments would quickly stagnate as players were forced to either play that deck or a deck built specifically to beat it. In addition, different players enjoy playing different types of decks. If there are plenty of viable options to play, there will be more players at more tournaments.\nTo help maintain the diversity and health of the \nMagic tournament environment, a system of banned and restricted lists has been developed. These lists are made up of cards that are either not allowed at all, or allowed only in a very limited manner.\nIt's important to note a couple of things: First, these lists apply only to Constructed formats and not Limited formats. Second, the banned and restricted lists are format-specific, so a card that is banned in Modern may still be legal to play in Standard.\nBanned Cards\nIf a card appears on the banned list for your chosen format, then you may not include that card in your deck or sideboard. Doing so makes your deck illegal to play in any sanctioned tournaments for that format.\nCards are usually banned from play if they enable a deck or play style that heavily skews the play environment. What does that mean? If the card were legal, a competitive player either \nmust be playing it, or must be specifically targeting it with his or her own strategies.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"url\": \"https://magic.wizards.com/en\",\n        \"logo\": \"https://images.ctfassets.net/s5n2t79q9icq/3dB5uyWzUH95O1ZPBNNUX5/6cff7c65a809285755ea24b164b6ac65/magic-logo.png?fm=webp\",\n        \"name\": \"Magic: The Gathering\",\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"sameAs\": [\n            \"https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering\",\n            \"https://twitter.com/wizards_magic\",\n            \"https://www.instagram.com/wizards_magic/\",\n            \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ZGymAvfP97qJabgqUkz4A\",\n            \"https://www.twitch.tv/magic\",\n            \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering\"\n        ],\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"google-site-verification\": \"IjersixWhzfN8VOx9F_Pqujt5-OxIFfqjjNAE3qnb_Q\",\n        \"og:locale\": \"en_US\",\n        \"og:locale:alternate\": \"es_ES\",\n        \"description\": \"To help maintain the diversity and health of the Magic tournament environment, a system of banned and restricted lists has been developed.\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Banned & Restricted | Magic: The Gathering\",\n        \"og:description\": \"To help maintain the diversity and health of the Magic tournament environment, a system of banned and restricted lists has been developed.\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://images.ctfassets.net/s5n2t79q9icq/5p96VsqUFOFydvLm9q0d9j/db8816b162d484efb1a2d476252658f6/MTG_Meta-ShareImage.jpg\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"Banned & Restricted | Magic: The Gathering\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"To help maintain the diversity and health of the Magic tournament environment, a system of banned and restricted lists has been developed.\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://images.ctfassets.net/s5n2t79q9icq/5p96VsqUFOFydvLm9q0d9j/db8816b162d484efb1a2d476252658f6/MTG_Meta-ShareImage.jpg\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"MAGIC: THE GATHERING\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Magic: The Gathering Standard card (non-foil paper version released in its original set) that was banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns (including Oko, Crown of Thorns) had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned at the same time.\n   - We are looking for a non-foil paper version of a card released in its original set.\n   - The card must have been banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns.\n   - We need to determine which card had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n   - The exact date when Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned is January 13, 2020.\n   - The following cards were banned on January 13, 2020:\n     - Oko, Thief of Crowns\n     - Mycosynth Lattice\n     - Once Upon a Time\n     - Veil of Summer\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical price data for each of these cards, including their all-time high and all-time low prices.\n   - Sources for historical price data, such as TCGplayer, MTG Goldfish, or Card Kingdom.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the price decrease for each card by subtracting the all-time low price from the all-time high price.\n   - Identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Cards that were popular or highly sought after before being banned are likely to have experienced significant price drops.\n   - Cards that were part of powerful combos or strategies involving Oko, Thief of Crowns might have seen large price fluctuations.\n   - Oko, Thief of Crowns itself is a strong candidate due to its significant impact on the metagame and popularity.\n   - Mycosynth Lattice, while less commonly played, might have seen a notable price drop due to its role in enabling powerful strategies.\n   - Once Upon a Time and Veil of Summer, being more widely used in various decks, might also have experienced significant price drops.\n   - Teferi, Time Raveler and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, although not banned on January 13, 2020, are mentioned as strong candidates due to their impact on the meta. However, they are not relevant to this specific query.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Oko, Thief of Crowns**: Given its central role in many decks and its dominance in the metagame, it is highly likely that its price saw a significant drop after the ban.\n- **Mycosynth Lattice**: While not as widely used as Oko, it enabled powerful strategies and could have seen a notable price drop.\n- **Once Upon a Time and Veil of Summer**: These cards were widely used in various decks and could have experienced significant price drops due to their versatility and popularity.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Gather historical price data for Oko, Thief of Crowns, Mycosynth Lattice, Once Upon a Time, and Veil of Summer from authoritative sources like TCGplayer, MTG Goldfish, or Card Kingdom.\n- Calculate the price decrease for each card.\n- Identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: Despite clicking on the \"Standard\" link multiple times, the web browser did not navigate to the correct page containing the historical price data for the banned cards.\n2. **Lack of Specificity**: The search terms and navigation steps were not specific enough to lead directly to the required data.\n3. **Redundant Actions**: Repeatedly clicking the same link without verifying the content of the page led to redundant actions and wasted time.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Verify the Correct Page**:\n   - Ensure that the web browser is navigated to the correct page on MTG Goldfish that contains historical price data for Standard cards.\n   - Specifically, navigate to the \"Standard\" price history page and verify that it displays the correct data.\n\n2. **Search for Banned Cards**:\n   - Use the search bar on the MTG Goldfish Standard price history page to search for each card banned on January 13, 2020: Oko, Thief of Crowns, Mycosynth Lattice, Once Upon a Time, and Veil of Summer.\n   - Verify that the search results display the historical price data for each card.\n\n3. **Extract Historical Price Data**:\n   - For each card, extract the all-time high and all-time low prices.\n   - Record this data in a structured format.\n\n4. **Calculate Price Decrease**:\n   - Write a Python script to calculate the price decrease for each card by subtracting the all-time low price from the all-time high price.\n   - Run the script using `ComputerTerminal` to get the results.\n\n5. **Identify the Card with the Highest Price Decrease**:\n   - Analyze the results to determine which card had the highest price decrease.\n   - Document the findings and provide the final answer.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - Open the MTG Goldfish website.\n   - Navigate to the \"Prices\" section.\n   - Select \"Price List\" and then \"Standard\".\n\n2. **Search for Banned Cards**:\n   - Use the search bar to search for each card:\n     - Oko, Thief of Crowns\n     - Mycosynth Lattice\n     - Once Upon a Time\n     - Veil of Summer\n   - Verify that the search results display the historical price data for each card.\n\n3. **Extract Historical Price Data**:\n   - For each card, extract the all-time high and all-time low prices.\n   - Record this data in a structured format (e.g., CSV file).\n\n4. **Write and Run Python Script**:\n   - Write a Python script to read the recorded data and calculate the price decrease for each card.\n   - Run the script using `ComputerTerminal`.\n\n5. **Analyze Results and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - Analyze the results to determine which card had the highest price decrease.\n   - Document the findings and provide the final answer.\n\n### Python Script Example\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Sample data structure\ndata = [\n    {\"card\": \"Oko, Thief of Crowns\", \"high\": 100.0, \"low\": 20.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Mycosynth Lattice\", \"high\": 50.0, \"low\": 10.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Once Upon a Time\", \"high\": 30.0, \"low\": 5.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Veil of Summer\", \"high\": 40.0, \"low\": 15.0}\n]\n\n# Calculate price decrease\nfor entry in data:\n    entry[\"decrease\"] = entry[\"high\"] - entry[\"low\"]\n\n# Find the card with the highest price decrease\nmax_decrease_card = max(data, key=lambda x: x[\"decrease\"])\n\nprint(f\"The card with the highest price decrease is {max_decrease_card['card']} with a decrease of ${max_decrease_card['decrease']:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **WebSurfer**:\n   - Navigate to the MTG Goldfish website.\n   - Go to the \"Prices\" section and select \"Price List\" and then \"Standard\".\n   - Search for each banned card and record the historical price data.\n\n2. **FileSurfer**:\n   - Save the recorded data to a CSV file.\n\n3. **ComputerTerminal**:\n   - Run the Python script to calculate the price decrease and identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **Assistant**:\n   - Analyze the results and provide the final answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Magic: The Gathering Standard card (non-foil paper version released in its original set) that was banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns (including Oko, Crown of Thorns) had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned at the same time.\n   - We are looking for a non-foil paper version of a card released in its original set.\n   - The card must have been banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns.\n   - We need to determine which card had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n   - The exact date when Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned is January 13, 2020.\n   - The following cards were banned on January 13, 2020:\n     - Oko, Thief of Crowns\n     - Mycosynth Lattice\n     - Once Upon a Time\n     - Veil of Summer\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical price data for each of these cards, including their all-time high and all-time low prices.\n   - Sources for historical price data, such as TCGplayer, MTG Goldfish, or Card Kingdom.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the price decrease for each card by subtracting the all-time low price from the all-time high price.\n   - Identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Oko, Thief of Crowns**: Given its central role in many decks and its dominance in the metagame, it is highly likely that its price saw a significant drop after the ban. Its popularity and impact make it a strong candidate for the highest price decrease.\n   - **Mycosynth Lattice**: While not as widely used as Oko, it enabled powerful strategies and could have seen a notable price drop. However, its niche use might limit the magnitude of the price drop.\n   - **Once Upon a Time**: This card was widely used in various decks and could have experienced significant price drops due to its versatility and popularity. Its frequent inclusion in different deck types suggests it might have a substantial price decrease.\n   - **Veil of Summer**: Another widely used card, Veil of Summer was a staple in many decks for its versatile utility. Its popularity and utility suggest it might have experienced a significant price drop.\n   - **Teferi, Time Raveler and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath**: Although not banned on January 13, 2020, they are mentioned as strong candidates due to their impact on the meta. However, they are not relevant to this specific query.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Oko, Thief of Crowns**: Its central role in many decks and its dominance in the metagame make it the most likely candidate for the highest price decrease. The ban significantly reduced its value and demand.\n- **Once Upon a Time**: Its widespread use across various decks and its role in enabling powerful openings make it a strong contender for a significant price drop.\n- **Veil of Summer**: Its utility in providing protection and countering spells makes it a valuable card, and its ban likely caused a notable price decrease.\n- **Mycosynth Lattice**: While less common, its ability to enable powerful strategies suggests it might have seen a price drop, but the magnitude might be lower compared to the more widely used cards.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Gather Historical Price Data**:\n   - Navigate to the MTG Goldfish website.\n   - Go to the 'Prices' section, then select 'Price List' and 'Standard'.\n   - Search for each card (Oko, Thief of Crowns, Mycosynth Lattice, Once Upon a Time, and Veil of Summer) and record their all-time high and all-time low prices for the non-foil paper versions released in their original sets.\n\n2. **Calculate Price Decrease**:\n   - Write a Python script to calculate the price decrease for each card by subtracting the all-time low price from the all-time high price.\n   - Run the script using `ComputerTerminal` to get the results.\n\n3. **Identify the Card with the Highest Price Decrease**:\n   - Analyze the results to determine which card had the highest price decrease.\n   - Document the findings and provide the final answer.\n\n### Python Script Example\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Sample data structure\ndata = [\n    {\"card\": \"Oko, Thief of Crowns\", \"high\": 100.0, \"low\": 20.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Mycosynth Lattice\", \"high\": 50.0, \"low\": 10.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Once Upon a Time\", \"high\": 30.0, \"low\": 5.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Veil of Summer\", \"high\": 40.0, \"low\": 15.0}\n]\n\n# Calculate price decrease\nfor entry in data:\n    entry[\"decrease\"] = entry[\"high\"] - entry[\"low\"]\n\n# Find the card with the highest price decrease\nmax_decrease_card = max(data, key=lambda x: x[\"decrease\"])\n\nprint(f\"The card with the highest price decrease is {max_decrease_card['card']} with a decrease of ${max_decrease_card['decrease']:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **WebSurfer**:\n   - Navigate to the MTG Goldfish website.\n   - Go to the 'Prices' section, then select 'Price List' and 'Standard'.\n   - Search for each banned card and record the historical price data.\n\n2. **FileSurfer**:\n   - Save the recorded data to a CSV file.\n\n3. **ComputerTerminal**:\n   - Run the Python script to calculate the price decrease and identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **Assistant**:\n   - Analyze the results and provide the final answer.\n\nPlease proceed to gather the historical price data for the specified cards.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**:\n   - Despite clicking on the \"Standard\" link multiple times, the web browser did not navigate to the correct page containing the historical price data for the banned cards.\n   - The search results page was repeatedly accessed instead of the price list page.\n\n2. **Lack of Specificity**:\n   - The search terms and navigation steps were not specific enough to lead directly to the required data.\n   - There was a lack of verification to ensure the correct page was being accessed.\n\n3. **Redundant Actions**:\n   - Repeatedly clicking the same link without verifying the content of the page led to redundant actions and wasted time.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - Open the MTG Goldfish website.\n   - Navigate to the 'Prices' section.\n   - Select 'Price List' and then 'Standard'.\n   - Verify that the page displays the correct data for Standard cards.\n\n2. **Search for Banned Cards**:\n   - Use the search bar on the MTG Goldfish Standard price list page to search for each card banned on January 13, 2020:\n     - Oko, Thief of Crowns\n     - Mycosynth Lattice\n     - Once Upon a Time\n     - Veil of Summer\n   - Ensure the search results display the historical price data for each card.\n\n3. **Extract Historical Price Data**:\n   - For each card, extract the all-time high and all-time low prices.\n   - Record this data in a structured format (e.g., CSV file).\n\n4. **Write and Run Python Script**:\n   - Write a Python script to read the recorded data and calculate the price decrease for each card.\n   - Run the script using `ComputerTerminal` to get the results.\n\n5. **Analyze Results and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - Analyze the results to determine which card had the highest price decrease.\n   - Document the findings and provide the final answer.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **WebSurfer**:\n   - Open the MTG Goldfish website.\n   - Navigate to the 'Prices' section.\n   - Select 'Price List' and then 'Standard'.\n   - Verify that the page displays the correct data for Standard cards.\n   - Search for each banned card and record the historical price data.\n\n2. **FileSurfer**:\n   - Save the recorded data to a CSV file.\n\n3. **ComputerTerminal**:\n   - Run the Python script to calculate the price decrease and identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **Assistant**:\n   - Analyze the results and provide the final answer.\n\n### Python Script Example\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Sample data structure\ndata = [\n    {\"card\": \"Oko, Thief of Crowns\", \"high\": 100.0, \"low\": 20.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Mycosynth Lattice\", \"high\": 50.0, \"low\": 10.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Once Upon a Time\", \"high\": 30.0, \"low\": 5.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Veil of Summer\", \"high\": 40.0, \"low\": 15.0}\n]\n\n# Calculate price decrease\nfor entry in data:\n    entry[\"decrease\"] = entry[\"high\"] -

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Magic: The Gathering Standard card (non-foil paper version released in its original set) that was banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns (including Oko, Crown of Thorns) had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned at the same time.\n   - We are looking for a non-foil paper version of a card released in its original set.\n   - The card must have been banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns.\n   - We need to determine which card had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n   - The exact date when Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned is January 13, 2020.\n   - The following cards were banned on January 13, 2020:\n     - Oko, Thief of Crowns\n     - Mycosynth Lattice\n     - Once Upon a Time\n     - Veil of Summer\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Historical price data for each of these cards, including their all-time high and all-time low prices.\n   - Sources for historical price data, such as TCGplayer, MTG Goldfish, or Card Kingdom.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the price decrease for each card by subtracting the all-time low price from the all-time high price.\n   - Identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Oko, Thief of Crowns**: Given its central role in many decks and its dominance in the metagame, it is highly likely that its price saw a significant drop after the ban. Its popularity and impact make it a strong candidate for the highest price decrease.\n   - **Mycosynth Lattice**: While not as widely used as Oko, it enabled powerful strategies and could have seen a notable price drop. However, its niche use might limit the magnitude of the price drop.\n   - **Once Upon a Time**: This card was widely used in various decks and could have experienced significant price drops due to its versatility and popularity. Its frequent inclusion in different deck types suggests it might have a substantial price decrease.\n   - **Veil of Summer**: Another widely used card, Veil of Summer was a staple in many decks for its versatile utility. Its popularity and utility suggest it might have experienced a significant price drop.\n   - **Teferi, Time Raveler and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath**: Although not banned on January 13, 2020, they are mentioned as strong candidates due to their impact on the meta. However, they are not relevant to this specific query.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Oko, Thief of Crowns**: Its central role in many decks and its dominance in the metagame make it the most likely candidate for the highest price decrease. The ban significantly reduced its value and demand.\n- **Once Upon a Time**: Its widespread use across various decks and its role in enabling powerful openings make it a strong contender for a significant price drop.\n- **Veil of Summer**: Its utility in providing protection and countering spells makes it a valuable card, and its ban likely caused a notable price decrease.\n- **Mycosynth Lattice**: While less common, its ability to enable powerful strategies suggests it might have seen a price drop, but the magnitude might be lower compared to the more widely used cards.\n\n### New Insights and Adjustments\n- **Navigation Issues**: The previous attempts to navigate to the specific price data for the banned cards on MTG Goldfish encountered issues. This suggests that the search functionality or the structure of the website might be different from what was expected.\n- **Alternative Sources**: If navigating to the specific price data on MTG Goldfish continues to be problematic, consider using alternative sources like TCGplayer or Card Kingdom to gather the necessary historical price data.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Gather Historical Price Data**:\n   - Navigate to the MTG Goldfish website.\n   - Go to the 'Prices' section, then select 'Price List' and 'Standard'.\n   - Search for each card (Oko, Thief of Crowns, Mycosynth Lattice, Once Upon a Time, and Veil of Summer) and record their all-time high and all-time low prices for the non-foil paper versions released in their original sets.\n   - If MTG Goldfish continues to be problematic, use TCGplayer or Card Kingdom as alternative sources.\n\n2. **Calculate Price Decrease**:\n   - Write a Python script to calculate the price decrease for each card by subtracting the all-time low price from the all-time high price.\n   - Run the script using `ComputerTerminal` to get the results.\n\n3. **Identify the Card with the Highest Price Decrease**:\n   - Analyze the results to determine which card had the highest price decrease.\n   - Document the findings and provide the final answer.\n\n### Python Script Example\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Sample data structure\ndata = [\n    {\"card\": \"Oko, Thief of Crowns\", \"high\": 100.0, \"low\": 20.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Mycosynth Lattice\", \"high\": 50.0, \"low\": 10.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Once Upon a Time\", \"high\": 30.0, \"low\": 5.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Veil of Summer\", \"high\": 40.0, \"low\": 15.0}\n]\n\n# Calculate price decrease\nfor entry in data:\n    entry[\"decrease\"] = entry[\"high\"] - entry[\"low\"]\n\n# Find the card with the highest price decrease\nmax_decrease_card = max(data, key=lambda x: x[\"decrease\"])\n\nprint(f\"The card with the highest price decrease is {max_decrease_card['card']} with a decrease of ${max_decrease_card['decrease']:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **WebSurfer**:\n   - Navigate to the MTG Goldfish website.\n   - Go to the 'Prices' section, then select 'Price List' and 'Standard'.\n   - Search for each banned card and record the historical price data.\n   - If MTG Goldfish is still problematic, use TCGplayer or Card Kingdom.\n\n2. **FileSurfer**:\n   - Save the recorded data to a CSV file.\n\n3. **ComputerTerminal**:\n   - Run the Python script to calculate the price decrease and identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **Assistant**:\n   - Analyze the results and provide the final answer.\n\nPlease proceed to gather the historical price data for the specified cards. If you encounter any issues with MTG Goldfish, switch to TCGplayer or Card Kingdom.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**:\n   - The web browser did not navigate to the correct page containing the historical price data for the banned cards. Instead, it repeatedly accessed the search results page.\n   - The search functionality on MTG Goldfish might have been misinterpreted, leading to incorrect clicks or selections.\n\n2. **Lack of Verification**:\n   - There was no verification step to ensure that the correct page was being accessed and that the data being recorded was accurate.\n\n3. **Redundant Actions**:\n   - Repeatedly clicking the same link without verifying the content of the page led to redundant actions and wasted time.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - Open the MTG Goldfish website.\n   - Navigate to the 'Prices' section.\n   - Select 'Price List' and then 'Standard'.\n   - Verify that the page displays the correct data for Standard cards.\n\n2. **Search for Banned Cards**:\n   - Use the search bar on the MTG Goldfish Standard price list page to search for each card banned on January 13, 2020:\n     - Oko, Thief of Crowns\n     - Mycosynth Lattice\n     - Once Upon a Time\n     - Veil of Summer\n   - Ensure the search results display the historical price data for each card.\n\n3. **Extract Historical Price Data**:\n   - For each card, extract the all-time high and all-time low prices.\n   - Record this data in a structured format (e.g., CSV file).\n\n4. **Write and Run Python Script**:\n   - Write a Python script to read the recorded data and calculate the price decrease for each card.\n   - Run the script using `ComputerTerminal` to get the results.\n\n5. **Analyze Results and Provide Final Answer**:\n   - Analyze the results to determine which card had the highest price decrease.\n   - Document the findings and provide the final answer.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **WebSurfer**:\n   - Open the MTG Goldfish website.\n   - Navigate to the 'Prices' section.\n   - Select 'Price List' and then 'Standard'.\n   - Verify that the page displays the correct data for Standard cards.\n   - Use the search bar to search for each banned card and record the historical price data.\n\n2. **FileSurfer**:\n   - Save the recorded data to a CSV file.\n\n3. **ComputerTerminal**:\n   - Run the Python script to calculate the price decrease and identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **Assistant**:\n   - Analyze the results and provide the final answer.\n\n### Python Script Example\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Sample data structure\ndata = [\n    {\"card\": \"Oko, Thief of Crowns\", \"high\": 100.0, \"low\": 20.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Mycosynth Lattice\", \"high\": 50.0, \"low\": 10.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Once Upon a Time\", \"high\": 30.0, \"low\": 5.0},\n    {\"card\": \"Veil of Summer\", \"high\": 40.0, \"low\": 15.0}\n]\n\n# Calculate price decrease\nfor entry in data:\n    entry[\"decrease\"] = entry[\"high\"] - entry[\"low\"]\n\n# Find the card with the highest price decrease\nmax_decrease_card = max(data, key=lambda x: x[\"decrease\"])\n\nprint(f\"The card with the highest price decrease is {max_decrease_card['card']} with a decrease of ${max_decrease_card['decrease']:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **WebSurfer**:\n   - Open the MTG Goldfish website.\n   - Navigate to the 'Prices' section, then select 'Price List' and 'Standard'.\n   - Verify that the page displays the correct data for Standard cards.\n   - Use the search bar to search for each banned card and record the historical price data.\n\n2. **FileSurfer**:\n   - Save the recorded data to a CSV file.\n\n3. **ComputerTerminal**:\n   - Run the Python script to calculate the price decrease and identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **Assistant**:\n   - Analyze the results and provide the final answer."}
