Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is the Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n   - The request is for a bar that is closest to the Mummers Museum.\n   - The bar must be wheelchair accessible.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact address of the Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n   - A list of bars near the Mummers Museum.\n   - Information on the wheelchair accessibility of these bars.\n   - Sources: Google Maps, Yelp, the Mummers Museum's official website, and local accessibility guides or resources.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The distance between the Mummers Museum and each nearby bar.\n   - Determining which of the nearby bars is the closest to the Mummers Museum based on the distances calculated.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Mummers Museum is likely located in a part of Philadelphia that has several bars nearby, given the cultural and historical significance of the Mummers in the city.\n   - Some bars in Philadelphia are more likely to be wheelchair accessible due to modern building codes and city regulations, but verification will be needed.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to find the exact address of the Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to search for a list of bars near the Mummers Museum.\n- **Step 3:** For each bar identified, use WebSurfer to check if the bar is wheelchair accessible.\n- **Step 4:** Use WebSurfer to determine the distance from the Mummers Museum to each accessible bar.\n- **Step 5:** Identify the closest wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum based on the distances obtained.\n- **Step 6:** Verify the final result and provide the name and address of the closest wheelchair-accessible bar."}

The beers are all under $8, the \nwings and \nroast porks pair perfectly with Jack Daniel’s, and inhibitions are low. \nIncluded In\nThe Dive Bars Where Everyone Knows Your Name & Only Sometimes Makes Fun Of It\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Review\",\n        \"author\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"image\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/the-infatuation/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/cms/media/author_avatars/059AA83B-4692-426D-8334-05F5D7D2E7AD\",\n                \"name\": \"Candis R.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich bar is closest to Mummers Museum in Philadelphia and is wheel chair accessible?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is the Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n   - The request is for a bar that is closest to the Mummers Museum.\n   - The bar must be wheelchair accessible.\n   - The exact address of the Mummers Museum is 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n   - 12 Steps Down at 831 Christian St, Philadelphia, PA 19147 is wheelchair accessible and is 0.9 miles away from the Mummers Museum.\n   - The Pub on Passyunk East at 1501 E Passyunk Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19147 is 1.1 miles away from the Mummers Museum.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Information on the wheelchair accessibility of The Pub on Passyunk East.\n   - Information on the wheelchair accessibility and exact distance from the Mummers Museum for the following bars: Dirty Franks, Milkboy Coffee, Varga Bar & Restaurant, and Alma de Cuba.\n   - Additional sources: Google Maps, Yelp, the Mummers Museum's official website, and local accessibility guides or resources.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The distance between the Mummers Museum and each nearby bar.\n   - Determining which of the nearby bars is the closest to the Mummers Museum based on the distances calculated.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Mummers Museum is located in a part of Philadelphia that has several bars nearby, given the cultural and historical significance of the Mummers in the city.\n   - Some bars in Philadelphia are more likely to be wheelchair accessible due to modern building codes and city regulations, but verification will be needed.\n   - Based on the distances already known, 12 Steps Down is currently the closest wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum, but further verification is needed for the other bars to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The verification of 12 Steps Down being wheelchair accessible and its distance from the Mummers Museum provides a strong baseline for comparison.\n- The known distance of The Pub on Passyunk East (1.1 miles) suggests that 12 Steps Down (0.9 miles) is currently the closest wheelchair-accessible bar, but further checks are necessary to confirm the accessibility and distances of the remaining bars.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetition of Searches**: We repeatedly searched for the same information without confirming the wheelchair accessibility and exact distances for all the bars in one go.\n- **Incomplete Verification**: We did not systematically verify the wheelchair accessibility and exact distances for all the bars, leading to incomplete information.\n- **Lack of Structured Approach**: The process lacked a structured approach to ensure all required information was gathered efficiently.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Confirm the wheelchair accessibility and exact distance from the Mummers Museum for the remaining bars: Dirty Franks, Milkboy Coffee, Varga Bar & Restaurant, and Alma de Cuba.\n  - **Action**: Use WebSurfer to search for each bar individually, check their wheelchair accessibility, and calculate the exact distance from the Mummers Museum.\n  \n- **Step 2**: Compile the results for all the bars.\n  - **Action**: Create a list of bars with their wheelchair accessibility status and exact distances from the Mummers Museum.\n\n- **Step 3**: Determine the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n  - **Action**: Compare the distances of all the wheelchair-accessible bars and identify the closest one.\n\n- **Step 4**: Provide the final answer.\n  - **Action**: State the name and address of the closest wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum.\n\n### Detailed Actions\n\n- **For Dirty Franks**:\n  - Search for \"Dirty Franks wheelchair accessible\" and \"Distance from Mummers Museum to Dirty Franks\".\n  - Note the wheelchair accessibility and exact distance.\n\n- **For Milkboy Coffee**:\n  - Search for \"Milkboy Coffee wheelchair accessible\" and \"Distance from Mummers Museum to Milkboy Coffee\".\n  - Note the wheelchair accessibility and exact distance.\n\n- **For Varga Bar & Restaurant**:\n  - Search for \"Varga Bar & Restaurant wheelchair accessible\" and \"Distance from Mummers Museum to Varga Bar & Restaurant\".\n  - Note the wheelchair accessibility and exact distance.\n\n- **For Alma de Cuba**:\n  - Search for \"Alma de Cuba wheelchair accessible\" and \"Distance from Mummers Museum to Alma de Cuba\".\n  - Note the wheelchair accessibility and exact distance.\n\n- **Compile and Compare**:\n  - Create a table or list of the bars with their wheelchair accessibility and exact distances.\n  - Identify the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n\n- **Final Answer**:\n  - Provide the name and address of the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**: Ensure each search is specific to the bar and includes both wheelchair accessibility and distance.\n- **Systematic Verification**: Verify each bar one by one to avoid missing any information.\n- **Note Taking**: Keep detailed notes of each bar's status to avoid redundant searches.\n- **Double-Check Results**: Before concluding, double-check the distances and accessibility to ensure accuracy."}
