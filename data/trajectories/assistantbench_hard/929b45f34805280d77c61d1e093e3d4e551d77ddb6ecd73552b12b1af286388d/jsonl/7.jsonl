What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The dog genome has been updated several times since.\n   - The request is for the most relevant files in May 2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The location or database where these files can be accessed.\n   - The exact release date or update of the dog genome closest to May 2020.\n   - Authoritative sources such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Ensembl, or the Broad Institute for genomic data.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020 based on the release dates and updates.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020 is likely one of the more recent updates, possibly CanFam3.1 or a subsequent version.\n   - The files are likely hosted on a major genomics database like NCBI or Ensembl.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search to find the most relevant version of the dog genome released around May 2020. Look for authoritative sources like NCBI, Ensembl, or the Broad Institute.\n  \n- **Locate the files for the identified version:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Once the specific version is identified, navigate to the relevant section of the database (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl) to locate the download links for the genome files.\n  \n- **Verify the download links:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Ensure that the links are active and point to the correct files. If necessary, click on the links to verify the file contents.\n  \n- **Provide the final link:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Summarize the findings and provide the direct link to the most relevant dog genome files for May 2020.\n\n- **Optional: Download and verify the files (if needed):**\n  - **FileSurfer:** If additional verification is required, download the files and check their integrity (e.g., file size, checksum).\n\n- **Document the process and findings:**\n  - **Assistant:** Compile the information gathered and provide a clear and concise answer to the original request, including the link to the relevant files."}

What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The dog genome has been updated several times since.\n   - The request is for the most relevant files in May 2020.\n   - The Broad Institute has been the steward of the high-quality dog genome reference assembly.\n   - The latest version of the dog genome as of May 2020 is CanFam3.1, which includes 85 MB of novel sequence and covers 99.8% of the euchromatic portion of the genome.\n   - The CanFam3.1 reference assembly is available via NCBI and can be accessed through the NCBI FTP server.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact release date or update of the CanFam3.1 genome closest to May 2020.\n   - The specific FTP directory or URL for downloading the CanFam3.1 reference assembly files from NCBI.\n   - Additional details about the improvements and features of the CanFam3.1 assembly.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Confirming that CanFam3.1 is indeed the most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020 based on its release date and updates.\n   - Verifying the completeness and reliability of the CanFam3.1 assembly for research purposes.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant version of the dog genome in May 2020 is CanFam3.1, given its improvements and the date of its release.\n   - The files for CanFam3.1 are likely hosted on the NCBI FTP server, specifically in the directory related to CanFam3.1.\n   - The NCBI FTP server is a reliable source for downloading genomic data, and the CanFam3.1 files should be available there.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **CanFam3.1 as the Most Relevant Version:** Based on the information from the Broad Institute and the improvements mentioned, CanFam3.1 is the most recent and comprehensive version of the dog genome as of May 2020.\n- **NCBI FTP Server for Downloads:** The Broad Institute and other sources indicate that NCBI is a primary repository for genomic data, including the CanFam3.1 reference assembly. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the FTP server is the most direct and reliable source for downloading these files.\n- **Reliability of NCBI FTP:** NCBI is a well-established and trusted resource for genomic data, and the FTP server is a standard method for distributing large datasets, making it a logical choice for accessing the CanFam3.1 files.\n\nNext steps:\n- Navigate to the NCBI FTP server and locate the specific directory for CanFam3.1 to provide the direct download link for the reference assembly files.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Access Blockage:** The attempt to access the NCBI website resulted in a temporary block due to a possible misuse/abuse situation. This is likely because of automated or rapid requests that triggered the NCBI's security measures.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Avoid Rapid Requests:** Use a more cautious approach to avoid triggering the NCBI's security measures.\n- **Use Alternative Sources:** If direct access to NCBI is blocked, use alternative sources like the UCSC Genome Browser or Ensembl to find the CanFam3.1 reference assembly files.\n- **Manual Verification:** Manually verify the download links to ensure they are active and correct.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n1. **Search for Alternative Sources:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search for \"CanFam3.1 FTP UCSC\" and \"CanFam3.1 FTP Ensembl\" to find alternative download links.\n\n2. **Navigate to UCSC Genome Browser:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser website and locate the CanFam3.1 reference assembly files.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Click on the relevant links to find the FTP directory or direct download links for the CanFam3.1 files.\n\n3. **Navigate to Ensembl:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the Ensembl website and search for the CanFam3.1 reference assembly.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Click on the relevant links to find the FTP directory or direct download links for the CanFam3.1 files.\n\n4. **Verify Download Links:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Ensure that the links are active and point to the correct files. If necessary, click on the links to verify the file contents.\n\n5. **Provide the Final Link:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Summarize the findings and provide the direct link to the most relevant dog genome files for May 2020.\n\n6. **Optional: Download and Verify the Files (if needed):**\n   - **FileSurfer:** If additional verification is required, download the files and check their integrity (e.g., file size, checksum).\n\n7. **Document the Process and Findings:**\n   - **Assistant:** Compile the information gathered and provide a clear and concise answer to the original request, including the link to the relevant files.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Slow Down Requests:** Space out web interactions to avoid triggering automated blocks.\n- **Use Multiple Sources:** Rely on multiple reputable sources to ensure access to the required files.\n- **Manual Verification:** Always manually verify links to ensure they are active and correct."}
