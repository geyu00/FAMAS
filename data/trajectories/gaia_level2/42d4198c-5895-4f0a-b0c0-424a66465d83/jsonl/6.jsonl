{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The task involves finding the number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for this game before the month listed as the game's release date.\n   - The release date and revision history should be taken from the Wikipedia page as of the most recent entry from 2022.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of the game that won the British Academy Games Award in 2019.\n   - The release date of the game as listed on its Wikipedia page.\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for the game before the month of its release date.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the specified month can be derived by checking the page's revision history up to the month before the game's release date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Award in 2019 is likely a well-known title, possibly one of the major releases of that year.\n   - The release date of the game is likely to be clearly stated on the Wikipedia page.\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the release date could be substantial, given the interest in major game releases.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Game:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for the name of the game that won the British Academy Games Award in 2019.\n  \n- **Find the Release Date:**\n  - Once the game is identified, use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page for the game and find the release date.\n\n- **Check Revision History:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the \"View history\" page of the Wikipedia article.\n  - Use WebSurfer to count the number of revisions before the month of the game's release date.\n\n- **Report the Results:**\n  - Summarize the findings, including the name of the game, its release date, and the number of revisions before the release month."}

The game was released worldwide for the \nPlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a \nWindows port released in January 2022. It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are basically 2 protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and \ngods of the Norse world.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"God of War (2018 video game)\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2016-06-14T19:06:41Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-16T13:09:35Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"headline\": \"2018 action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by Santa Monica Studio\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"853\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"God of War (2018 video game) - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Barlog released the overture as a thank you to fans for \nGod of War's E3 2016 trailer reaching fifteen million views on YouTube.\n[71]Release[edit]The game was released worldwide on April 20, 2018, for the PlayStation 4.\n[51] In addition to the standard base game, there were three special editions: the Stone Mason Edition, the Collector's Edition, and the Digital Deluxe Edition. The Stone Mason Edition was only available in the United States and Canada and came with several physical items, including: the base game in a SteelBook case, a 9-inch (230 mm) statue of Kratos and Atreus created by Gentle Giant, 2-inch (51 mm) carvings of the Huldra Brothers, a horse, and a troll, an exclusive \nlithograph, a cloth map, a \nstonemason's ring, and a keychain of Mímir's head that talks. There was a variety of \ndownloadable content (DLC), including an exclusive shield skin, as well as an armor set and another shield skin for Kratos, a PlayStation 4 dynamic theme, a digital artbook, and \nGod of War #0 by \nDark Horse Comics.\n[72] The Collector's Edition came with many of the same items, minus the ring, the keychain, the carvings of the horse and troll, and the exclusive shield skin. The Digital Deluxe Edition came with all the digital content, minus the exclusive shield skin. U.S. and Canadian customers also received a Kratos and Atreus \npin for pre-ordering the Digital Deluxe Edition. Pre-orders at select retailers received three skins for Kratos's shield. Pre-orders from \nGameStop or \nEB Games also received the \"Luck of Ages XP Talisman\", granting increased XP and Hacksilver gains and increased ability to trigger perks.\n[73]In addition to the special editions of the game, a Limited Edition PlayStation 4 Pro bundle was available the same day as the game's release. The bundle included the standard base game, a PlayStation 4 Pro console decorated with the runes on Kratos's axe, and a similarly themed \nDualShock 4 controller with the \nGod of War logo.\n[74] Additionally, an official \ntabletop \ncard game titled \nGod of War: The Card Game was released by \nCMON Limited on October 25, 2019. Created by Alexandru Olteanu and Fel Barros, players take on the role of the \nNorns, the \nFates of Norse mythology, as they try to prevent Ragnarök with different combinations of characters and events from the game, providing many variations to completing the card game.\n[75][76][77]Prior to launch, Barlog confirmed that \nGod of War would not have \nmicrotransactions, a feature that had become prominent with other games and criticized.\n[78] He also confirmed that the game would not have post-release DLC, like an \nexpansion pack. He said he had pitched an idea for DLC, \"but it was too ambitious\". His idea was similar in scope to that of \nThe Last of Us: Left Behind (2014) and \nUncharted: The Lost Legacy (2017), large standalone expansions for \nThe Last of Us (2013) and \nUncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016), respectively. He said it would have been too big to be DLC, warranting its own standalone release.\n[79]Post-launch, Santa Monica supported the game with \npatch updates to address \nsoftware bugs. As well, the developers added new features along with these free updates. A Photo Mode was released as part of update patch 1.20 on May 9, 2018. It allows players to take customized in-game screenshots. Players can adjust the field of view, depth of view, filters, borders, the visibility of characters, and the ability to change the facial expressions of Kratos and Atreus.\n[80] A \nNew Game Plus mode was released as part of update patch 1.30 on August 20, 2018. To access the mode, players must have completed the game at any difficulty level. The mode itself can be played at any difficulty, but enemies are at a higher level with new maneuvers. All obtained items carry over to New Game Plus, and there are new resources to further upgrade gear, which also have new rarity levels. The option to skip cutscenes was also added.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Award in 2019 is **God of War**.\n   - The task involves finding the number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for God of War before the month listed as the game's release date.\n   - The release date of God of War, as listed on its Wikipedia page, is **April 20, 2018**.\n   - The release date and revision history should be taken from the Wikipedia page as of the most recent entry from 2022.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for God of War before April 2018.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before April 2018 can be derived by checking the page's revision history up to the month before the game's release date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Award in 2019 is indeed a well-known title, and God of War is a major release of that year.\n   - The release date of God of War is clearly stated on the Wikipedia page.\n   - Given the significant interest in God of War, the number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the release date is likely to be substantial.\n   - The revision history of popular and highly anticipated games like God of War often includes frequent updates from the community, which could result in a high number of revisions.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The confirmation that God of War won the British Academy Games Award in 2019 provides a solid foundation for the rest of the task.\n- The release date of April 20, 2018, is clearly documented, which simplifies the process of counting revisions.\n- Major releases like God of War typically attract a lot of attention and contributions from the Wikipedia community, leading to numerous revisions before the release date.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Excessive Context Length**: The error indicates that the model's maximum context length is 32,768 tokens, but the request exceeded this limit. This suggests that the conversation history or the content being processed was too long.\n- **Repetitive Requests**: The repeated attempts to count the revisions without addressing the context length issue led to the same error repeatedly.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Reduce Context Length**: Ensure that the conversation history and content being processed are kept within the token limit.\n- **Directly Navigate to the 'View history' Page**: Instead of navigating through multiple sections, directly go to the 'View history' page to count the revisions.\n- **Count Revisions Efficiently**: Use a script or manual counting to efficiently count the revisions before April 2018.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n- **Navigate to the 'View history' Page**:\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page for God of War.\n  - Click on the 'View history' tab to access the revision history.\n- **Count Revisions Before April 2018**:\n  - Scroll through the revision history and count the number of revisions before April 2018.\n  - Use a script or manual counting to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Detailed Plan\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the God of War Wikipedia Page**\n  - Use WebSurfer to open the Wikipedia page for God of War.\n  - ```python\n    web_surfer.navigate_to(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\")\n    ```\n\n- **Step 2: Navigate to the 'View history' Page**\n  - Click on the 'View history' tab.\n  - ```python\n    web_surfer.click_element(\"a[title='View history of God of War (2018 video game)']\")\n    ```\n\n- **Step 3: Count Revisions Before April 2018**\n  - Scroll through the revision history and count the number of revisions before April 2018.\n  - Use a script to automate the counting process if possible.\n  - ```python\n    revisions_before_april_2018 = 0\n    while True:\n        revisions = web_surfer.find_elements(\"li.mw-changeslist-line\")\n        for revision in revisions:\n            date_str = revision.text.split(\" \")[0]\n            if date_str < \"2018-04\":\n                revisions_before_april_2018 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        if date_str >= \"2018-04\":\n            break\n        web_surfer.scroll_down()\n    print(f\"Number of revisions before April 2018: {revisions_before_april_2018}\")\n    ```\n\n- **Step 4: Report the Results**\n  - Summarize the findings, including the name of the game, its release date, and the number of revisions before the release month.\n  - ```python\n    print(\"The game that won the British Academy Games Award in 2019 is God of War.\")\n    print(\"The release date of God of War is April 20, 2018.\")\n    print(f\"The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before April 2018 is {revisions_before_april_2018}.\")\n    ```\n\nBy following this plan, we can avoid the context length issue and efficiently count the revisions before April 2018."}

The game was released worldwide for the \nPlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a \nWindows port released in January 2022. It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are basically 2 protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and \ngods of the Norse world.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"God of War (2018 video game)\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18345138\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2016-06-14T19:06:41Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-16T13:09:35Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"headline\": \"2018 action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by Santa Monica Studio\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/God_of_War_4_cover.jpg\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"853\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"God of War (2018 video game) - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The game in question won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019.\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Award in 2019 is **God of War**.\n   - The task involves finding the number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for God of War before the month listed as the game's release date.\n   - The release date of God of War, as listed on its Wikipedia page, is **April 20, 2018**.\n   - The release date and revision history should be taken from the Wikipedia page as of the most recent entry from 2022.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page for God of War before April 2018.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before April 2018 can be derived by checking the page's revision history up to the month before the game's release date.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The game that won the British Academy Games Award in 2019 is indeed a well-known title, and God of War is a major release of that year.\n   - The release date of God of War is clearly stated on the Wikipedia page.\n   - Given the significant interest in God of War, the number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the release date is likely to be substantial.\n   - The revision history of popular and highly anticipated games like God of War often includes frequent updates from the community, which could result in a high number of revisions.\n   - **New Guess**: The number of revisions before the release date might be in the hundreds, considering the high level of community engagement and the game's significance.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- The confirmation that God of War won the British Academy Games Award in 2019 provides a solid foundation for the rest of the task.\n- The release date of April 20, 2018, is clearly documented, which simplifies the process of counting revisions.\n- Major releases like God of War typically attract a lot of attention and contributions from the Wikipedia community, leading to numerous revisions before the release date.\n- **New Insight**: Popular and highly anticipated games often have a large number of edits leading up to their release, as the community actively updates and improves the page with new information, speculation, and media coverage. This suggests that the number of revisions could be quite high, potentially in the hundreds.\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the 'View history' Page**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Wikipedia page for God of War.\n   - Click on the 'View history' tab to access the revision history.\n   - ```python\n     web_surfer.navigate_to(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\")\n     web_surfer.click_element(\"a[title='View history of God of War (2018 video game)']\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Count Revisions Before April 2018**\n   - Scroll through the revision history and count the number of revisions before April 2018.\n   - Use a script to automate the counting process if possible.\n   - ```python\n     revisions_before_april_2018 = 0\n     while True:\n         revisions = web_surfer.find_elements(\"li.mw-changeslist-line\")\n         for revision in revisions:\n             date_str = revision.text.split(\" \")[0]\n             if date_str < \"2018-04\":\n                 revisions_before_april_2018 += 1\n             else:\n                 break\n         if date_str >= \"2018-04\":\n             break\n         web_surfer.scroll_down()\n     print(f\"Number of revisions before April 2018: {revisions_before_april_2018}\")\n     ```\n\n3. **Report the Results**\n   - Summarize the findings, including the name of the game, its release date, and the number of revisions before the release month.\n   - ```python\n     print(\"The game that won the British Academy Games Award in 2019 is God of War.\")\n     print(\"The release date of God of War is April 20, 2018.\")\n     print(f\"The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before April 2018 is {revisions_before_april_2018}.\")\n     ```\n\nBy following this updated plan, we can efficiently count the revisions before April 2018 and provide the required information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Inefficient Scrolling and Counting**: The previous attempts involved manually scrolling through the revision history and counting revisions, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.\n- **Lack of Automation**: The process of counting revisions was not automated, leading to repetitive and inefficient actions.\n- **Context Management**: The conversation history and context management were not optimized, leading to potential issues with token limits and redundant instructions.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the God of War Wikipedia Page**\n   - Use WebSurfer to open the Wikipedia page for God of War.\n   - ```python\n     web_surfer.navigate_to(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Navigate to the 'View history' Page**\n   - Click on the 'View history' tab to access the revision history.\n   - ```python\n     web_surfer.click_element(\"a[title='View history of God of War (2018 video game)']\")\n     ```\n\n3. **Automate the Counting Process**\n   - Use a Python script to automatically scroll through the revision history and count the number of revisions before April 2018.\n   - ```python\n     revisions_before_april_2018 = 0\n     while True:\n         revisions = web_surfer.find_elements(\"li.mw-changeslist-line\")\n         for revision in revisions:\n             date_str = revision.text.split(\" \")[0]\n             if date_str < \"2018-04\":\n                 revisions_before_april_2018 += 1\n             else:\n                 break\n         if date_str >= \"2018-04\":\n             break\n         web_surfer.scroll_down()\n     print(f\"Number of revisions before April 2018: {revisions_before_april_2018}\")\n     ```\n\n4. **Report the Results**\n   - Summarize the findings, including the name of the game, its release date, and the number of revisions before the release month.\n   - ```python\n     print(\"The game that won the British Academy Games Award in 2019 is God of War.\")\n     print(\"The release date of God of War is April 20, 2018.\")\n     print(f\"The number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before April 2018 is {revisions_before_april_2018}.\")\n     ```\n\n### Key Improvements\n\n- **Automation**: The counting process is now automated using a Python script, which will efficiently scroll through the revision history and count the revisions.\n- **Efficiency**: The script will stop counting once it reaches the first revision on or after April 2018, reducing unnecessary scrolling and processing.\n- **Context Management**: The plan is concise and focuses on the essential steps, minimizing the risk of exceeding token limits and ensuring clarity in instructions.\n\nBy following this new plan, we can avoid the previous issues and efficiently complete the task."}

The game was released worldwide for the \nPlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a \nWindows port released in January 2022. It is the eighth installment in the \nGod of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's \nGod of War III. \nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on \nGreek mythology, this installment transitioned the series to \nNorse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient \nScandinavia in the realm of \nMidgard. For the first time in the series, there are basically 2 protagonists: \nKratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only \nplayable character, and his young son, \nAtreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, Faye, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the \nnine realms. Kratos keeps his \ntroubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his \ndivine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and \ngods of the Norse world. \nDescribed by creative director \nCory Barlog as a reimagining of the franchise, a major \ngameplay change is that Kratos makes prominent use of a magical \nbattle axe known as the Leviathan Axe instead of his signature \ndouble-chained blades called the Blades of Chaos. The game also uses an \nover-the-shoulder free camera, with the game in \none shot, as opposed to the \nfixed cinematic camera of the previous entries. It also includes \nrole-playing game elements, and Kratos's son Atreus provides assistance in combat. The majority of the original game's development team worked on \nGod of War and designed it to be accessible and grounded. A separate short \ntext-based game, \nA Call from the Wilds, was released in February 2018 through \nFacebook Messenger and follows Atreus on his first adventure.
