{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking about the date when Regression was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The source for this information is GitHub.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific date when Regression was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - This information can be found by searching the numpy repository on GitHub for issues labeled \"Regression\" within the numpy.polynomial module, and then identifying the oldest closed issue with this label.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact date when the Regression label was added to the identified issue, which may require examining the issue's history or timeline on GitHub.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The numpy project is well-maintained and has a structured issue tracking system, so the information is likely to be accurately recorded.\n   - The oldest closed issue with the Regression label might be several years old, given the age of the numpy project.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the numpy repository on GitHub.**\n- **Use WebSurfer to navigate to the numpy repository and search for issues labeled \"Regression\" within the numpy.polynomial module.**\n- **Filter the search results to show only closed issues.**\n- **Sort the filtered issues by the oldest creation date.**\n- **Identify the oldest closed issue with the Regression label.**\n- **Examine the issue's timeline to find the exact date when the Regression label was added.**\n- **Format the date in MM/DD/YY format.**\n- **Report the date back to the user.**"}

The NumPy leadership has made a strong commitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. Please read the NumPy Code of Conduct for guidance on how to interact with others in a way that makes our community thrive. Call for Contributions The NumPy project welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm! Small improvements or fixes are always appreciated. If you are considering larger contributions to the source code, please contact us through the mailing list first. Writing code isn\\u2019t the only way to contribute to NumPy. You can also:  review pull requests help us stay on top of new and old issues develop tutorials, presentations, and other educational materials maintain and improve our website develop graphic design for our brand assets and promotional materials translate website content help with outreach and onboard new contributors write grant proposals and help with other fundraising efforts  For more information about the ways you can contribute to NumPy, visit our website. If you\\u2019re unsure where to start or how your skills fit in, reach out! You can ask on the mailing list or here, on GitHub, by opening a new issue or leaving a comment on a relevant issue that is already open. Our preferred channels of communication are all public, but if you\\u2019d like to speak to us in private first, contact our community coordinators at numpy-team@googlegroups.com or on Slack (write numpy-team@googlegroups.com for an invitation). We also have a biweekly community call, details of which are announced on the mailing list. You are very welcome to join. If you are new to contributing to open source, this guide helps explain why, what, and how to successfully get involved.\",\n            \"keywords\": \"\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"itemType\": \"https://schema.org/abstract\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"route-pattern\": \"/:user_id/:repository/issues/:number(.:format)\",\n        \"route-controller\": \"issues\",\n        \"route-action\": \"show\",\n        \"fetch-nonce\": \"v2:e69560a5-f08d-8ffb-1f21-66b9e3f59200\",\n        \"current-catalog-service-hash\": \"f3abb0cc802f3d7b95fc8762b94bdcb13bf39634c40c357301c4aa1d67a256fb\",\n        \"request-id\": \"7391:3A9182:4A9711:4D68B7:686FDAF4\",\n        \"html-safe-nonce\": \"046236b008447b509206bdcfdfe7c21b2ca0138bcf16aace3e08ba0e80fecdf5\",\n        \"visitor-payload\": \"eyJyZWZlcnJlciI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9udW1weS9udW1weS9pc3N1ZXMvMTEzOTIiLCJyZXF1ZXN0X2lkIjoiNzM5MTozQTkxODI6NEE5NzExOjRENjhCNzo2ODZGREFGNCIsInZpc2l0b3JfaWQiOiI2MjU2Njc0Mjc0MjU3Mzk0NDIwIiwicmVnaW9uX2VkZ2UiOiJzZWEiLCJyZWdpb25fcmVuZGVyIjoic2VhIn0=\",\n        \"visitor-hmac\": \"fcab8a5e6278afeb9c94e4ad1b0c48a0a7cdc70ad712ae2a4d923eddeb8542fd\",\n        \"hovercard-subject-tag\": \"issue:11392\",\n        \"github-keyboard-shortcuts\": \"repository,issues,copilot\",\n        \"google-site-verification\": \"Apib7-x98H0j5cPqHWwSMm6dNU4GmODRoqxLiDzdx9I\",\n        \"octolytics-url\": \"https://collector.github.com/github/collect\",\n        \"user-login\": \"\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width\",\n        \"description\": \"BUG: polyvalfromroots fails for multidimensional inputs · Issue #11392 · numpy/numpy · GitHub\",\n        \"fb:app_id\": \"1401488693436528\",\n        \"apple-itunes-app\": \"app-id=1477376905, app-argument=https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11392\",\n        \"twitter:image\": \"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/448f0502b50f63c82a1c62fa2a4951159aedc496f946f25067833428f3b99475/numpy/numpy/issues/11392\",\n        \"twitter:site\": \"@github\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"BUG: polyvalfromroots fails for multidimensional inputs · Issue #11392 · numpy/numpy · GitHub\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"BUG: polyvalfromroots fails for multidimensional inputs.
