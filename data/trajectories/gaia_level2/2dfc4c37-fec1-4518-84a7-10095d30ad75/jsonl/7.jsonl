Your answer should be a numerical integer value.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request asks about the overlap between the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies and the top 10 highest-grossing domestic movies for the year 2020.\n   - Box Office Mojo's 2020 Worldwide Box Office list is the source for the data.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies of 2020 from Box Office Mojo.\n   - The top 10 highest-grossing domestic (U.S.) movies of 2020 from Box Office Mojo.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The number of movies that appear in both the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide list and the top 10 highest-grossing domestic list for 2020.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on typical trends, it is likely that several of the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies will also be in the top 10 domestic list, but the exact number is unknown without checking the specific lists.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** WebSurfer to navigate to Box Office Mojo's 2020 Worldwide Box Office list and extract the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies.\n- **Step 2:** WebSurfer to navigate to Box Office Mojo's 2020 Domestic Box Office list and extract the top 10 highest-grossing domestic movies.\n- **Step 3:** Assistant to compare the two lists and count the number of overlapping movies.\n- **Step 4:** Assistant to provide the final numerical integer value as the answer."}
