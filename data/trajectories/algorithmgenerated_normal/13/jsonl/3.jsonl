The exhibition featured art and artifacts related to the twelve zodiac animals, exploring their significance in Chinese culture and art.\n\n2. **Identify the Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac**:\n   - Rat\n   - Ox\n   - Tiger\n   - Rabbit\n   - Dragon\n   - Snake\n   - Horse\n   - Goat (or Ram)\n   - Monkey\n   - Rooster\n   - Dog\n   - Pig\n\n3. **Analyze the Exhibits**: To determine which animals have a hand visible, I would typically look at the artworks and artifacts displayed in the exhibition. This includes sculptures, paintings, and other forms of art that portray these animals. The visibility of hands may vary based on artistic style and representation.\n\n4. **Verify the Accuracy of the Findings**: Once I gather the information on which animals have hands depicted, I'll ensure the findings are consistent across multiple reputable sources regarding the exhibition.\n\nNow, I will conduct research to find specific details about the artworks included in this exhibition and their representations of the zodiac animals, focusing on whether their hands are visible. I will gather data from reliable sources like exhibition catalogs, museum archives, and scholarly articles. \n\nLet me proceed with this research. Please hold on a moment while I gather the necessary information."}
