{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nOn Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The source for the information is the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n   - The focus is on the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n   - The task involves identifying the word deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article with the most titles containing \"witnesses\" as of 2021.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact title of the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically on the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n   - The articles within this section that contain \"witnesses\" in their titles.\n   - The specific article with the most titles containing \"witnesses.\"\n   - The text of the first rule in this article.\n   - The history of amendments to this rule, specifically the last amendment as of 2021.\n   - The word that was deleted in the last amendment to this rule.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which article has the most titles containing \"witnesses\" based on the list of articles found in the fifth section.\n   - Identifying the specific changes made in the last amendment to the first rule in the identified article.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically might be related to \"Rules of Evidence\" or a similar category, given the context of \"witnesses.\"\n   - The word deleted in the last amendment could be a common legal term or a procedural term often used in witness-related rules.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Fifth Section of Federal Rules Alphabetically**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Locate and identify the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n\n- **Find Articles Containing \"Witnesses\" in Titles**\n  - **WebSurfer**: List all articles within the identified section.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify which articles contain \"witnesses\" in their titles.\n\n- **Determine the Article with the Most Titles Containing \"Witnesses\"**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Count the number of titles containing \"witnesses\" for each relevant article.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the article with the most such titles.\n\n- **Locate the First Rule in the Identified Article**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the identified article and locate the first rule.\n\n- **Find the Last Amendment to the First Rule as of 2021**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check the history of amendments to the first rule.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last amendment made as of 2021.\n\n- **Identify the Word Deleted in the Last Amendment**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Compare the text before and after the last amendment to identify the word that was deleted."}

Competency to Testify in General \n Rule 601. Competency to Testify in General \n Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise. But in a civil case, state law governs the witness’s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision. \n Notes \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds of incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are religious belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the litigation as a party or interested person or spouse of a party or interested person. With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's Acts, American jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize these grounds. \n The Dead Man's Acts are surviving traces of the common law disqualification of parties and interested persons. They exist in variety too great to convey conviction of their wisdom and effectiveness. These rules contain no provision of this kind. For the reasoning underlying the decision not to give effect to state statutes in diversity cases, see the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 501. \n No mental or moral qualifications for testifying as a witness are specified. Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore §§501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty. This result may, however, be accomplished more directly, and without haggling in terms of legal standards, by the manner of administering the oath or affirmation under Rule 603. \n Admissibility of religious belief as a ground of impeachment is treated in Rule 610. Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Federal Rules of Evidence Toolbox \nWex: \nEvidence: Overview\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@graph\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"BreadcrumbList\",\n                \"itemListElement\": [\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 1,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu\",\n                            \"name\": \"LII\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 2,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre\",\n                            \"name\": \"Federal Rules of Evidence\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 5,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_601\",\n                            \"name\": \"\\nRule 601.

Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93–650 \n Rule 601 as submitted to the Congress provided that “Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules.” One effect of the Rule as proposed would have been to abolish age, mental capacity, and other grounds recognized in some State jurisdictions as making a person incompetent as a witness. The greatest controversy centered around the Rule's rendering inapplicable in the federal courts the so-called Dead Man's Statutes which exist in some States. Acknowledging that there is substantial disagreement as to the merit of Dead Man's Statutes, the Committee nevertheless believed that where such statutes have been enacted they represent State policy which should not be overturned in the absence of a compelling federal interest. The Committee therefore amended the Rule to make competency in civil actions determinable in accordance with State law with respect to elements of claims or defenses as to which State law supplies the rule of decision. Cf. \n Courtland v. Walston & Co., Inc  ., 340 F.Supp. 1076, 1087–1092 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93–1277 \n The amendment to rule 601 parallels the treatment accorded rule 501 discussed immediately above. \n Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No. 93–1597 \n Rule 601 deals with competency of witnesses. Both the House and Senate bills provide that federal competency law applies in criminal cases. In civil actions and proceedings, the House bill provides that state competency law applies “to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision.” The Senate bill provides that “in civil actions and proceedings arising under \n 28 U.S.C. §1332  or \n 28 U.S.C. §1335  , or between citizens of different States and removed under \n 28 U.S.C. §1441(b)  the competency of a witness, person, government, State or political subdivision thereof is determined in accordance with State law, unless with respect to the particular claim or defense, Federal law supplies the rule of decision.” \n The wording of the House and Senate bills differs in the treatment of civil actions and proceedings. The rule in the House bill applies to evidence that relates to “an element of a claim or defense.” If an item of proof tends to support or defeat a claim or defense, or an element of a claim or defense, and if state law supplies the rule of decision for that claim or defense, then state competency law applies to that item of proof. \n For reasons similar to those underlying its action on Rule 501, the Conference adopts the House provision. \n Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment \n The language of Rule 601 has been amended as part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only.

But in a civil case, state law governs the witness’s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision. \n Notes \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds of incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are religious belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the litigation as a party or interested person or spouse of a party or interested person. With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's Acts, American jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize these grounds. \n The Dead Man's Acts are surviving traces of the common law disqualification of parties and interested persons. They exist in variety too great to convey conviction of their wisdom and effectiveness. These rules contain no provision of this kind. For the reasoning underlying the decision not to give effect to state statutes in diversity cases, see the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 501. \n No mental or moral qualifications for testifying as a witness are specified. Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore §§501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty. This result may, however, be accomplished more directly, and without haggling in terms of legal standards, by the manner of administering the oath or affirmation under Rule 603. \n Admissibility of religious belief as a ground of impeachment is treated in Rule 610. Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93–650 \n Rule 601 as submitted to the Congress provided that “Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules.” One effect of the Rule as proposed would have been to abolish age, mental capacity, and other grounds recognized in some State jurisdictions as making a person incompetent as a witness. The greatest controversy centered around the Rule's rendering inapplicable in the federal courts the so-called Dead Man's Statutes which exist in some States. Acknowledging that there is substantial disagreement as to the merit of Dead Man's Statutes, the Committee nevertheless believed that where such statutes have been enacted they represent State policy which should not be overturned in the absence of a compelling federal interest. The Committee therefore amended the Rule to make competency in civil actions determinable in accordance with State law with respect to elements of claims or defenses as to which State law supplies the rule of decision.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nOn Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The source for the information is the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n   - The focus is on the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically is the \"Federal Rules of Evidence.\"\n   - The task involves identifying the word deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article with the most titles containing \"witnesses\" as of 2021.\n   - Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence is titled \"Witnesses\" and contains multiple rules related to witnesses.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact titles of the rules within Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n   - The specific article within the Federal Rules of Evidence that has the most titles containing \"witnesses.\"\n   - The text of the first rule in this article.\n   - The history of amendments to this rule, specifically the last amendment as of 2021.\n   - The word that was deleted in the last amendment to this rule.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which article within the Federal Rules of Evidence has the most titles containing \"witnesses\" based on the list of articles found in the fifth section.\n   - Identifying the specific changes made in the last amendment to the first rule in the identified article.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Article VI, \"Witnesses,\" is likely the article with the most titles containing \"witnesses\" within the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n   - The first rule in Article VI is Rule 601, \"Competency to Testify in General.\"\n   - The last amendment to Rule 601 as of 2021 was a stylistic restyling to make the rule more easily understood, as indicated in the committee notes.\n   - The word deleted in the last amendment could be a term that was deemed unnecessary or redundant in the restyling process, such as \"otherwise\" or \"provides.\"\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Article VI**: Given that Article VI is explicitly titled \"Witnesses\" and contains multiple rules related to witnesses, it is a strong candidate for the article with the most titles containing \"witnesses.\"\n- **Rule 601**: Rule 601 is the first rule in Article VI, making it the target for the last amendment check.\n- **Stylistic Restyling**: The 2011 amendment notes indicate that the changes were primarily stylistic, suggesting that any deletions were likely aimed at improving clarity and consistency rather than changing substantive content. Common words like \"otherwise\" or \"provides\" are often targeted in such restyling efforts.\n\nLet's proceed to confirm these educated guesses by checking the detailed amendment history for Rule 601.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Focus**: The previous attempts involved broad scrolling and searching without a clear, step-by-step approach to finding the specific information needed.\n2. **Inefficient Navigation**: The repeated scrolling up and down did not efficiently lead to the detailed amendment history, which is crucial for identifying the word deleted.\n3. **Missed Key Information**: The detailed amendment history for Rule 601 was not thoroughly examined, leading to a lack of specific information about the last amendment.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to Rule 601**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the page for Rule 601 in the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the \"Notes\" section to find the amendment history.\n\n2. **Identify the Last Amendment**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for the section that details the amendments to Rule 601.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last amendment as of 2021.\n\n3. **Examine the Changes**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compare the text before and after the last amendment to identify the word that was deleted.\n\n4. **Verify the Word Deleted**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the identified word is indeed the one that was deleted in the last amendment.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to Rule 601**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Go to the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on Rule 601, \"Competency to Testify in General.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Find the Amendment History**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the \"Notes\" section.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for the section that details the amendments to Rule 601.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last amendment as of 2021.\n\n- **Step 3: Examine the Changes**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Read the details of the last amendment.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Compare the text before and after the last amendment to identify the word that was deleted.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify the Word Deleted**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Double-check the identified word to ensure it is the correct one.\n\nBy following this plan, we will efficiently navigate to the required information and accurately identify the word deleted in the last amendment to Rule 601."}

Who May Impeach a Witness \n Rule 607. Who May Impeach a Witness \n Any party, including the party that called the witness, may attack the witness’s credibility. \n Notes \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n The traditional rule against impeaching one's own witness is abandoned as based on false premises. A party does not hold out his witnesses as worthy of belief, since he rarely has a free choice in selecting them. Denial of the right leaves the party at the mercy of the witness and the adversary. If the impeachment is by a prior statement, it is free from hearsay dangers and is excluded from the category of hearsay under Rule 801(d)(1). Ladd, Impeachment of One's Own Witness—New Developments 4 U.Chi.L.Rev. 69 (1936); McCormick §38; 3 Wigmore §§896–918. The substantial inroads into the old rule made over the years by decisions, rules, and statutes are evidence of doubts as to its basic soundness and workability. Cases are collected in 3 Wigmore §905. Revised Rule 32(a)(1) of the \n Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  allows any party to impeach a witness by means of his deposition, and Rule 43(b) has allowed the calling and impeachment of an adverse party or person identified with him. Illustrative statutes allowing a party to impeach his own witness under varying circumstances are Ill.Rev. Stats.1967, c. 110, §60; Mass.Laws Annot. 1959, c. 233 §23; 20 N.M.Stats. Annot. 1953, §20–2–4; N.Y. CPLR §4514 (McKinney 1963); 12 Vt.Stats. Annot. 1959, §§1641a, 1642. Complete judicial rejection of the old rule is found in United States v. Freeman, \n 302 F.2d 347  (2d Cir. 1962). The same result is reached in Uniform Rule 20; California Evidence Code §785; Kansas Code of Civil Procedure §60–420. See also New Jersey Evidence Rule 20. \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment \n The amendment is technical.

Competency to Testify in General \n Rule 601. Competency to Testify in General \n Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise. But in a civil case, state law governs the witness’s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision. \n Notes \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds of incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are religious belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the litigation as a party or interested person or spouse of a party or interested person. With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's Acts, American jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize these grounds. \n The Dead Man's Acts are surviving traces of the common law disqualification of parties and interested persons. They exist in variety too great to convey conviction of their wisdom and effectiveness. These rules contain no provision of this kind. For the reasoning underlying the decision not to give effect to state statutes in diversity cases, see the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 501. \n No mental or moral qualifications for testifying as a witness are specified. Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore §§501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty. This result may, however, be accomplished more directly, and without haggling in terms of legal standards, by the manner of administering the oath or affirmation under Rule 603. \n Admissibility of religious belief as a ground of impeachment is treated in Rule 610. Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Federal Rules of Evidence Toolbox \nWex: \nEvidence: Overview\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@graph\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"BreadcrumbList\",\n                \"itemListElement\": [\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 1,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu\",\n                            \"name\": \"LII\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 2,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre\",\n                            \"name\": \"Federal Rules of Evidence\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 5,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_601\",\n                            \"name\": \"\\nRule 601.

Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93–650 \n Rule 601 as submitted to the Congress provided that “Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules.” One effect of the Rule as proposed would have been to abolish age, mental capacity, and other grounds recognized in some State jurisdictions as making a person incompetent as a witness. The greatest controversy centered around the Rule's rendering inapplicable in the federal courts the so-called Dead Man's Statutes which exist in some States. Acknowledging that there is substantial disagreement as to the merit of Dead Man's Statutes, the Committee nevertheless believed that where such statutes have been enacted they represent State policy which should not be overturned in the absence of a compelling federal interest. The Committee therefore amended the Rule to make competency in civil actions determinable in accordance with State law with respect to elements of claims or defenses as to which State law supplies the rule of decision. Cf. \n Courtland v. Walston & Co., Inc  ., 340 F.Supp. 1076, 1087–1092 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93–1277 \n The amendment to rule 601 parallels the treatment accorded rule 501 discussed immediately above. \n Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No. 93–1597 \n Rule 601 deals with competency of witnesses. Both the House and Senate bills provide that federal competency law applies in criminal cases. In civil actions and proceedings, the House bill provides that state competency law applies “to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision.” The Senate bill provides that “in civil actions and proceedings arising under \n 28 U.S.C. §1332  or \n 28 U.S.C. §1335  , or between citizens of different States and removed under \n 28 U.S.C. §1441(b)  the competency of a witness, person, government, State or political subdivision thereof is determined in accordance with State law, unless with respect to the particular claim or defense, Federal law supplies the rule of decision.” \n The wording of the House and Senate bills differs in the treatment of civil actions and proceedings. The rule in the House bill applies to evidence that relates to “an element of a claim or defense.” If an item of proof tends to support or defeat a claim or defense, or an element of a claim or defense, and if state law supplies the rule of decision for that claim or defense, then state competency law applies to that item of proof. \n For reasons similar to those underlying its action on Rule 501, the Conference adopts the House provision. \n Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment \n The language of Rule 601 has been amended as part of the restyling of the Evidence Rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only. There is no intent to change any result in any ruling on evidence admissibility. \nSponsored ListingsAdam Dayan\nPREMIUM\nSan Antonio, TXImmigration Law\nWebsite\nEmail\nProfile\nMohammad Abuershaid\nPREMIUM\n(866) 811-4255Los Angeles, CACriminal Law, DUI & DWI, Personal Injury, Juvenile Law, Domestic Violence, White Collar Crime\nWebsite\nEmail\nProfile\nRodney Mesriani\nPREMIUM\n(866) 500-7070Santa Monica, CAEmployment Law, Personal Injury\nWebsite\nEmail\nProfile\nAlan Ahdoot\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and revised educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The source for the information is the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n   - The focus is on the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.\n   - The fifth section of federal rules alphabetically is the \"Federal Rules of Evidence.\"\n   - The task involves identifying the word deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021.\n   - Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence is titled \"Witnesses\" and contains multiple rules related to witnesses.\n   - The last amendment to Rule 601, \"Competency to Testify in General,\" was in 2011, as part of a restyling effort to make the rules more easily understood and to ensure consistency in style and terminology.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact titles of the rules within Article VI of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n   - The specific article within the Federal Rules of Evidence that has the most titles containing \"witnesses.\"\n   - The text of the first rule in this article.\n   - The detailed history of amendments to this rule, specifically the last amendment as of 2021.\n   - The word that was deleted in the last amendment to this rule.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Determining which article within the Federal Rules of Evidence has the most titles containing \"witnesses\" based on the list of articles found in the fifth section.\n   - Identifying the specific changes made in the last amendment to the first rule in the identified article.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Article VI**: Article VI, \"Witnesses,\" is likely the article with the most titles containing \"witnesses\" within the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n   - **Rule 601**: Rule 601, \"Competency to Testify in General,\" is the first rule in Article VI, making it the target for the last amendment check.\n   - **Stylistic Restyling**: The 2011 amendment notes indicate that the changes were primarily stylistic, suggesting that any deletions were likely aimed at improving clarity and consistency rather than changing substantive content.\n   - **Word Deleted**: The word deleted in the last amendment could be a term that was deemed unnecessary or redundant in the restyling process, such as \"otherwise\" or \"provides.\"\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Article VI**: Given that Article VI is explicitly titled \"Witnesses\" and contains multiple rules related to witnesses, it is a strong candidate for the article with the most titles containing \"witnesses.\"\n- **Rule 601**: Rule 601 is the first rule in Article VI, making it the target for the last amendment check.\n- **Stylistic Restyling**: The 2011 amendment notes indicate that the changes were primarily stylistic, suggesting that any deletions were likely aimed at improving clarity and consistency rather than changing substantive content. Common words like \"otherwise\" or \"provides\" are often targeted in such restyling efforts.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Navigate to Rule 601**: Go to the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute, navigate to the Federal Rules of Evidence, and click on Rule 601, \"Competency to Testify in General.\"\n2. **Find the Amendment History**: Scroll down to the 'Notes' section to find the amendment history for Rule 601.\n3. **Identify the Last Amendment**: Identify the last amendment as of 2021 and the word that was deleted in that amendment.\n\nLet's proceed to confirm these educated guesses by checking the detailed amendment history for Rule 601. \n\nGo to the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute, navigate to the Federal Rules of Evidence, and click on Rule 601, \"Competency to Testify in General.\" Then, scroll down to the 'Notes' section to find the amendment history.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Focus**: The previous attempts involved broad scrolling and searching without a clear, step-by-step approach to finding the specific information needed.\n2. **Inefficient Navigation**: The repeated scrolling up and down did not efficiently lead to the detailed amendment history, which is crucial for identifying the word deleted.\n3. **Missed Key Information**: The detailed amendment history for Rule 601 was not thoroughly examined, leading to a lack of specific information about the last amendment.\n4. **Repetition of Mistakes**: The same steps were repeated without addressing the root causes, leading to inefficiency and lack of progress.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to Rule 601**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the page for Rule 601 in the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on Rule 601, \"Competency to Testify in General.\"\n\n2. **Find the Amendment History**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the \"Notes\" section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for the section that details the amendments to Rule 601.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last amendment as of 2021.\n\n3. **Examine the Changes**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Read the details of the last amendment.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compare the text before and after the last amendment to identify the word that was deleted.\n\n4. **Verify the Word Deleted**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the identified word is indeed the one that was deleted in the last amendment.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to Rule 601**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Go to the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Click on Rule 601, \"Competency to Testify in General.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Find the Amendment History**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the \"Notes\" section.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for the section that details the amendments to Rule 601.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Identify the last amendment as of 2021.\n\n- **Step 3: Examine the Changes**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Read the details of the last amendment.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Compare the text before and after the last amendment to identify the word that was deleted.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify the Word Deleted**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Double-check the identified word to ensure it is the correct one.\n\nBy following this plan, we will efficiently navigate to the required information and accurately identify the word deleted in the last amendment to Rule 601."}

Competency to Testify in General \n Rule 601. Competency to Testify in General \n Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise. But in a civil case, state law governs the witness’s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision. \n Notes \n (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) \n Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules \n This general ground-clearing eliminates all grounds of incompetency not specifically recognized in the succeeding rules of this Article. Included among the grounds thus abolished are religious belief, conviction of crime, and connection with the litigation as a party or interested person or spouse of a party or interested person. With the exception of the so-called Dead Man's Acts, American jurisdictions generally have ceased to recognize these grounds. \n The Dead Man's Acts are surviving traces of the common law disqualification of parties and interested persons. They exist in variety too great to convey conviction of their wisdom and effectiveness. These rules contain no provision of this kind. For the reasoning underlying the decision not to give effect to state statutes in diversity cases, see the Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 501. \n No mental or moral qualifications for testifying as a witness are specified. Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore §§501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty. This result may, however, be accomplished more directly, and without haggling in terms of legal standards, by the manner of administering the oath or affirmation under Rule 603. \n Federal Rules of Evidence Toolbox \nWex: \nEvidence: Overview\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@graph\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"BreadcrumbList\",\n                \"itemListElement\": [\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 1,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu\",\n                            \"name\": \"LII\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 2,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre\",\n                            \"name\": \"Federal Rules of Evidence\"\n                        }\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"@type\": \"ListItem\",\n                        \"position\": 5,\n                        \"item\": {\n                            \"@id\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_601\",\n                            \"name\": \"\\nRule 601.

Standards of mental capacity have proved elusive in actual application. A leading commentator observes that few witnesses are disqualified on that ground. Weihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 53 (1965). Discretion is regularly exercised in favor of allowing the testimony. A witness wholly without capacity is difficult to imagine. The question is one particularly suited to the jury as one of weight and credibility, subject to judicial authority to review the sufficiency of the evidence. 2 Wigmore §§501, 509. Standards of moral qualification in practice consist essentially of evaluating a person's truthfulness in terms of his own answers about it. Their principal utility is in affording an opportunity on voir dire examination to impress upon the witness his moral duty. This result may, however, be accomplished more directly, and without haggling in terms of legal standards, by the manner of administering the oath or affirmation under Rule 603. \n Admissibility of religious belief as a ground of impeachment is treated in Rule 610. Conviction of crime as a ground of impeachment is the subject of Rule 609. Marital relationship is the basis for privilege under Rule 505. Interest in the outcome of litigation and mental capacity are, of course, highly relevant to credibility and require no special treatment to render them admissible along with other matters bearing upon the perception, memory, and narration of witnesses. \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, House Report No. 93–650 \n Rule 601 as submitted to the Congress provided that “Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided in these rules.” One effect of the Rule as proposed would have been to abolish age, mental capacity, and other grounds recognized in some State jurisdictions as making a person incompetent as a witness. The greatest controversy centered around the Rule's rendering inapplicable in the federal courts the so-called Dead Man's Statutes which exist in some States. Acknowledging that there is substantial disagreement as to the merit of Dead Man's Statutes, the Committee nevertheless believed that where such statutes have been enacted they represent State policy which should not be overturned in the absence of a compelling federal interest. The Committee therefore amended the Rule to make competency in civil actions determinable in accordance with State law with respect to elements of claims or defenses as to which State law supplies the rule of decision. Cf. \n Courtland v. Walston & Co., Inc  ., 340 F.Supp. 1076, 1087–1092 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). \n Notes of Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Report No. 93–1277 \n The amendment to rule 601 parallels the treatment accorded rule 501 discussed immediately above. \n Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No. 93–1597 \n Rule 601 deals with competency of witnesses. Both the House and Senate bills provide that federal competency law applies in criminal cases. In civil actions and proceedings, the House bill provides that state competency law applies “to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision.” The Senate bill provides that “in civil actions and proceedings arising under \n 28 U.S.C. §1332  or \n 28 U.S.C. §1335  , or between citizens of different States and removed under \n 28 U.S.C. §1441(b)  the competency of a witness, person, government, State or political subdivision thereof is determined in accordance with State law, unless with respect to the particular claim or defense, Federal law supplies the rule of decision.” \n The wording of the House and Senate bills differs in the treatment of civil actions and proceedings. The rule in the House bill applies to evidence that relates to “an element of a claim or defense.” If an item of proof tends to support or defeat a claim or defense, or an element of a claim or defense, and if state law supplies the rule of decision for that claim or defense, then state competency law applies to that item of proof. \n For reasons similar to those underlying its action on Rule 501, the Conference adopts the House provision. \n Committee Notes on Rules—2011 Amendment \nSponsored ListingsAlan Ahdoot\nPREMIUM\n(866) 806-2940Los Angeles, CAPersonal Injury, Products Liability, Animal & Dog Law, Consumer Law, Elder Law, Nursing Home Abuse\nWebsite\nEmail\nProfile\nJames L.
