{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The reference point for this information is the end of 2022.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The identity of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n   - The photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n   - The text, specifically the last line of the rhyme, under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None directly; the information required is either given or needs to be looked up.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard likely has a chronological order or some indication of when flavors were retired, which could help identify the oldest flavor.\n   - The background headstone in the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone might be a well-known or significant flavor, possibly one that was retired around the same time or had a notable presence in the company's history.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Oldest Flavor's Headstone:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n  - Locate the section that lists flavors by the date they were retired or provides a chronological order.\n  - Identify the oldest flavor's headstone as of the end of 2022.\n\n- **Find the Photo of the Oldest Flavor's Headstone:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to find the specific photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n  - Ensure the photo includes the background headstone.\n\n- **Extract the Last Line of the Rhyme:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to zoom in or enhance the image if necessary.\n  - Read and extract the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background.\n\n- **Verify the Information:**\n  - Double-check the extracted information to ensure accuracy.\n  - If necessary, use WebSurfer to cross-reference with other sources or images.\n\n- **Report the Findings:**\n  - Provide the last line of the rhyme as the final answer."}

Case in point: the deliciously somber Flavor Graveyard located on the grounds of their factory in Waterbury, Vermont.Opened in 1997, the memorial to bygone flavors was originally an online-only affair, until a handful of resin headstones were mocked up and planted on a hill behind the factory. Like a pet cemetery for punny ice cream recipes, each grave marker was given a clever epitaph that summed up the life and death of the flavor. Dearly de-pinted flavors (Ben & Jerry’s term) include fan favorites like Turtle Soup, Fossil Fuel, and of course, Wavy Gravy. Some of the flavors ended up in the ground due to bad sales, while others met stranger fates. Each of the headstones also bears the birth and death dates of the flavors.

Visitors can either take a factory tour which includes a visit to the cemetery, or they can come and pay their respects individually. Luckily, sometimes flavors are resurrected.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The reference point for this information is the end of 2022.\n   - The oldest flavor in the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard as of 2022 is Devil’s Food Chocolate, which lasted from 1996 to 2001.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The photo of the Devil’s Food Chocolate headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n   - The text, specifically the last line of the rhyme, under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the Devil’s Food Chocolate headstone.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None directly; the information required is either given or needs to be looked up.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard likely has a chronological order or some indication of when flavors were retired, which could help identify the oldest flavor.\n   - The background headstone in the photo of the Devil’s Food Chocolate headstone might be a well-known or significant flavor, possibly one that was retired around the same time or had a notable presence in the company's history.\n   - Given that the Devil’s Food Chocolate is the oldest flavor in the graveyard, the background headstone might belong to another early flavor that was retired shortly after or around the same period. This could provide a clue about the type of flavor and the style of the epitaph.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- Since Devil’s Food Chocolate is the oldest flavor, it is likely that the background headstone belongs to a flavor that was also retired early in the company's history. This narrows down the potential candidates to flavors that were introduced and retired in the late 1990s or early 2000s.\n- The style of the epitaphs in the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard is often playful and humorous, which suggests that the background headstone will likely have a similar tone. This can help in identifying the last line of the rhyme once we find a clear image of the headstone.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Access Issues:** The direct link to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard was inaccessible, leading to an \"Access Denied\" error.\n- **Lack of Specific Image:** The search for a specific image of the Devil’s Food Chocolate headstone did not yield a clear, high-resolution image where the background headstone was readable.\n- **Insufficient Detail in Searches:** The searches were not focused enough on finding detailed images or specific information about the background headstone.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Use Alternative Sources:** Focus on finding alternative sources that might have detailed images or descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n- **Refine Image Search:** Use more specific keywords and filters to find high-resolution images of the Devil’s Food Chocolate headstone.\n- **Check Social Media and Blogs:** Look for user-generated content, such as blog posts or social media posts, that might have detailed photos of the flavor graveyard.\n- **Cross-Reference Information:** Verify the information found with multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Steps:\n- **Search for Detailed Images:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for \"high-resolution images of Devil’s Food Chocolate headstone Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022.\"\n  - Apply filters to find images with higher resolution and more detail.\n- **Explore Social Media and Blogs:**\n  - Search for blog posts, Instagram, or other social media platforms where users might have shared detailed photos of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n  - Look for posts specifically mentioning the Devil’s Food Chocolate headstone.\n- **Check Archival Sources:**\n  - Search for archived versions of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page using the Wayback Machine or other archival tools.\n  - Look for detailed images or descriptions of the headstones in these archives.\n- **Cross-Reference Information:**\n  - Once a potential image is found, use WebSurfer to cross-reference the information with other sources to ensure the accuracy of the last line of the rhyme.\n- **Extract the Last Line:**\n  - Zoom in on the image to clearly read the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background.\n  - Extract and verify the last line of the rhyme.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Use Specific Keywords:** Include terms like \"high-resolution,\" \"detailed,\" \"clear,\" and \"background headstone\" in your search queries.\n- **Check User Reviews and Photos:** Websites like TripAdvisor or Yelp often have user-submitted photos that might include detailed views of the flavor graveyard.\n- **Utilize Image Filters:** On image search engines, use filters to find images with higher resolution and more detail.\n- **Verify with Multiple Sources:** Always double-check the information found with at least one additional source to ensure accuracy."}

All These Ice Creams\nAugust 4, 2019 By \nstephen \n1 CommentShae and I have been to Vermont 3 times so far on our \n5 year, 50 state road trip and there’s only one thing we’ve done each time we’ve been there – visited Ben & Jerry’s in Waterbury.\nThe first time we visited we did a full tour (you can read more about the \nBen & Jerry’s Factory Tour here), then we just went for ice cream while doing a \nfood and drink tour around central Vermont.\nMost recently, Shae’s parents came to visit Vermont, so we took them on a tour of all our favorite things which, needless to say, included a visit to Ben & Jerry’s to go on a tour and get some ice cream. The last part of the visit was a tour of the Flavor Graveyard.\nPrimary Sidebar\nWe're Stephen & Shae Pepper and this is our dog Truffles.

Is there a flavor you once loved but is no longer sold in stores? There’s a good chance you’ll find it here, so come and pay your respects.\nThere’s a headstone dedicated to each of the flavors, with each one reminding you of what the ice cream was made of and an epitaph befitting each flavor.\nHow Many Flavors Are In The Flavor Graveyard?At the time of our visit, there were 40 flavors. I’m not sure if newly \nretired deceased flavors are added to the existing flavors, or if they only have a maximum of 40 flavor headstones at a time.\nWhere Is The Flavor Graveyard?The Flavor Graveyard can be found at the main Ben & Jerry’s factory in Waterbury, Vermont. The address is 1281 Waterbury Stowe Rd Route 100, Waterbury, VT 05676.\nWhen you arrive, head up the stairs from the parking lot towards the factory entrance. Head past the entrance and keep following the path. You’ll see signs for the Flavor Graveyard along the way and you’ll pass a playground just before you get there.\nSearch this website\nCategories\nBehind The ScenesBest And Worst ThingsBoatingBudgetingCredit CardsFlight ReviewsFlyingFood And DrinkHotel ReviewsHotel Room RecipesHotelsInternational TravelProduct ReviewsRestaurant ReviewsRoad Trip Mistakes\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

You can check it out for free even without going on a tour or buying ice cream. I highly recommend doing both of those though as they’re only ~$4 each.\nWhat’s My Favorite Flavor In The Flavor Graveyard?I’m almost certain you didn’t ask this in your head, but I’ll tell you anyway. I can’t stand the Dave Matthews Band – they’re one of the dullest bands that’s ever been inflicted on the planet – but their Ben & Jerry’s flavor sounded amazing. It was called Dave Matthews Band’s Magic Brownies and contained black raspberry ice cream swirled with sweet cream ice cream and fudgy brownies.\nI’d never heard of it before visiting Ben & Jerry’s and so I’m a little relieved that I never got to try it – that way I don’t have to live in sorrow the rest of my life having tasted its amazingness but not being able to experience its sweet, sweet taste anymore.\nWhat Flavors Are In The Flavor Graveyard?You might not have asked this either, but I doubt you’d have read this far if you weren’t at least a little interested. As I mentioned earlier, there were 40 flavors in the graveyard when we visited, so here’s a list of what they all are.\nThe headstones have a description of their flavors. They’re a little hard to see in the photos below though, so I’ve typed those out, along with the epitaphs to the ice creams that appear on the headstones.\nRoad Trip MistakesRoad Trip PreparationRoad Trip StatsRoad Trip TipsThings To DoTravel ThrowbacksUncategorizedTags\nAirbnb \nAlabama \nAnimals \nArizona \nArt \nBeachesBurgers \nCalifornia \nColorado \nCraft Beer \nDistilleriesDonuts \nFree Things To Do \nHikingHilton \nHistoric Homes \nHyatt \nHyatt Place \nIce CreamIHG \nIllinois \nKansas \nKentucky \nLakes \nMarriottMountains \nMuseums \nNational MonumentsNational Parks \nNew Mexico \nOhio \nPet-Friendly Things To DoQuirky Things To Do \nRivers \nRock Formations \nSculpture Hunting \nSouth Carolina \nState Parks \nTexas \nVirginia \nWaterfalls \nWhiskey \nWineWine Tasting \nWisconsin\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n- The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n- The reference point for this information is the end of 2022.\n- The oldest flavor in the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard as of 2022 is Devil’s Food Chocolate, which lasted from 1996 to 2001.\n\n#### 2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n- The photo of the Devil’s Food Chocolate headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n- The text, specifically the last line of the rhyme, under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the Devil’s Food Chocolate headstone.\n\n#### 3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n- None directly; the information required is either given or needs to be looked up.\n\n#### 4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n- **Chronological Order:** The Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard likely has a chronological order or some indication of when flavors were retired, which could help identify the oldest flavor.\n- **Background Headstone Significance:** The background headstone in the photo of the Devil’s Food Chocolate headstone might be a well-known or significant flavor, possibly one that was retired around the same time or had a notable presence in the company's history.\n- **Early Retirements:** Given that the Devil’s Food Chocolate is the oldest flavor in the graveyard, the background headstone might belong to another early flavor that was retired shortly after or around the same period. This narrows down the potential candidates to flavors that were introduced and retired in the late 1990s or early 2000s.\n- **Playful Epitaphs:** The style of the epitaphs in the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard is often playful and humorous, which suggests that the background headstone will likely have a similar tone. This can help in identifying the last line of the rhyme once we find a clear image of the headstone.\n- **Common Themes:** Flavors that were retired early might share common themes or ingredients, which could provide additional clues about the background headstone.\n\n#### **Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Chronological Order:** Since the flavors are likely arranged chronologically, the background headstone could be from a flavor that was retired shortly after Devil’s Food Chocolate. This helps narrow down the search.\n- **Background Headstone Significance:** Significant flavors often have memorable epitaphs, which could be more likely to be captured in detailed photos.\n- **Early Retirements:** Flavors from the late 1990s or early 2000s are more likely to be featured in the background of the oldest flavor's headstone, as they are part of the same era.\n- **Playful Epitaphs:** The playful and humorous style of the epitaphs can guide us in recognizing the correct headstone and its inscription.\n- **Common Themes:** Early flavors often share common themes or ingredients, which can help in identifying the background headstone by process of elimination.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Search for Detailed Images:** Continue searching for high-resolution images of the Devil’s Food Chocolate headstone and the background headstone.\n- **Check Social Media and Blogs:** Look for user-generated content, such as blog posts or social media posts, that might have detailed photos of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n- **Archival Sources:** Check the Wayback Machine or other archival tools for older versions of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page.\n- **Cross-Reference Information:** Verify the information found with multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to locate the specific image and extract the last line of the rhyme on the background headstone.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Ineffective Search Queries:** The search queries used were too broad and did not yield the specific high-resolution images or detailed content needed.\n- **Lack of Specific Filters:** The image search filters were not effectively applied to find high-resolution images.\n- **Limited Exploration of Social Media and Blogs:** The search for user-generated content on social media and travel blogs was not thorough enough.\n- **Overlooking Archival Sources:** The Wayback Machine and other archival tools were not fully utilized to find older versions of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Refine Search Queries:** Use more specific and targeted search queries to find high-resolution images and detailed content.\n- **Apply Image Filters:** Use advanced image search filters to find high-resolution images.\n- **Thoroughly Explore Social Media and Blogs:** Conduct a more detailed search on platforms like Instagram, Reddit, and travel blogs for user-generated content.\n- **Utilize Archival Tools:** Check the Wayback Machine and other archival tools for older versions of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page.\n- **Cross-Reference Information:** Verify the information found with multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Steps:\n- **Refine Search Queries:**\n  - Use specific keywords: \"high-resolution image Devil’s Food Chocolate headstone Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard 2022\"\n  - Include additional terms: \"detailed photo,\" \"close-up,\" \"background headstone\"\n\n- **Apply Image Filters:**\n  - On image search engines, apply filters for high resolution, recent, and large images.\n  - Use advanced search options to narrow down the results.\n\n- **Thoroughly Explore Social Media and Blogs:**\n  - Search Instagram for hashtags like #BenAndJerrysGraveyard, #DevilsFoodChocolate, #FlavorGraveyard\n  - Search Reddit for subreddits related to Ben & Jerry's or ice cream, and look for posts with detailed photos.\n  - Search travel blogs and personal blogs for detailed visits to the Ben & Jerry's factory and flavor graveyard.\n\n- **Utilize Archival Tools:**\n  - Use the Wayback Machine to find older versions of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page.\n  - Look for archived images and detailed descriptions of the headstones.\n\n- **Cross-Reference Information:**\n  - Verify the information found with multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n  - Cross-check the details of the background headstone with official Ben & Jerry's documentation and user-generated content.\n\n### Hints:\n- **Use Specific Keywords:** Include terms like \"high-resolution,\" \"detailed,\" \"close-up,\" and \"background headstone\" in your search queries.\n- **Check User Reviews and Photos:** Websites like TripAdvisor or Yelp often have user-submitted photos that might include detailed views of the flavor graveyard.\n- **Utilize Image Filters:** On image search engines, use filters to find images with higher resolution and more detail.\n- **Verify with Multiple Sources:** Always double-check the information found with at least one additional source to ensure accuracy."}
