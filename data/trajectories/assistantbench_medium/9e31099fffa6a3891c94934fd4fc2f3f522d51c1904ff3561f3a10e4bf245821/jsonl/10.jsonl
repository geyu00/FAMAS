{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The question specifically asks which of these C-suite members did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The current C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The date of monday.com's IPO.\n   - The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of its IPO.\n   - Sources: \n     - Monday.com's official website for current C-suite information.\n     - SEC filings, press releases, or financial news articles for IPO details and historical C-suite information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Compare the current C-suite members with those who were in place at the time of the IPO to identify any changes in positions.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that some C-suite members have been with the company since before the IPO, while others may have joined more recently.\n   - Commonly, startups undergo changes in leadership as they grow and go public, so it is plausible that at least one current C-suite member was not in a C-suite role during the IPO.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify Current C-Suite Members**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find the current C-suite members of monday.com. Visit the official monday.com website or other reliable sources to gather this information.\n\n- **Step 2: Determine the Date of IPO**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for the date of monday.com's IPO. This information can typically be found in press releases, financial news articles, or the company's official communications.\n\n- **Step 3: Identify C-Suite Members at the Time of IPO**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for historical information on the C-suite members at the time of the IPO. This can be found in SEC filings, press releases, or news articles around the IPO date.\n\n- **Step 4: Compare C-Suite Members**\n  - **Assistant**: Compare the current C-suite members with those who were in place at the time of the IPO to identify any changes in positions.\n\n- **Step 5: Identify the C-Suite Member Who Was Not in Position During IPO**\n  - **Assistant**: Based on the comparison, determine which current C-suite member was not in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n- **Step 6: Verify and Report Findings**\n  - **Assistant**: Verify the findings and prepare a concise report answering the original request."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The question specifically asks which of these C-suite members did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The IPO date of monday.com was June 10, 2021.\n   - The company went public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol MNDY, with shares priced at $155.00 per ordinary share.\n   - Current C-suite members of monday.com include:\n     - Roy Mann, Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Director\n     - Eran Zinman, Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Director\n     - Eliran Glazer, Chief Financial Officer\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of its IPO on June 10, 2021.\n   - Sources:\n     - Press releases, SEC filings, or financial news articles from around the IPO date for historical C-suite information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Compare the current C-suite members with those who were in place at the time of the IPO to identify any changes in positions.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that Roy Mann and Eran Zinman, as co-founders and co-CEOs, were in their current C-suite roles during the IPO.\n   - Given the significant changes that often occur in startups as they prepare for and go through an IPO, it is plausible that Eliran Glazer, the CFO, may have joined the C-suite more recently or held a different role at the time of the IPO.\n   - Other current C-suite members may have joined the company after the IPO, but we need to verify this information from official sources.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Roy Mann and Eran Zinman**: As co-founders and co-CEOs, it is highly likely that they have been in their current roles since the company's early stages, including the IPO.\n- **Eliran Glazer**: The role of CFO is crucial during an IPO, but it is common for companies to bring in experienced financial leaders as they prepare for such a significant event. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Eliran Glazer may have joined the C-suite more recently or held a different role at the time of the IPO.\n- **Other C-suite members**: Without specific names and roles, it is difficult to make accurate guesses, but it is common for startups to undergo leadership changes as they scale and go public. We need to verify the exact composition of the C-suite at the time of the IPO to confirm this.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Information**: The search queries did not yield specific press releases or SEC filings that listed the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n2. **Repetition of Queries**: The same search terms were used multiple times without variation, leading to redundant results.\n3. **Inadequate Exploration of Sources**: We did not thoroughly explore different types of sources, such as official company press releases, SEC filings, or detailed financial news articles.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Queries**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Use more specific search terms to find detailed information about the C-suite members at the time of the IPO. For example, search for \"monday.com C-suite members June 10, 2021 press release\" or \"monday.com IPO prospectus C-suite members.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Explore Official Company Communications**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the official monday.com website and look for the investor relations section. This section often contains press releases and other official communications related to the IPO.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for the IPO prospectus on the SEC website (sec.gov) using the company name and IPO date.\n\n- **Step 3: Cross-Reference Multiple Sources**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information found in press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles to ensure accuracy.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for interviews or articles from the time of the IPO that might mention the C-suite members.\n\n- **Step 4: Compare Current and Historical C-Suite Members**\n  - **Assistant**: Once the historical C-suite members are identified, compare them with the current C-suite members to determine who was not in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n- **Step 5: Verify and Report Findings**\n  - **Assistant**: Verify the findings by cross-referencing multiple sources and prepare a concise report answering the original request.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Queries**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"monday.com C-suite members June 10, 2021 press release.\"\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"monday.com IPO prospectus C-suite members.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Explore Official Company Communications**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the official monday.com website and navigate to the investor relations section.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for the IPO prospectus on the SEC website (sec.gov).\n\n- **Step 3: Cross-Reference Multiple Sources**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for interviews or articles from the time of the IPO that mention the C-suite members.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information found in press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles.\n\n- **Step 4: Compare Current and Historical C-Suite Members**\n  - **Assistant**: Compare the current C-suite members with those who were in place at the time of the IPO.\n\n- **Step 5: Verify and Report Findings**\n  - **Assistant**: Verify the findings and prepare a concise report answering the original request.\n\nBy following this new plan, we aim to avoid the previous issues and ensure that we gather the necessary information to accurately answer the question."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and refined educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The question specifically asks which of these C-suite members did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The IPO date of monday.com was June 10, 2021.\n   - The company went public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol MNDY, with shares priced at $155.00 per ordinary share.\n   - Current C-suite members of monday.com include:\n     - Roy Mann, Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Director\n     - Eran Zinman, Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Director\n     - Eliran Glazer, Chief Financial Officer\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of its IPO on June 10, 2021.\n   - Sources:\n     - Press releases, SEC filings, or financial news articles from around the IPO date for historical C-suite information.\n     - Official company communications, such as the investor relations section of the monday.com website.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Compare the current C-suite members with those who were in place at the time of the IPO to identify any changes in positions.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Roy Mann and Eran Zinman**: As co-founders and co-CEOs, it is highly likely that they have been in their current C-suite roles since the company's early stages, including the IPO.\n   - **Eliran Glazer**: Given the critical nature of the CFO role during an IPO, it is plausible that Eliran Glazer was either already in the CFO position or held a senior financial role at the time of the IPO. However, it is also common for companies to bring in experienced financial leaders just before or shortly after an IPO. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Eliran Glazer may have joined the C-suite more recently or held a different role at the time of the IPO.\n   - **Other C-suite members**: Without specific names and roles, it is difficult to make accurate guesses, but it is common for startups to undergo leadership changes as they scale and go public. We need to verify the exact composition of the C-suite at the time of the IPO to confirm this.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Roy Mann and Eran Zinman**: As co-founders and co-CEOs, it is highly likely that they have been in their current roles since the company's early stages, including the IPO. Their leadership roles are foundational to the company's success.\n- **Eliran Glazer**: The role of CFO is crucial during an IPO, and companies often ensure they have strong financial leadership in place. However, it is also common for startups to bring in experienced financial leaders just before or shortly after an IPO. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Eliran Glazer may have joined the C-suite more recently or held a different role at the time of the IPO.\n- **Other C-suite members**: Without specific names and roles, it is difficult to make accurate guesses, but it is common for startups to undergo leadership changes as they scale and go public. We need to verify the exact composition of the C-suite at the time of the IPO to confirm this.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Search for Official Documents**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the SEC website (sec.gov) and search for the IPO prospectus of monday.com using the company name and IPO date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for press releases from around June 10, 2021, that list the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n\n2. **Explore Investor Relations**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the investor relations section of the monday.com website and look for press releases or other official communications related to the IPO.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information found in press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Compare Current and Historical C-Suite Members**:\n   - **Assistant**: Once the historical C-suite members are identified, compare them with the current C-suite members to determine who was not in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n5. **Verify and Report Findings**:\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the findings by cross-referencing multiple sources and prepare a concise report answering the original request.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to gather the necessary information to accurately answer the question.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Information**: The search queries did not yield specific press releases or SEC filings that listed the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n2. **Repetition of Queries**: The same search terms were used multiple times without variation, leading to redundant results.\n3. **Inadequate Exploration of Sources**: We did not thoroughly explore different types of sources, such as official company press releases, SEC filings, or detailed financial news articles.\n4. **Insufficient Navigation**: We did not navigate effectively within the websites to find the relevant sections, such as the investor relations page on the monday.com website.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Queries**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Use more specific and varied search terms to find detailed information about the C-suite members at the time of the IPO. For example, search for \"monday.com C-suite members June 10, 2021 press release\" and \"monday.com IPO prospectus C-suite members.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Explore Official Company Communications**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the official monday.com website and navigate to the investor relations section. This section often contains press releases and other official communications related to the IPO.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for the IPO prospectus on the SEC website (sec.gov) using the company name and IPO date.\n\n- **Step 3: Cross-Reference Multiple Sources**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information found in press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles to ensure accuracy.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for interviews or articles from the time of the IPO that might mention the C-suite members.\n\n- **Step 4: Compare Current and Historical C-Suite Members**\n  - **Assistant**: Once the historical C-suite members are identified, compare them with the current C-suite members to determine who was not in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n- **Step 5: Verify and Report Findings**\n  - **Assistant**: Verify the findings by cross-referencing multiple sources and prepare a concise report answering the original request.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Queries**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"monday.com C-suite members June 10, 2021 press release.\"\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"monday.com IPO prospectus C-suite members.\"\n\n- **Step 2: Explore Official Company Communications**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the official monday.com website and navigate to the investor relations section.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for the IPO prospectus on the SEC website (sec.gov).\n\n- **Step 3: Cross-Reference Multiple Sources**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for interviews or articles from the time of the IPO that mention the C-suite members.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information found in press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles.\n\n- **Step 4: Compare Current and Historical C-Suite Members**\n  - **Assistant**: Compare the current C-suite members with those who were in place at the time of the IPO.\n\n- **Step 5: Verify and Report Findings**\n  - **Assistant**: Verify the findings and prepare a concise report answering the original request.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Use Specific and Varied Search Terms**: Ensure that search terms are specific and varied to avoid redundant results.\n- **Thoroughly Explore Different Sources**: Do not rely solely on one type of source. Explore press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles.\n- **Navigate Effectively Within Websites**: Ensure that you navigate to the relevant sections of the websites, such as the investor relations page, to find the necessary information.\n- **Cross-Reference Information**: Always cross-reference information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with any new insights and refined educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the C-suite members of monday.com.\n   - The question specifically asks which of these C-suite members did not hold a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The IPO date of monday.com was June 10, 2021.\n   - The company went public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol MNDY, with shares priced at $155.00 per ordinary share.\n   - Current C-suite members of monday.com include:\n     - Roy Mann, Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Director\n     - Eran Zinman, Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Director\n     - Eliran Glazer, Chief Financial Officer\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of its IPO on June 10, 2021.\n   - Sources:\n     - Press releases, SEC filings, or financial news articles from around the IPO date for historical C-suite information.\n     - Official company communications, such as the investor relations section of the monday.com website.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Compare the current C-suite members with those who were in place at the time of the IPO to identify any changes in positions.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Roy Mann and Eran Zinman**: As co-founders and co-CEOs, it is highly likely that they have been in their current C-suite roles since the company's early stages, including the IPO. Their leadership roles are foundational to the company's success.\n   - **Eliran Glazer**: Given the critical nature of the CFO role during an IPO, it is plausible that Eliran Glazer was either already in the CFO position or held a senior financial role at the time of the IPO. However, it is also common for companies to bring in experienced financial leaders just before or shortly after an IPO. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Eliran Glazer may have joined the C-suite more recently or held a different role at the time of the IPO.\n   - **Other C-suite members**: Without specific names and roles, it is difficult to make accurate guesses, but it is common for startups to undergo leadership changes as they scale and go public. We need to verify the exact composition of the C-suite at the time of the IPO to confirm this.\n\n### Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Roy Mann and Eran Zinman**: As co-founders and co-CEOs, it is highly likely that they have been in their current roles since the company's early stages, including the IPO. Their leadership roles are foundational to the company's success.\n- **Eliran Glazer**: The role of CFO is crucial during an IPO, and companies often ensure they have strong financial leadership in place. However, it is also common for startups to bring in experienced financial leaders just before or shortly after an IPO. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Eliran Glazer may have joined the C-suite more recently or held a different role at the time of the IPO. Given the importance of financial stability during an IPO, it is less likely that he was not in a C-suite position, but this needs verification.\n- **Other C-suite members**: Without specific names and roles, it is difficult to make accurate guesses, but it is common for startups to undergo leadership changes as they scale and go public. We need to verify the exact composition of the C-suite at the time of the IPO to confirm this.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Search for Official Documents**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the SEC website (sec.gov) and search for the IPO prospectus of monday.com using the company name and IPO date.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Look for press releases from around June 10, 2021, that list the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n\n2. **Explore Investor Relations**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the investor relations section of the monday.com website and look for press releases or other official communications related to the IPO.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information found in press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Compare Current and Historical C-Suite Members**:\n   - **Assistant**: Once the historical C-suite members are identified, compare them with the current C-suite members to determine who was not in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n5. **Verify and Report Findings**:\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the findings by cross-referencing multiple sources and prepare a concise report answering the original request.\n\n### Additional Steps to Ensure Accuracy:\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for interviews or articles from the time of the IPO that might mention the C-suite members.\n- **WebSurfer**: Check the company's LinkedIn page for historical updates or changes in leadership roles around the IPO date.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to gather the necessary information to accurately answer the question. Let's proceed with the next steps to find the required information. \n\nPlease navigate to the investor relations section of the monday.com website and look for press releases or other official communications related to the IPO, particularly those that list the C-suite members at the time of the IPO. Additionally, search for the IPO prospectus on the SEC website (sec.gov) using the company name and IPO date.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Ineffective Navigation**: We did not effectively navigate to the investor relations section of the monday.com website, which likely contains the most relevant information.\n2. **Redundant Searches**: We repeated similar search queries without variation, leading to redundant results.\n3. **Lack of Specificity**: The search terms used were not specific enough to find the exact press releases or SEC filings that list the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n4. **Insufficient Exploration**: We did not thoroughly explore different types of sources, such as detailed financial news articles or the SEC website.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Investor Relations Section**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the official monday.com website and navigate to the investor relations section.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for press releases, SEC filings, or other official communications related to the IPO.\n\n- **Step 2: Search for Specific Press Releases**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Use specific search terms to find press releases from around June 10, 2021, that list the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"monday.com IPO press release June 10, 2021\" and \"monday.com C-suite members June 10, 2021.\"\n\n- **Step 3: Search the SEC Website**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the SEC website (sec.gov) and search for the IPO prospectus of monday.com using the company name and IPO date.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for the S-1 filing, which typically includes detailed information about the company's leadership at the time of the IPO.\n\n- **Step 4: Cross-Reference Information**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information found in press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles to ensure accuracy.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for interviews or articles from the time of the IPO that might mention the C-suite members.\n\n- **Step 5: Compare Current and Historical C-Suite Members**\n  - **Assistant**: Once the historical C-suite members are identified, compare them with the current C-suite members to determine who was not in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n- **Step 6: Verify and Report Findings**\n  - **Assistant**: Verify the findings by cross-referencing multiple sources and prepare a concise report answering the original request.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Use Specific and Varied Search Terms**: Ensure that search terms are specific and varied to avoid redundant results.\n- **Thoroughly Explore Different Sources**: Do not rely solely on one type of source. Explore press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles.\n- **Navigate Effectively Within Websites**: Ensure that you navigate to the relevant sections of the websites, such as the investor relations page, to find the necessary information.\n- **Cross-Reference Information**: Always cross-reference information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the Investor Relations Section**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the official monday.com website and navigate to the investor relations section.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for press releases, SEC filings, or other official communications related to the IPO.\n\n- **Step 2: Search for Specific Press Releases**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Use specific search terms to find press releases from around June 10, 2021, that list the C-suite members at the time of the IPO.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"monday.com IPO press release June 10, 2021\" and \"monday.com C-suite members June 10, 2021.\"\n\n- **Step 3: Search the SEC Website**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the SEC website (sec.gov) and search for the IPO prospectus of monday.com using the company name and IPO date.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for the S-1 filing, which typically includes detailed information about the company's leadership at the time of the IPO.\n\n- **Step 4: Cross-Reference Information**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the information found in press releases, SEC filings, and financial news articles to ensure accuracy.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Look for interviews or articles from the time of the IPO that might mention the C-suite members.\n\n- **Step 5: Compare Current and Historical C-Suite Members**\n  - **Assistant**: Once the historical C-suite members are identified, compare them with the current C-suite members to determine who was not in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n- **Step 6: Verify and Report Findings**\n  - **Assistant**: Verify the findings by cross-referencing multiple sources and prepare a concise report answering the original request.\n\nPlease start by navigating to the investor relations section of the monday.com website and look for press releases or other official communications related to the IPO."}
