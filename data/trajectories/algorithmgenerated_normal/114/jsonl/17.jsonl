{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "To address the task effectively, we must first gather the necessary information about the sample dataset and the function used to find the smallest house. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline of how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Review the Sample Dataset**: We need to examine the dataset to confirm that it includes properties with at least 2 beds and 2 baths sold in the specified timeframe and location. Additionally, we'll check that the square footage data is accurate and representative of similar properties in Prince Edward Island.\n\n2. **Verify the Function**: We will look at the code for the function designed to filter and identify the smallest house meeting the criteria. This will involve checking its logic, the filtering process, and how it selects the house with the minimum square footage.\n\n3. **Identify Issues**: If any discrepancies are found during our review, we will document them and suggest necessary corrections.\n\nTo get started, I need the sample dataset and the function code. Please provide these details for me to perform the verification process."}
