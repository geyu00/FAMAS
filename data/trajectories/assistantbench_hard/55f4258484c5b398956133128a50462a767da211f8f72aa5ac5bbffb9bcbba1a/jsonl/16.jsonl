Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series must be rated according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of all series Ted Danson has starred in.\n   - Number of seasons for each of these series.\n   - Availability of these series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Rotten Tomatoes ratings for these series.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify which of the series meet the criteria of having more than 1 season.\n   - Determine the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating among the qualifying series.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Ted Danson has starred in several series, including \"Cheers,\" \"The Good Place,\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" but it's not immediately clear which of these have more than one season and are available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - \"The Good Place\" is highly rated, so it is unlikely to be the worst-rated series.\n   - \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" is not primarily known for Ted Danson's starring role, though he has appeared in it.\n   - Lesser-known series like \"Bored to Death\" or \"Damages\" might be candidates, but their availability and ratings need verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for a comprehensive list of TV series starring Ted Danson.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to filter the list to include only those series with more than 1 season.\n- **Step 3:** Use WebSurfer to check the availability of these series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- **Step 4:** Use WebSurfer to find the Rotten Tomatoes ratings for the qualifying series.\n- **Step 5:** Compare the Rotten Tomatoes ratings to identify the series with the lowest score.\n- **Step 6:** Verify the final result to ensure accuracy."}

Born Edward Bridge Danson III on December 29, 1947 in San Diego, California, he was raised near Flagstaff, Arizona and attended Stanford University, where he developed an interest in drama during his second year. Danson transferred to Carnegie-Mellon and earned his bachelor's degree in fine arts in 1972; initial fame as a contract player on daytime soap prompted a move to Los Angeles in 1978, where he trained at the Actor's Studio while finding steady work as a guest actor on episodic television. He received early positive notices as an ill-fated police officer in the Joseph Wambaugh-penned crime drama \"The Onion Field\" (1979), but the film's success did little for his career, and Danson soon returned to guest work, as well as a series of widely-seen television commercials for Aramis cologne. But perseverance, as well as a well-received turn as William Hurt's lawyer pal in Lawrence Kasdan's \"Body Heat\" (1981), eventually led to his breakout showcase as ex-baseball pitcher turned bar owner Sam Malone on \"Cheers.\" Though the lowest-rated program on television in its debut season, \"Cheers\" slowly built an audience over successive seasons and became one of NBC's biggest hits of the 1980s; Danson's talent for light comedy and romance - especially in concert with co-star Shelley Long's Diane Chambers - helped to make the comedy appointment television, and earned Danson 11 consecutive Emmy nominations and nine Golden Globe nods, of which he won two apiece. The success of \"Cheers\" naturally led to other acting opportunities for Danson in features, though few of these could generate similar responses from audiences save for \"3 Men and a Baby\" (1987), a charming comedy with Danson, Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg as bachelors pressed into raising an infant. However, he scored a personal triumph in a challenging role - a father convicted of incest - in the TV-movie \"Something About Amelia\" (ABC, 1984), which earned him a third Golden Globe - and remained one of television's most popular actors as \"Cheers\" drew to a close in 1993. But Danson nearly derailed his standing with a widely publicized affair with actor/comedian Whoopi Goldberg; the news of Danson leaving his second wife, Cassandra \"Casey\" Coates, who had suffered a stroke during the birth of their second child, as well as his disastrously-received appearance in blackface at a Friars Club tribute to Goldberg undid some of the goodwill generated by his work on \"Cheers.\" Though Danson remained busy in the wake of the incident, the work was largely unremarkable, save for a brief appearance in Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), though Peter Medak's \"Pontiac Moon\" (1994) would introduce him to actress Mary Steenburgen, who would become his third wife in 1995. He eventually returned to television, first in \"Ink\" (CBS, 1996-97) with Steenburgen, and later in the more successful \"Becker\" (CBS, 1998-2004), with Danson as a cantankerous doctor, and recurring appearances as a more exasperated version of himself on \"Curb Your Enthusiam\" (HBO, 2000-) But in 2007, Danson underwent something of a career renaissance when he was cast as a scandal-shrouded billionaire in the first season of \"Damages.\" His performance - equal parts charm and malevolent - wowed critics and audiences alike, and earned Danson two Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe nod. More importantly, it opened up a new venue of characters to the actor, who stepped nimbly into character roles that were far afield from Sam Malone: the prickly forensic botanist D.B. Russell, who stepped into William Petersen's shoes on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"; the giddy, pot-smoking editor friend of Jonathan Ames (Jason Schwartzman) on the cult favorite \"Bored to Death\" (HBO, 2009-2011); a phlegmatic Midwestern sheriff on Season 2 of \"Fargo\" (FX, 2014- ); and a demon with a moral crisis on \"The Good Place,\" which earned him two additional Emmy awards. In 2019, Danson was announced as the lead of a new series by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock (\"30 Rock\", NBC, 2006-2013) about a businessman who runs for mayor of Los Angeles for entirely wrong reasons. \n Show More \nHighest-Rated Movies\nSaving Private Ryan\nHearts Beat Loud\n News & Interviews for\nTed Danson 10 Shows To Watch If You Love \nOnly Murders in the Building Quentin Tarantino’s \nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood Leads Critics Choice Awards with Four Wins, including Best Picture \n 12 TV Shows You Should Binge-Watch This September \n View All\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Person\",\n        \"url\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ted_danson\",\n        \"name\": \"Ted Danson\",\n        \"birthDate\": \"1947-12-29\",\n        \"birthPlace\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Place\",\n            \"name\": \"San Diego, California, USA\"\n        },\n        \"description\": \"Explore the complete filmography of Ted Danson on Rotten Tomatoes!

However, that may end when Patty's son, Michael, sues for custody of the little girl. When Patty's protege, Ellen Parsons, agrees to testify as a character witness for Michael at the custody trial, Patty scrambles to prevent her from taking the stand, fearing that Ellen will reveal Patty's secrets. To prevent the testimony, Patty refers Channing McClaren, a famous computer hacker, to Ellen, knowing that she will not be able to resist taking on such a high-profile client having just launched her own firm. When Patty files a lawsuit against McClaren -- whom Ellen has agreed to represent -- the judge in the custody case rules that Ellen cannot take the stand until the McClaren case is resolved. \nWatch on Fandango at Home\n Buy Now \nWhere to Watch\nSeasons\nCast & Crew\nMore Like This\nPhotos\nMedia Info\nWhat to Watch\nIn Theaters\nAt Home\nTV Shows\nNew TV Tonight\n View All \nNew TV TonightUntamed\n88%\nRevival\n93%\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds\n95%\nSuch Brave Girls\n100%\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"TVSeries\",\n        \"actor\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Glenn Close\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/glenn_close\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/A-ZqXYk0nogufeGFI_sTOvSeGug=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/337_v9_bc.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Rose Byrne\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/rose_byrne\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/QF-hAGSv2UHWra5LmnuwRHxva2g=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/84172_v9_bb.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Ryan Phillippe\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ryan_philippe\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/145d8hW4Cw0U5PsclY8Csly7tg4=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/74089_v9_bc.jpg\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"aggregateRating\": {\n            \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n            \"bestRating\": \"100\",\n            \"description\": \"The Tomatometer rating \\u2013 based on the published opinions of hundreds of film and television critics \\u2013 is a trusted measurement of movie and TV programming quality for millions of moviegoers.
