{"agent": "GameTheory_Expert", "content": "To find the minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game given the constraints, we will go through the steps outlined in the plan.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the constraints and conditions\n1. There are 30 shiny prop coins distributed among three boxes.\n2. One box must contain at least 2 coins.\n3. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.\n\nLet the number of coins in the three boxes be represented as \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\). The following conditions must hold:\n- \\(x + y + z = 30\\)\n- \\(x \\geq 2\\)\n- Without loss of generality, letâ€™s assume \\(x < y\\), then \\(y = x + 6\\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine possible values for coins\nFrom the equations, we can express \\(z\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n- If \\(y = x + 6\\), then:\n\\[\nz = 30 - x - y = 30 - x - (x + 6) = 30 - 2x - 6 = 24 - 2x\n\\]\n\nSo we need:\n1. \\(x \\geq 2\\)\n2. \\(24 - 2x \\geq 0\\) (since \\(z\\) must also be non-negative)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the valid ranges for \\(x\\)\nFrom the inequality \\(24 - 2x \\geq 0\\):\n\\[\n2x \\leq 24 \\implies x \\leq 12\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(x\\) can take values from 2 to 12.\n\n### Step 4: Finding possible configurations\nGiven the equations, we can summarize the values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\):\n- For each valid \\(x\\) in the range [2, 12], we have:\n  - \\(y = x + 6\\)\n  - \\(z = 24 - 2x\\)\n\n### Step 5: Calculate each configuration\nLet's calculate the configurations for each valid \\(x\\):\n\n1. If \\(x = 2\\):\n   - \\(y = 8\\)\n   - \\(z = 20\\)\n   \n2. If \\(x = 3\\):\n   - \\(y = 9\\)\n   - \\(z = 18\\)\n\n3. If \\(x = 4\\):\n   - \\(y = 10\\)\n   - \\(z = 16\\)\n\n4. If \\(x = 5\\):\n   - \\(y = 11\\)\n   - \\(z = 14\\)\n\n5. If \\(x = 6\\):\n   - \\(y = 12\\)\n   - \\(z = 12\\)\n\n6. If \\(x = 7\\):\n   - \\(y = 13\\)\n   - \\(z = 10\\)\n\n7. If \\(x = 8\\):\n   - \\(y = 14\\)\n   - \\(z = 8\\)\n\n8. If \\(x = 9\\):\n   - \\(y = 15\\)\n   - \\(z = 6\\)\n\n9. If \\(x = 10\\):\n   - \\(y = 16\\)\n   - \\(z = 4\\)\n\n10. If \\(x = 11\\):\n    - \\(y = 17\\)\n    - \\(z = 2\\)\n\n11. If \\(x = 12\\):\n    - \\(y = 18\\)\n    - \\(z = 0\\) (invalid as \\(z\\) cannot be zero)\n\n### Step 6: Optimal strategy for winning coins\nBob should guess the number of coins in the boxes such that:\n- He guesses exactly the number of coins in the box, which ensures he wins that number.\n\n### Minimum Amount Calculation\nTo minimize his winnings while guessing optimally, we should choose the lowest valid distribution which is when \\(x = 2\\), \\(y = 8\\), \\(z = 20\\).\n\n**Optimal guesses**:\n- Guess \\(2\\) coins for the first box.\n- Guess \\(8\\) coins for the second box.\n- Guess \\(20\\) coins for the third box.\n\n### Total Minimum Amount of Money\nCalculating the winnings:\n- Bob wins \\(2 + 8 + 20 = 30\\) coins.\n\nSince each coin is worth $1,000, the minimum amount of money Bob can win is:\n\\[\n30 \\times 1000 = 30000\n\\]\n\n### Final Result\nThe minimum amount of money Bob can win from the game is **$30,000**. \n\nThis analysis provides Bob with a strategic approach to winning the coins based on the defined constraints."}

The reasoning holds consistent across the constraints and optimal strategy outlined.\n\nIf everyone agrees with this analysis, we can conclude the discussion.\n\nTERMINATE"}
