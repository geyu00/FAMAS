{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Magic: The Gathering Standard card (non-foil paper version released in its original set) that was banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns (including Oko, Crown of Thorns) had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The card must be a non-foil paper version.\n   - The card must have been released in its original set.\n   - The card must have been banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns.\n   - The card must have had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact date when Oko, Thief of Crowns (and Oko, Crown of Thorns) were banned.\n   - A list of all cards banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns.\n   - The historical price data for each of these cards, including their all-time high and all-time low prices.\n   - The specific sets in which these cards were originally released.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The price decrease for each card from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n   - The card with the highest price decrease among those banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Cards that were popular and heavily played in competitive formats are more likely to have experienced significant price fluctuations.\n   - Cards that were banned due to their power level or impact on the game might have seen larger price drops, as their value in competitive play would have diminished significantly.\n   - The card in question is likely to be one of the more expensive and impactful cards banned alongside Oko, Thief of Crowns.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Determine the Ban Date for Oko, Thief of Crowns**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for the official Wizards of the Coast (WotC) announcement or article that lists the ban date for Oko, Thief of Crowns and the other cards banned at the same time.\n\n- **Step 2: List All Cards Banned at the Same Time as Oko, Thief of Crowns**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of cards banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns from the WotC announcement.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify the Original Sets of the Banned Cards**\n  - **WebSurfer**: For each card in the list, verify the original set in which it was released. This information can often be found on the card's page on the official Magic: The Gathering website or on Gatherer.\n\n- **Step 4: Collect Historical Price Data for Each Banned Card**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Use a reliable source like MTG Goldfish, TCGplayer, or Cardmarket to collect the historical price data for each card, including their all-time high and all-time low prices.\n\n- **Step 5: Calculate the Price Decrease for Each Card**\n  - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to calculate the price decrease for each card using the collected data.\n  - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script to compute the price decreases.\n\n- **Step 6: Identify the Card with the Highest Price Decrease**\n  - **Assistant**: Analyze the results from the Python script to identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n- **Step 7: Verify and Present the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Double-check the findings and present the final answer, including the card name, the original set, and the price decrease."}
