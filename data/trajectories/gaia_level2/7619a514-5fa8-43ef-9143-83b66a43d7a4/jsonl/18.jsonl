{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when Regression was added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The source of information is GitHub.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific GitHub repository for numpy.\n   - The list of closed issues in the numpy repository.\n   - The issues labeled as \"Regression\" within the numpy.polynomial module.\n   - The creation date of the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue.\n   - Determining which of the closed issues is the oldest among those labeled as \"Regression.\"\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The numpy repository on GitHub is likely to be well-maintained and have detailed issue tracking.\n   - The \"Regression\" label is commonly used to mark issues where a previously working feature has stopped functioning.\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is likely to be from a time when the numpy.polynomial module was undergoing significant changes or updates.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the numpy GitHub repository URL**.\n- **Use WebSurfer to navigate to the numpy GitHub repository**.\n- **Use WebSurfer to filter closed issues with the \"Regression\" label and \"numpy.polynomial\" in the title or description**.\n- **Sort the filtered issues by the oldest creation date**.\n- **Identify the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label**.\n- **Extract the creation date of the identified issue**.\n- **Format the date in MM/DD/YY format**.\n- **Report the formatted date back to the user**."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding the date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed `numpy.polynomial` issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n   - The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n   - The source of information is GitHub.\n   - The specific GitHub repository for numpy is `numpy/numpy`.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of closed issues in the `numpy` repository.\n   - The issues labeled as \"Regression\" within the `numpy.polynomial` module.\n   - The creation date of the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n   - The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue.\n   - Determining which of the closed issues is the oldest among those labeled as \"Regression.\"\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The `numpy` repository on GitHub is likely to be well-maintained and have detailed issue tracking.\n   - The \"Regression\" label is commonly used to mark issues where a previously working feature has stopped functioning.\n   - The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is likely to be from a time when the `numpy.polynomial` module was undergoing significant changes or updates.\n   - The search filters on GitHub might need to be adjusted to ensure that we are capturing all relevant issues, as the initial search did not return any results.\n   - It is possible that the \"Regression\" label was added to issues after they were initially created, so the creation date of the issue might not directly reflect when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n**Additional Hunches and Reasoning:**\n- **Manual Inspection Required:** Given that the search filters did not return any results, it might be necessary to manually inspect the closed issues with the \"Regression\" label to identify those related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Label Addition Date:** The date when the \"Regression\" label was added to an issue might not be directly available through the search filters. We may need to open each relevant issue and check the timeline of label additions.\n- **Module-Specific Search:** Since the direct search for `numpy.polynomial` issues with the \"Regression\" label did not yield results, we should consider searching for all closed issues with the \"Regression\" label and then manually filter for those involving `numpy.polynomial`.\n\nThese updates and hunches should guide us in refining our approach to finding the required information. Let's proceed with manually inspecting the closed issues with the \"Regression\" label to identify those related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Search Filters Limitation:** The search filters on GitHub did not return any results when trying to find closed issues with the \"Regression\" label that specifically mentioned `numpy.polynomial`. This suggests that either such issues do not exist, or the search filters are not capturing them correctly.\n- **Manual Inspection Needed:** The automated search approach might not be sufficient to find the required issue. Manual inspection of closed issues with the \"Regression\" label is necessary to identify those related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Manually Inspect Closed Issues with \"Regression\" Label:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the `numpy` GitHub repository.\n  - Filter the issues to show only closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n  - Manually scroll through the list of issues and identify those that involve the `numpy.polynomial` module.\n  - Note the creation date of the oldest issue that meets the criteria.\n- **Check Label Addition Date:**\n  - For the identified issue, open it and check the timeline to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- **Format the Date:**\n  - Convert the date to the MM/DD/YY format.\n- **Report the Result:**\n  - Provide the formatted date back to the user.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the `numpy` GitHub Repository:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to the `numpy` GitHub repository: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`.\n2. **Filter Closed Issues with \"Regression\" Label:**\n   - In the Issues section, use the search bar to filter for `is:issue is:closed label:Regression sort:created-asc`.\n3. **Manually Inspect Issues:**\n   - Scroll through the list of issues and identify those that mention `numpy.polynomial` in the title or description.\n4. **Note the Creation Date:**\n   - Identify the oldest issue that meets the criteria and note its creation date.\n5. **Check Label Addition Date:**\n   - Open the identified issue and check the timeline to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n6. **Format the Date:**\n   - Convert the date to the MM/DD/YY format.\n7. **Report the Result:**\n   - Provide the formatted date back to the user.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes:\n- **Ensure Correct Search Filters:** Double-check the search filters to ensure they are set correctly to show closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Manual Verification:** Manually verify the issues to ensure that they involve the `numpy.polynomial` module.\n- **Check Timeline for Label Addition:** Do not assume the creation date of the issue is the same as the date the \"Regression\" label was added. Check the issue timeline for the exact date.\n\nLet's proceed with this plan. WebSurfer, please navigate to the `numpy` GitHub repository and filter the issues to show only closed issues with the \"Regression\" label, sorted by the oldest creation date."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about finding the date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed `numpy.polynomial` issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n- The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n- The source of information is GitHub.\n- The specific GitHub repository for numpy is `numpy/numpy`.\n- The search for closed issues with the \"Regression\" label and the keyword \"numpy.polynomial\" did not return any results on the initial page.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The list of closed issues in the `numpy` repository.\n- The issues labeled as \"Regression\" within the `numpy.polynomial` module.\n- The creation date of the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n- The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue.\n- Determining which of the closed issues is the oldest among those labeled as \"Regression.\"\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The `numpy` repository on GitHub is likely to be well-maintained and have detailed issue tracking.\n- The \"Regression\" label is commonly used to mark issues where a previously working feature has stopped functioning.\n- The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is likely to be from a time when the `numpy.polynomial` module was undergoing significant changes or updates.\n- The search filters on GitHub might need to be adjusted to ensure that we are capturing all relevant issues, as the initial search did not return any results.\n- It is possible that the \"Regression\" label was added to issues after they were initially created, so the creation date of the issue might not directly reflect when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n\n#### Additional Hunches and Reasoning:\n- **Manual Inspection Required:** Given that the search filters did not return any results, it might be necessary to manually inspect the closed issues with the \"Regression\" label to identify those related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Label Addition Date:** The date when the \"Regression\" label was added to an issue might not be directly available through the search filters. We may need to open each relevant issue and check the timeline of label additions.\n- **Module-Specific Search:** Since the direct search for `numpy.polynomial` issues with the \"Regression\" label did not yield results, we should consider searching for all closed issues with the \"Regression\" label and then manually filter for those involving `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Pagination Issue:** The search results might be spread across multiple pages, so we need to ensure we scroll through all pages to find the relevant issues.\n\n### Updated Plan\n1. **Navigate to the `numpy` GitHub Repository:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to the `numpy` GitHub repository: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`.\n2. **Filter Closed Issues with \"Regression\" Label:**\n   - In the Issues section, use the search bar to filter for `is:issue is:closed label:Regression sort:created-asc`.\n3. **Manually Inspect Issues:**\n   - Scroll through the list of issues and identify those that mention `numpy.polynomial` in the title or description.\n4. **Note the Creation Date:**\n   - Identify the oldest issue that meets the criteria and note its creation date.\n5. **Check Label Addition Date:**\n   - For the identified issue, open it and check the timeline to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n6. **Format the Date:**\n   - Convert the date to the MM/DD/YY format.\n7. **Report the Result:**\n   - Provide the formatted date back to the user.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **Navigate to the `numpy` GitHub Repository:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to the `numpy` GitHub repository: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`.\n2. **Filter Closed Issues with \"Regression\" Label:**\n   - In the Issues section, use the search bar to filter for `is:issue is:closed label:Regression sort:created-asc`.\n3. **Manually Inspect Issues:**\n   - Scroll through the list of issues and identify those that mention `numpy.polynomial` in the title or description.\n4. **Note the Creation Date:**\n   - Identify the oldest issue that meets the criteria and note its creation date.\n5. **Check Label Addition Date:**\n   - For the identified issue, open it and check the timeline to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n6. **Format the Date:**\n   - Convert the date to the MM/DD/YY format.\n7. **Report the Result:**\n   - Provide the formatted date back to the user.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n- **Ensure Correct Search Filters:** Double-check the search filters to ensure they are set correctly to show closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Manual Verification:** Manually verify the issues to ensure that they involve the `numpy.polynomial` module.\n- **Check Timeline for Label Addition:** Do not assume the creation date of the issue is the same as the date the \"Regression\" label was added. Check the issue timeline for the exact date.\n- **Scroll Through All Pages:** Ensure you scroll through all pages of search results to capture all relevant issues.\n\nLet's proceed with this plan. WebSurfer, please navigate to the `numpy` GitHub repository and filter the issues to show only closed issues with the \"Regression\" label, sorted by the oldest creation date. Then, manually inspect the issues to find those related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Initial Search Filters Did Not Yield Results:** The search query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression numpy.polynomial sort:created-asc` did not return any results on the first page, suggesting that the relevant issues might be spread across multiple pages or that the search criteria might need refinement.\n- **Manual Inspection Was Not Thorough Enough:** We did not scroll through all pages of the search results, which could have led to missing the relevant issues.\n- **Label Addition Date Not Directly Available:** The date when the \"Regression\" label was added is not directly available in the search results, requiring manual inspection of each issue's timeline.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Navigate to the `numpy` GitHub Repository:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to the `numpy` GitHub repository: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`.\n2. **Filter Closed Issues with \"Regression\" Label:**\n   - In the Issues section, use the search bar to filter for `is:issue is:closed label:Regression sort:created-asc`.\n3. **Manually Inspect All Pages of Results:**\n   - Scroll through all pages of the search results to ensure no relevant issues are missed.\n4. **Identify Issues Related to `numpy.polynomial`:**\n   - Manually inspect each issue to identify those that mention `numpy.polynomial` in the title or description.\n5. **Note the Creation Date of the Oldest Relevant Issue:**\n   - Identify the oldest issue that meets the criteria and note its creation date.\n6. **Check the Timeline for the Label Addition Date:**\n   - For the identified issue, open it and check the timeline to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n7. **Format the Date:**\n   - Convert the date to the MM/DD/YY format.\n8. **Report the Result:**\n   - Provide the formatted date back to the user.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **Navigate to the `numpy` GitHub Repository:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to the `numpy` GitHub repository: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`.\n2. **Filter Closed Issues with \"Regression\" Label:**\n   - In the Issues section, use the search bar to filter for `is:issue is:closed label:Regression sort:created-asc`.\n3. **Manually Inspect All Pages of Results:**\n   - Scroll through all pages of the search results to ensure no relevant issues are missed.\n4. **Identify Issues Related to `numpy.polynomial`:**\n   - Manually inspect each issue to identify those that mention `numpy.polynomial` in the title or description.\n5. **Note the Creation Date of the Oldest Relevant Issue:**\n   - Identify the oldest issue that meets the criteria and note its creation date.\n6. **Check the Timeline for the Label Addition Date:**\n   - For the identified issue, open it and check the timeline to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n7. **Format the Date:**\n   - Convert the date to the MM/DD/YY format.\n8. **Report the Result:**\n   - Provide the formatted date back to the user.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n- **Ensure Correct Search Filters:** Double-check the search filters to ensure they are set correctly to show closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Manual Verification:** Manually verify the issues to ensure that they involve the `numpy.polynomial` module.\n- **Check Timeline for Label Addition:** Do not assume the creation date of the issue is the same as the date the \"Regression\" label was added. Check the issue timeline for the exact date.\n- **Scroll Through All Pages:** Ensure you scroll through all pages of search results to capture all relevant issues.\n- **Be Thorough:** Take the time to thoroughly inspect each issue and its timeline to avoid missing the relevant information.\n\nLet's proceed with this plan. WebSurfer, please navigate to the `numpy` GitHub repository and filter the issues to show only closed issues with the \"Regression\" label, sorted by the oldest creation date.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about finding the date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed `numpy.polynomial` issue that has the \"Regression\" label.\n- The date format requested is MM/DD/YY.\n- The source of information is GitHub.\n- The specific GitHub repository for numpy is `numpy/numpy`.\n- The search for closed issues with the \"Regression\" label and the keyword \"numpy.polynomial\" did not return any results on the initial page.\n- The search for closed issues with the \"Regression\" label, sorted by creation date (both ascending and descending), did not return any results on the first page.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The list of closed issues in the `numpy` repository.\n- The issues labeled as \"Regression\" within the `numpy.polynomial` module.\n- The creation date of the oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label.\n- The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added to the oldest closed issue.\n- Determining which of the closed issues is the oldest among those labeled as \"Regression.\"\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The `numpy` repository on GitHub is likely to be well-maintained and have detailed issue tracking.\n- The \"Regression\" label is commonly used to mark issues where a previously working feature has stopped functioning.\n- The oldest closed issue with the \"Regression\" label is likely to be from a time when the `numpy.polynomial` module was undergoing significant changes or updates.\n- The search filters on GitHub might need to be adjusted to ensure that we are capturing all relevant issues, as the initial search did not return any results.\n- It is possible that the \"Regression\" label was added to issues after they were initially created, so the creation date of the issue might not directly reflect when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n- The search might be missing issues due to pagination or filtering limitations. We should manually inspect all pages of the search results.\n\n#### Additional Hunches and Reasoning:\n- **Manual Inspection Required:** Given that the search filters did not return any results, it might be necessary to manually inspect the closed issues with the \"Regression\" label to identify those related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Label Addition Date:** The date when the \"Regression\" label was added to an issue might not be directly available through the search filters. We may need to open each relevant issue and check the timeline of label additions.\n- **Module-Specific Search:** Since the direct search for `numpy.polynomial` issues with the \"Regression\" label did not yield results, we should consider searching for all closed issues with the \"Regression\" label and then manually filter for those involving `numpy.polynomial`.\n- **Pagination Issue:** The search results might be spread across multiple pages, so we need to ensure we scroll through all pages to find the relevant issues.\n\n### Updated Plan\n1. **Navigate to the `numpy` GitHub Repository:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to the `numpy` GitHub repository: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`.\n2. **Filter Closed Issues with \"Regression\" Label:**\n   - In the Issues section, use the search bar to filter for `is:issue is:closed label:Regression`.\n3. **Manually Inspect All Pages of Results:**\n   - Scroll through all pages of the search results to ensure no relevant issues are missed.\n4. **Identify Issues Related to `numpy.polynomial`:**\n   - Manually inspect each issue to identify those that mention `numpy.polynomial` in the title or description.\n5. **Note the Creation Date of the Oldest Relevant Issue:**\n   - Identify the oldest issue that meets the criteria and note its creation date.\n6. **Check the Timeline for the Label Addition Date:**\n   - For the identified issue, open it and check the timeline to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n7. **Format the Date:**\n   - Convert the date to the MM/DD/YY format.\n8. **Report the Result:**\n   - Provide the formatted date back to the user.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n1. **Navigate to the `numpy` GitHub Repository:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to the `numpy` GitHub repository: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`.\n2. **Filter Closed Issues with \"Regression\" Label:**\n   - In the Issues section, use the search bar to filter for `is:issue is:closed label:Regression`.\n3. **Manually Inspect All Pages of Results:**\n   - Scroll through all pages of the search results to ensure no relevant issues are missed.\n4. **Identify Issues Related to `numpy.polynomial`:**\n   - Manually inspect each issue to identify those that mention `numpy.polynomial` in the title or description.\n5. **Note the Creation Date of the Oldest Relevant Issue:**\n   - Identify the oldest issue that meets the criteria and note its creation date.\n6. **Check the Timeline for the Label Addition Date:**\n   - For the identified issue, open it and check the timeline to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n7. **Format the Date:**\n   - Convert the date to the MM/DD/YY format.\n8. **Report the Result:**\n   - Provide the formatted date back to the user.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n- **Ensure Correct Search Filters:** Double-check the search filters to ensure they are set correctly to show closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Manual Verification:** Manually verify the issues to ensure that they involve the `numpy.polynomial` module.\n- **Check Timeline for Label Addition:** Do not assume the creation date of the issue is the same as the date the \"Regression\" label was added. Check the issue timeline for the exact date.\n- **Scroll Through All Pages:** Ensure you scroll through all pages of search results to capture all relevant issues.\n- **Be Thorough:** Take the time to thoroughly inspect each issue and its timeline to avoid missing the relevant information.\n\nLet's proceed with this plan. WebSurfer, please navigate to the `numpy` GitHub repository and filter the issues to show only closed issues with the \"Regression\" label. Then, manually inspect all pages of the search results to find issues related to `numpy.polynomial`.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Initial Search Filters Did Not Yield Results:** The search query `is:issue is:closed label:Regression sort:created-asc` did not return any results on the first page, suggesting that the relevant issues might be spread across multiple pages or that the search criteria might need refinement.\n- **Manual Inspection Was Not Thorough Enough:** We did not scroll through all pages of the search results, which could have led to missing the relevant issues.\n- **Label Addition Date Not Directly Available:** The date when the \"Regression\" label was added is not directly available in the search results, requiring manual inspection of each issue's timeline.\n- **Pagination Issue:** The search results might be spread across multiple pages, so we need to ensure we scroll through all pages to find the relevant issues.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Navigate to the `numpy` GitHub Repository:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to go to the `numpy` GitHub repository: `https://github.com/numpy/numpy`.\n2. **Filter Closed Issues with \"Regression\" Label:**\n   - In the Issues section, use the search bar to filter for `is:issue is:closed label:Regression`.\n3. **Manually Inspect All Pages of Results:**\n   - Scroll through all pages of the search results to ensure no relevant issues are missed.\n4. **Identify Issues Related to `numpy.polynomial`:**\n   - Manually inspect each issue to identify those that mention `numpy.polynomial` in the title or description.\n5. **Note the Creation Date of the Oldest Relevant Issue:**\n   - Identify the oldest issue that meets the criteria and note its creation date.\n6. **Check the Timeline for the Label Addition Date:**\n   - For the identified issue, open it and check the timeline to find the exact date when the \"Regression\" label was added.\n7. **Format the Date:**\n   - Convert the date to the MM/DD/YY format.\n8. **Report the Result:**\n   - Provide the formatted date back to the user.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n- **Ensure Correct Search Filters:** Double-check the search filters to ensure they are set correctly to show closed issues with the \"Regression\" label.\n- **Manual Verification:** Manually verify the issues to ensure that they involve the `numpy.polynomial` module.\n- **Check Timeline for Label Addition:** Do not assume the creation date of the issue is the same as the date the \"Regression\" label was added.
