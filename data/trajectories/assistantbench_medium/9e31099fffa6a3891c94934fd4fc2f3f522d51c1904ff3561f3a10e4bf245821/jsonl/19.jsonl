{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about identifying which person in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The current members of the monday.com C-suite.\n   - The date of monday.com's IPO.\n   - The C-suite positions held by each current C-suite member at the time of the IPO.\n   - These facts can be found on the official monday.com website, in press releases, and in SEC filings related to the IPO.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the current C-suite members with their roles at the time of the IPO to identify who was not in a C-suite position then.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that the CEO and other founding members were in C-suite positions during the IPO, but newer additions to the team may not have been.\n   - Given the typical growth trajectory of tech companies, it's possible that some C-suite positions were created post-IPO to support expansion and new initiatives.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Conduct a web search to find the current members of the monday.com C-suite.\n- **WebSurfer**: Identify the date of monday.com's IPO.\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for historical information on the C-suite members' roles at the time of the IPO.\n- **Assistant**: Compile the information gathered by WebSurfer and cross-reference the current C-suite members with their roles at the time of the IPO.\n- **Assistant**: Identify and report which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO."}

While the company has high gross margins, they do spend a significant amount on sales and marketing -- the company spent $63M (107% of revenue) in the most recent quarter. Given their bottoms-up approach, the company needs to spend marketing dollars to drive website traffic, much like a consumer-focused company. Even with heavy marketing spend, the growth of the company has been extremely efficient to date and unlike most SaaS companies, Monday mentions they have spent $121M of cash to finance the growth of the business thus far and has generated $2+ of ARR for every $1 of capital used.

Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about identifying which person in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The IPO date for monday.com was June 14, 2021.\n   - The current members of the monday.com C-suite include:\n     - Roy Mann: Co-Founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer (CEO)\n     - Eran Zinman: Co-Founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer (CEO)\n     - Eliran Glazer: Chief Financial Officer (CFO)\n     - Shiran Nawi: Chief People and Legal Officer\n     - Daniel Lereya: Chief Product and Technology Officer\n     - Adi Dar: Chief Operating Officer\n     - Casey George: Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), appointed effective May 15, 2025\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite positions held by each current C-suite member at the time of the IPO (June 14, 2021).\n   - Specific details about the roles and appointments of the C-suite members around the time of the IPO can be found in the S-1 filing or other regulatory documents.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the current C-suite members with their roles at the time of the IPO to identify who was not in a C-suite position then.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is highly likely that the co-founders, Roy Mann and Eran Zinman, were in C-suite positions during the IPO, given their roles as co-CEOs.\n   - Eliran Glazer, as the CFO, was likely in a C-suite position during the IPO, as financial oversight is crucial during the IPO process.\n   - Shiran Nawi, Daniel Lereya, and Adi Dar may have been in C-suite positions or in key leadership roles during the IPO, but this needs verification.\n   - Casey George, appointed as the Chief Revenue Officer effective May 15, 2025, was clearly not in a C-suite position during the IPO in 2021.\n   - Given the typical growth trajectory of tech companies, it's possible that some C-suite positions were created post-IPO to support expansion and new initiatives, particularly in areas like product, technology, and operations.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Casey George**: Since Casey George was appointed as the Chief Revenue Officer in 2025, it is clear that he was not in a C-suite position during the IPO in 2021.\n- **Other C-suite Members**: For the other current C-suite members, it is reasonable to assume that the co-founders and key financial leaders were in place during the IPO, but additional verification is needed for the others to confirm their roles at that time.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Repetitive Searches**: We repeatedly searched for the same information without refining the search queries or exploring different sources.\n- **Lack of Direct Access to S-1 Filing**: We did not directly access the S-1 filing document, which is the most reliable source for the C-suite roles at the time of the IPO.\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: We navigated through multiple pages without extracting the necessary information efficiently.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Directly Access the S-1 Filing**:\n  - Use a more specific search query to find the S-1 filing document for monday.com.\n  - Navigate to the SEC Edgar database to find the S-1 filing for monday.com.\n- **Extract C-Suite Roles from S-1 Filing**:\n  - Once the S-1 filing is located, extract the section detailing the management team and their roles at the time of the IPO.\n- **Cross-Reference with Current C-Suite**:\n  - Compare the roles listed in the S-1 filing with the current C-suite members to identify who was not in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n- **Summarize and Report**:\n  - Compile the findings and report which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for \"monday.com S-1 filing SEC Edgar\".\n2. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the SEC Edgar database and locate the S-1 filing for monday.com.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Open the S-1 filing document and search for the section detailing the management team and their roles at the time of the IPO.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Extract the relevant information about the C-suite roles at the time of the IPO.\n5. **Assistant**: Cross-reference the extracted roles with the current C-suite members.\n6. **Assistant**: Identify and report which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO."}

Other key executives include Eliran Glazer, CFO; Shiran Nawi, Chief People and Legal Officer; and Daniel Lereya, Chief Product and Technology Officer.\nKey Takeaways\nMonday’s rapid revenue growth, strong gross margins, and large market opportunity make it an attractive investment. The company’s unique platform, which allows users to build custom applications, sets it apart from competitors and positions it well for continued growth.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1\",\n        \"robots\": \"index, follow\",\n        \"og:locale\": \"en_US\",\n        \"og:type\": \"article\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Monday.com IPO | S-1 Breakdown - Meritech Capital\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Monday.com, a leading SaaS project management company, filed for a $100M (placeholder figure) IPO.

Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about identifying which person in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n   - The IPO date for monday.com was June 14, 2021.\n   - The current members of the monday.com C-suite include:\n     - **Roy Mann**: Co-Founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer (CEO)\n     - **Eran Zinman**: Co-Founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer (CEO)\n     - **Eliran Glazer**: Chief Financial Officer (CFO)\n     - **Shiran Nawi**: Chief People and Legal Officer\n     - **Daniel Lereya**: Chief Product and Technology Officer\n     - **Adi Dar**: Chief Operating Officer\n     - **Casey George**: Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), appointed effective May 15, 2025\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The C-suite positions held by each current C-suite member at the time of the IPO (June 14, 2021).\n   - Specific details about the roles and appointments of the C-suite members around the time of the IPO can be found in the S-1 filing or other regulatory documents.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the current C-suite members with their roles at the time of the IPO to identify who was not in a C-suite position then.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Roy Mann and Eran Zinman**: As co-founders and co-CEOs, it is highly likely that they were in C-suite positions during the IPO.\n   - **Eliran Glazer**: As the CFO, it is very likely that he was in a C-suite position during the IPO, given the importance of financial oversight during the IPO process.\n   - **Shiran Nawi**: She is currently the Chief People and Legal Officer. While it is possible she was in a C-suite position during the IPO, this needs verification.\n   - **Daniel Lereya**: He is currently the Chief Product and Technology Officer. It is possible he was in a C-suite position or a key leadership role during the IPO, but this needs verification.\n   - **Adi Dar**: He is currently the Chief Operating Officer. It is possible he was in a C-suite position or a key leadership role during the IPO, but this needs verification.\n   - **Casey George**: Since he was appointed as the Chief Revenue Officer in 2025, it is clear that he was not in a C-suite position during the IPO in 2021.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Casey George**: Since Casey George was appointed as the Chief Revenue Officer in 2025, it is clear that he was not in a C-suite position during the IPO in 2021.\n- **Other C-suite Members**: For the other current C-suite members, it is reasonable to assume that the co-founders and key financial leaders were in place during the IPO, but additional verification is needed for the others to confirm their roles at that time.\n- **Post-IPO Growth**: Given the typical growth trajectory of tech companies, it's possible that some C-suite positions were created post-IPO to support expansion and new initiatives, particularly in areas like product, technology, and operations.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Locate the S-1 Filing**:\n   - Search for 'monday.com S-1 filing PDF' to find a direct link to the PDF version of the S-1 filing.\n   - Alternatively, find a financial news site or a third-party service that provides SEC filings.\n2. **Extract Relevant Information**:\n   - Once the S-1 filing is located, open the document and search for the section detailing the management team and their roles at the time of the IPO.\n   - Extract and provide the relevant information about the C-suite roles at the time of the IPO.\n3. **Cross-Reference with Current C-Suite**:\n   - Compare the roles listed in the S-1 filing with the current C-suite members to identify who was not in a C-suite position during the IPO.\n4. **Summarize and Report**:\n   - Compile the findings and report which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\nWould you like to proceed with locating the S-1 filing again?\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Repetitive Searches**: We repeatedly searched for the same information without refining the search queries or exploring different sources.\n- **Lack of Direct Access to S-1 Filing**: We did not successfully access the S-1 filing document, which is the most reliable source for the C-suite roles at the time of the IPO.\n- **Web Surfer Errors**: There were technical issues with the web surfer, such as timeouts and element not found errors, which prevented us from navigating and extracting information effectively.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Refine Search Queries**: Use more specific search terms to directly find the S-1 filing PDF.\n- **Use Alternative Sources**: If the SEC Edgar database is inaccessible, use financial news sites or third-party services that provide SEC filings.\n- **Manual Verification**: Manually verify the roles of the C-suite members at the time of the IPO using the S-1 filing.\n- **Handle Technical Issues**: Ensure the web surfer has enough time to load pages and handle any elements correctly.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Refined Web Search**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search for 'monday.com S-1 filing PDF' to find a direct link to the PDF version of the S-1 filing.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the SEC Edgar database is still inaccessible, search for 'monday.com S-1 filing financial news site' or 'monday.com S-1 filing third-party service'.\n\n2. **Locate and Open S-1 Filing**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the most relevant link to the S-1 filing PDF.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the page loads completely and navigate to the section detailing the management team and their roles at the time of the IPO.\n\n3. **Extract C-Suite Roles**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the names and roles of the management team at the time of the IPO.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the relevant information and provide it in a structured format.\n\n4. **Cross-Reference with Current C-Suite**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the roles listed in the S-1 filing with the current C-suite members.\n   - **Assistant**: Identify and report which current C-suite member did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\n5. **Handle Technical Issues**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: If any elements are not found or if there are timeouts, retry the action after a short sleep period (e.g., 5 seconds).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the page is fully loaded before attempting to extract information.\n\n### Example Commands\n1. **Refined Web Search**:\n   ```sh\n   I typed 'monday.com S-1 filing PDF' into the browser search bar.\n   ```\n\n2. **Locate and Open S-1 Filing**:\n   ```sh\n   I clicked on the most relevant link to the S-1 filing PDF.\n   ```\n\n3. **Extract C-Suite Roles**:\n   ```sh\n   I navigated to the section detailing the management team and their roles at the time of the IPO.\n   ```\n\n4. **Cross-Reference with Current C-Suite**:\n   ```sh\n   I compared the roles listed in the S-1 filing with the current C-suite members.\n   ```\n\n5. **Handle Technical Issues**:\n   ```sh\n   I waited for the page to fully load before attempting to extract information.\n   ```\n\nLet's start with the refined web search."}
