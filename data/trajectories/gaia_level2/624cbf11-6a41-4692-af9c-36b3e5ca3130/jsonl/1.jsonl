{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on a headstone.\n   - The headstone is visible in the background of a photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - The photo is from the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The information is as of the end of 2022.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The identity of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n   - The specific photo of the oldest flavor's headstone that includes another headstone in the background.\n   - The full text of the rhyme on the headstone visible in the background, particularly the last line.\n\n   **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n   - The Ben & Jerry's official website, specifically the \"Flavor Graveyard\" section.\n   - Any official Ben & Jerry's social media accounts or press releases from 2022.\n   - Archival images or articles about the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard from 2022.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact location of the headstone in the background within the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - The legibility and clarity of the text on the headstone in the background.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The oldest flavor's headstone is likely one of the earliest flavors retired by Ben & Jerry's.\n   - The headstone in the background might be a well-known or significant flavor that was also retired.\n   - The last line of the rhyme could be a play on words or a humorous reference typical of Ben & Jerry's brand.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nCertainly! Here’s a concise plan to address the original request:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use **WebSurfer** to navigate to the Ben & Jerry's official website and locate the \"Flavor Graveyard\" section.\n- **Step 2:** Identify the oldest flavor's headstone in the Flavor Graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n- **Step 3:** Locate the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and identify the headstone visible in the background.\n- **Step 4:** Use **WebSurfer** to zoom in or enhance the image if necessary to read the full text of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n- **Step 5:** Extract and provide the last line of the rhyme from the identified headstone.\n\nThis plan leverages WebSurfer's ability to navigate and interact with web content, which is essential for finding and analyzing the required information. Other team members are not necessary for this task."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on a headstone.\n   - The headstone is visible in the background of a photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - The photo is from the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The information is as of the end of 2022.\n   - The Ben & Jerry's official website is currently experiencing issues and is not accessible directly.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The identity of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n   - The specific photo of the oldest flavor's headstone that includes another headstone in the background.\n   - The full text of the rhyme on the headstone visible in the background, particularly the last line.\n\n   **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n   - Archived versions of the Ben & Jerry's official website, specifically the \"Flavor Graveyard\" section.\n   - Official Ben & Jerry's social media accounts or press releases from 2022.\n   - Archival images or articles about the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard from 2022.\n   - News articles or blog posts that discuss the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact location of the headstone in the background within the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - The legibility and clarity of the text on the headstone in the background.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The oldest flavor's headstone is likely one of the earliest flavors retired by Ben & Jerry's, such as \"Rainforest Crunch\" or \"Peanut Butter and Jelly.\"\n   - The headstone in the background might be a well-known or significant flavor that was also retired, possibly a flavor that was retired around the same time or has a notable history.\n   - The last line of the rhyme could be a play on words or a humorous reference typical of Ben & Jerry's brand, often involving puns or cultural references.\n   - Given the issues with accessing the official website, it is likely that an archived version or a secondary source will be necessary to find the required information.\n\n**REASONING FOR UPDATED GUESSES:**\n- **Oldest Flavor's Headstone:** Early flavors like \"Rainforest Crunch\" and \"Peanut Butter and Jelly\" were among the first to be retired and are likely candidates for being the oldest in the graveyard.\n- **Headstone in the Background:** Significant flavors that have a rich history or were retired around the same time as the oldest flavor are more likely to be featured prominently in the background.\n- **Last Line of the Rhyme:** Ben & Jerry's is known for its playful and humorous approach to naming and describing their flavors, so the last line of the rhyme is likely to be a clever pun or reference.\n- **Archived Versions:** Since the official website is inaccessible, relying on archived versions or secondary sources is a practical approach to gather the necessary information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Website Access Issues:** The Ben & Jerry's official website was inaccessible due to an \"Access Denied\" error, preventing direct access to the Flavor Graveyard section.\n- **Incorrect Navigation:** Some attempts led to unrelated pages, such as a Grubhub delivery page, instead of the intended Flavor Graveyard archive.\n- **Ineffective Search Queries:** The search queries did not yield the specific archived version or detailed information needed to identify the oldest flavor's headstone and the background headstone.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Step 1:** Use **WebSurfer** to search for an archived version of the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard from the end of 2022.\n  - **Search Query:** \"Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard archive 2022 site:web.archive.org\"\n- **Step 2:** Once the archived page is found, navigate to the section containing the oldest flavor's headstone.\n- **Step 3:** Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and locate the headstone visible in the background.\n- **Step 4:** Zoom in or enhance the image to read the full text of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n- **Step 5:** Extract and provide the last line of the rhyme from the identified headstone.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges:\n- **Use the Wayback Machine:** The Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) is a reliable source for archived web pages.\n- **Specific Search Queries:** Use more specific search queries to avoid landing on unrelated pages.\n- **Verify Page Content:** Ensure that the page contains the Flavor Graveyard section and is from the end of 2022.\n- **Image Enhancement:** If the text is not clear, use browser tools to zoom in or enhance the image for better readability.\n\n### Concise Plan:\n- **Step 1:** Search for \"Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard archive 2022 site:web.archive.org\" using WebSurfer.\n- **Step 2:** Navigate to the archived page and find the section with the oldest flavor's headstone.\n- **Step 3:** Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and locate the headstone in the background.\n- **Step 4:** Zoom in or enhance the image to read the full text of the rhyme on the background headstone.\n- **Step 5:** Extract and provide the last line of the rhyme."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on a headstone.\n   - The headstone is visible in the background of a photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - The photo is from the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The information is as of the end of 2022.\n   - The Ben & Jerry's official website is currently experiencing issues and is not accessible directly.\n   - Searches for the archived page using specific queries on Bing have not yielded any results.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The identity of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n   - The specific photo of the oldest flavor's headstone that includes another headstone in the background.\n   - The full text of the rhyme on the headstone visible in the background, particularly the last line.\n\n   **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n   - Archived versions of the Ben & Jerry's official website, specifically the \"Flavor Graveyard\" section, using the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org).\n   - Official Ben & Jerry's social media accounts or press releases from 2022.\n   - Archival images or articles about the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard from 2022.\n   - News articles or blog posts that discuss the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact location of the headstone in the background within the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - The legibility and clarity of the text on the headstone in the background.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The oldest flavor's headstone is likely one of the earliest flavors retired by Ben & Jerry's, such as \"Rainforest Crunch\" or \"Peanut Butter and Jelly.\"\n   - The headstone in the background might be a well-known or significant flavor that was also retired, possibly a flavor that was retired around the same time or has a notable history.\n   - The last line of the rhyme could be a play on words or a humorous reference typical of Ben & Jerry's brand, often involving puns or cultural references.\n   - Given the issues with accessing the official website and the lack of results from Bing, it is highly likely that the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) will be the most reliable source to find the required information.\n\n**REASONING FOR UPDATED GUESSES:**\n- **Oldest Flavor's Headstone:** Early flavors like \"Rainforest Crunch\" and \"Peanut Butter and Jelly\" were among the first to be retired and are likely candidates for being the oldest in the graveyard.\n- **Headstone in the Background:** Significant flavors that have a rich history or were retired around the same time as the oldest flavor are more likely to be featured prominently in the background.\n- **Last Line of the Rhyme:** Ben & Jerry's is known for its playful and humorous approach to naming and describing their flavors, so the last line of the rhyme is likely to be a clever pun or reference.\n- **Wayback Machine:** Since the official website is inaccessible and Bing searches are not yielding results, the Wayback Machine is the most reliable source for finding the archived version of the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Step 1:** Use the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) to search for the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard from the end of 2022.\n   - **Search Query:** \"Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard\" and select the closest date to the end of 2022.\n2. **Step 2:** Once the archived page is found, navigate to the section containing the oldest flavor's headstone.\n3. **Step 3:** Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and locate the headstone visible in the background.\n4. **Step 4:** Zoom in or enhance the image to read the full text of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n5. **Step 5:** Extract and provide the last line of the rhyme from the identified headstone.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges:\n- **Use the Wayback Machine:** The Wayback Machine is a reliable source for archived web pages.\n- **Specific Search Queries:** Use more specific search queries to avoid landing on unrelated pages.\n- **Verify Page Content:** Ensure that the page contains the Flavor Graveyard section and is from the end of 2022.\n- **Image Enhancement:** If the text is not clear, use browser tools to zoom in or enhance the image for better readability.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan and search for the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard using the Wayback Machine.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Ineffective Search Queries:** The search queries used on Bing did not yield the desired results, possibly due to the specific phrasing or the search engine's limitations.\n- **Lack of Direct Access:** The Ben & Jerry's official website is currently inaccessible, and alternative search methods did not lead to the archived page.\n- **Insufficient Use of Resources:** The Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) was not utilized effectively to find the archived version of the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard.\n\n### New Plan:\n- **Step 1:** Use the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) to find the archived version of the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard from the end of 2022.\n  - **Search Query:** \"Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard\" and select the closest date to December 2022.\n- **Step 2:** Once the archived page is found, navigate to the section containing the oldest flavor's headstone.\n- **Step 3:** Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and locate the headstone visible in the background.\n- **Step 4:** Zoom in or enhance the image to read the full text of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n- **Step 5:** Extract and provide the last line of the rhyme from the identified headstone.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges:\n- **Use the Wayback Machine:** The Wayback Machine is a reliable source for archived web pages. Navigate to web.archive.org and use the search bar to find the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard.\n- **Specific Date Selection:** Choose the closest date to the end of 2022 to ensure the information is as recent as possible.\n- **Verify Page Content:** Ensure that the page contains the Flavor Graveyard section and is from the end of 2022.\n- **Image Enhancement:** If the text is not clear, use browser tools to zoom in or enhance the image for better readability.\n- **Avoid Bing Search:** Directly use the Wayback Machine to avoid the limitations of Bing search.\n\n### Concise Plan:\n- **Step 1:** Go to web.archive.org and search for \"Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard.\"\n- **Step 2:** Select the closest date to December 2022.\n- **Step 3:** Navigate to the section containing the oldest flavor's headstone.\n- **Step 4:** Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and locate the headstone in the background.\n- **Step 5:** Zoom in or enhance the image to read the full text of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n- **Step 6:** Extract and provide the last line of the rhyme."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on a headstone.\n   - The headstone is visible in the background of a photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - The photo is from the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The information is as of the end of 2022.\n   - The Ben & Jerry's official website is currently experiencing issues and is not accessible directly.\n   - Searches for the archived page using specific queries on Bing have not yielded any results.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The identity of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n   - The specific photo of the oldest flavor's headstone that includes another headstone in the background.\n   - The full text of the rhyme on the headstone visible in the background, particularly the last line.\n\n   **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n   - Archived versions of the Ben & Jerry's official website, specifically the \"Flavor Graveyard\" section, using the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org).\n   - Official Ben & Jerry's social media accounts or press releases from 2022.\n   - Archival images or articles about the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard from 2022.\n   - News articles or blog posts that discuss the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact location of the headstone in the background within the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - The legibility and clarity of the text on the headstone in the background.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The oldest flavor's headstone is likely one of the earliest flavors retired by Ben & Jerry's, such as \"Rainforest Crunch\" or \"Peanut Butter and Jelly.\" These flavors were among the first to be retired and are strong candidates for being the oldest in the graveyard.\n   - The headstone in the background might be a well-known or significant flavor that was also retired, possibly a flavor that was retired around the same time or has a notable history. Flavors like \"Cherry Garcia\" or \"Phish Food\" are popular and could be featured prominently.\n   - The last line of the rhyme could be a play on words or a humorous reference typical of Ben & Jerry's brand, often involving puns or cultural references. For example, it might be something like \"Rest in peace, you tasty treat\" or \"Gone but not forgotten, you were oh so sweet.\"\n   - Given the issues with accessing the official website and the lack of results from Bing, it is highly likely that the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) will be the most reliable source to find the required information. However, we should also consider checking social media accounts and press releases from 2022 for additional context.\n\n**REASONING FOR UPDATED GUESSES:**\n- **Oldest Flavor's Headstone:** Early flavors like \"Rainforest Crunch\" and \"Peanut Butter and Jelly\" were among the first to be retired and are likely candidates for being the oldest in the graveyard. These flavors have a significant history with the brand.\n- **Headstone in the Background:** Significant flavors that have a rich history or were retired around the same time as the oldest flavor are more likely to be featured prominently in the background. Popular flavors like \"Cherry Garcia\" or \"Phish Food\" fit this description.\n- **Last Line of the Rhyme:** Ben & Jerry's is known for its playful and humorous approach to naming and describing their flavors, so the last line of the rhyme is likely to be a clever pun or reference. Examples like \"Rest in peace, you tasty treat\" or \"Gone but not forgotten, you were oh so sweet\" align with the brand's tone.\n- **Wayback Machine:** Since the official website is inaccessible and Bing searches are not yielding results, the Wayback Machine is the most reliable source for finding the archived version of the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard. However, supplementing this with social media and press releases can provide additional context.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Step 1:** Use the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) to search for the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard from the end of 2022.\n   - **Search Query:** \"Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard\" and select the closest date to the end of 2022.\n2. **Step 2:** Once the archived page is found, navigate to the section containing the oldest flavor's headstone.\n3. **Step 3:** Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and locate the headstone visible in the background.\n4. **Step 4:** Zoom in or enhance the image to read the full text of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n5. **Step 5:** Extract and provide the last line of the rhyme from the identified headstone.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges:\n- **Use the Wayback Machine:** The Wayback Machine is a reliable source for archived web pages.\n- **Specific Search Queries:** Use more specific search queries to avoid landing on unrelated pages.\n- **Verify Page Content:** Ensure that the page contains the Flavor Graveyard section and is from the end of 2022.\n- **Image Enhancement:** If the text is not clear, use browser tools to zoom in or enhance the image for better readability.\n- **Supplement with Social Media and Press Releases:** Check Ben & Jerry's social media accounts and press releases from 2022 for additional context and information.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan and search for the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard using the Wayback Machine. If you encounter any issues, try checking the social media accounts and press releases as well.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Ineffective Navigation:** Despite reaching the Wayback Machine, the navigation to the specific archived page of the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard was not successful. The selected dates did not lead to the correct page, and there was a redirect issue.\n- **Lack of Specificity in Date Selection:** The dates chosen were not close enough to the end of 2022, leading to outdated or redirected pages.\n- **Missed Alternative Sources:** While the focus was on the Wayback Machine, other potential sources like social media and press releases were not explored.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Step 1:** Go to the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) and search for \"Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard.\"\n   - **Hint:** Use the search bar to enter \"Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard\" and select the closest date to December 2022.\n2. **Step 2:** Once the archived page loads, verify that it is the correct page by checking for the Flavor Graveyard section.\n   - **Hint:** Ensure the page contains the Flavor Graveyard section and is from the end of 2022.\n3. **Step 3:** Navigate to the section containing the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - **Hint:** Look for the oldest flavor's headstone, which is likely to be one of the early retired flavors like \"Rainforest Crunch\" or \"Peanut Butter and Jelly.\"\n4. **Step 4:** Identify the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and locate the headstone visible in the background.\n   - **Hint:** Zoom in or enhance the image to read the full text of the rhyme on the headstone in the background.\n5. **Step 5:** Extract and provide the last line of the rhyme from the identified headstone.\n   - **Hint:** If the text is not clear, use browser tools to zoom in or enhance the image for better readability.\n6. **Step 6:** If the Wayback Machine does not yield the correct page, check Ben & Jerry's social media accounts and press releases from 2022.\n   - **Hint:** Search for posts or articles that discuss the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard and the oldest flavor's headstone.\n\n### Additional Hints:\n- **Use the Wayback Machine:** Focus on the closest date to December 2022 to ensure the information is as recent as possible.\n- **Verify Page Content:** Double-check that the page contains the Flavor Graveyard section and is from the end of 2022.\n- **Image Enhancement:** Use browser tools to zoom in or enhance the image for better readability.\n- **Supplement with Social Media and Press Releases:** If the Wayback Machine does not provide the needed information, explore Ben & Jerry's social media accounts and press releases from 2022 for additional context.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan and search for the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard using the Wayback Machine. If you encounter any issues, try checking the social media accounts and press releases as well."}

Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on a headstone.\n   - The headstone is visible in the background of a photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - The photo is from the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The information is as of the end of 2022.\n   - The Ben & Jerry's official website is currently experiencing issues and is not accessible directly.\n   - Searches for the archived page using specific queries on Bing have not yielded any results.\n   - The Wayback Machine has archives of Ben & Jerry's website, but the most recent captures before 2022 are from 2012, and they redirect to the main site.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The identity of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022.\n   - The specific photo of the oldest flavor's headstone that includes another headstone in the background.\n   - The full text of the rhyme on the headstone visible in the background, particularly the last line.\n\n   **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n   - Archived versions of the Ben & Jerry's official website, specifically the \"Flavor Graveyard\" section, using the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org). Focus on dates closer to 2022.\n   - Official Ben & Jerry's social media accounts or press releases from 2022.\n   - Archival images or articles about the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard from 2022.\n   - News articles or blog posts that discuss the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact location of the headstone in the background within the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone.\n   - The legibility and clarity of the text on the headstone in the background.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The oldest flavor's headstone is likely one of the earliest flavors retired by Ben & Jerry's, such as \"Rainforest Crunch\" or \"Peanut Butter and Jelly.\" These flavors were among the first to be retired and are strong candidates for being the oldest in the graveyard.\n   - The headstone in the background might be a well-known or significant flavor that was also retired, possibly a flavor that was retired around the same time or has a notable history. Flavors like \"Cherry Garcia\" or \"Phish Food\" are popular and could be featured prominently.\n   - The last line of the rhyme could be a play on words or a humorous reference typical of Ben & Jerry's brand, often involving puns or cultural references. For example, it might be something like \"Rest in peace, you tasty treat\" or \"Gone but not forgotten, you were oh so sweet.\"\n   - Given the issues with accessing the official website and the lack of results from Bing, it is highly likely that the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) will be the most reliable source to find the required information. However, we should also consider checking social media accounts and press releases from 2022 for additional context.\n\n**NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n   - **Alternative Sources:** Since the Wayback Machine captures before 2022 are not available, we should explore alternative sources more thoroughly. Ben & Jerry's social media accounts, particularly Instagram and Facebook, often feature detailed posts and images of the Flavor Graveyard. These platforms might have the specific photo we are looking for.\n   - **Community Forums and Blogs:** Community forums and blogs dedicated to ice cream enthusiasts or Ben & Jerry's fans might have discussions or user-generated content featuring the Flavor Graveyard, including the specific photo and the text on the headstones.\n   - **Press Releases and News Articles:** Press releases from Ben & Jerry's or news articles discussing the Flavor Graveyard might contain high-resolution images or detailed descriptions of the headstones, including the rhymes.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Step 1:** Use the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) to search for the Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard from the end of 2022.\n   - **Search Query:** \"Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard\" and select the closest date to the end of 2022.\n   - **Hint:** If the most recent captures are from 2012 and redirect, try searching for specific sections of the website, such as \"Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard\" or \"Ben & Jerry's retired flavors.\"\n\n2. **Step 2:** If the Wayback Machine does not provide the needed information, check Ben & Jerry's social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter) for posts from 2022 that feature the Flavor Graveyard.\n   - **Hint:** Look for posts with high-resolution images and detailed descriptions of the headstones.\n\n3. **Step 3:** Explore community forums and blogs dedicated to Ben & Jerry's or ice cream enthusiasts.\n   - **Hint:** Search for discussions or user-generated content that might include the specific photo and the text on the headstones.\n\n4. **Step 4:** Check Ben & Jerry's press releases and news articles from 2022 for any mentions or images of the Flavor Graveyard.\n   - **Hint:** Look for articles or press releases that discuss the retirement of flavors or the Flavor Graveyard itself.\n\n5. **Step 5:** Once the specific photo is found, identify the headstone in the background and extract the last line of the rhyme.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges:\n- **Use the Wayback Machine:** Focus on dates closer to 2022 and try specific sections of the website.\n- **Social Media and Community Forums:** These platforms often have user-generated content and detailed discussions that can provide the needed information.\n- **Press Releases and News Articles:** Official sources can provide high-resolution images and detailed descriptions.\n- **Image Enhancement:** If the text is not clear, use browser tools to zoom in or enhance the image for better readability.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan and start by checking the Wayback Machine again, focusing on dates closer to 2022. If you encounter any issues, move on to the social media accounts and other sources.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\n- **Ineffective Date Selection:** The dates selected in the Wayback Machine were too far back (2012 and earlier), and the most recent captures before 2022 were redirecting to the main site.\n- **Limited Scope of Searches:** The search was too narrowly focused on the Wayback Machine, and alternative sources like social media and community forums were not adequately explored.\n- **Lack of Detailed Verification:** The verification process did not include checking the specific sections of the archived pages to ensure they contained the Flavor Graveyard.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Step 1:** Use the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) to search for \"Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard\" and select the closest date to December 2022.\n   - **Hint:** If the most recent captures are from 2012 and redirect, try searching for specific sections of the website, such as \"Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard\" or \"Ben & Jerry's retired flavors.\"\n   - **Hint:** Use the search bar to enter \"Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard\" and select the closest date to December 2022, ensuring it is after 2012.\n\n2. **Step 2:** If the Wayback Machine does not provide the needed information, check Ben & Jerry's social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter) for posts from 2022 that feature the Flavor Graveyard.\n   - **Hint:** Look for posts with high-resolution images and detailed descriptions of the headstones.\n   - **Hint:** Use specific hashtags like #BenAndJerrys, #FlavorGraveyard, and #RetiredFlavors to find relevant posts.\n\n3. **Step 3:** Explore community forums and blogs dedicated to Ben & Jerry's or ice cream enthusiasts.\n   - **Hint:** Search for discussions or user-generated content that might include the specific photo and the text on the headstones.\n   - **Hint:** Use search engines to find forums and blogs, and look for threads or posts discussing the Flavor Graveyard.\n\n4. **Step 4:** Check Ben & Jerry's press releases and news articles from 2022 for any mentions or images of the Flavor Graveyard.\n   - **Hint:** Look for articles or press releases that discuss the retirement of flavors or the Flavor Graveyard itself.\n   - **Hint:** Use search engines to find press releases and news articles, and look for high-resolution images and detailed descriptions.\n\n5. **Step 5:** Once the specific photo is found, identify the headstone in the background and extract the last line of the rhyme.\n   - **Hint:** If the text is not clear, use browser tools to zoom in or enhance the image for better readability.\n   - **Hint:** Take a screenshot of the relevant section for reference.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges:\n- **Use the Wayback Machine:** Focus on dates closer to 2022 and try specific sections of the website.\n- **Social Media and Community Forums:** These platforms often have user-generated content and detailed discussions that can provide the needed information.\n- **Press Releases and News Articles:** Official sources can provide high-resolution images and detailed descriptions.\n- **Image Enhancement:** If the text is not clear, use browser tools to zoom in or enhance the image for better readability.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan and start by checking the Wayback Machine again, focusing on dates closer to 2022.
