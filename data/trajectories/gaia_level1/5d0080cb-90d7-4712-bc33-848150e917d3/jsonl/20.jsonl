In the 2010 film, Toothless is struck down during a dragon raid and loses his left tail-fin, leaving him trapped in a sunken area. This paper investigates the feasibility of Hiccup, a teenage boy, being able to supply enough fish to maintain the dragon's diet by catching and bringing fish to him. It was found that in the twelve days that Toothless was trapped, he would have required 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, which totalled 716 kg. Hiccup would have had to carry 828 fish weighing a total of 8592 kg over the twelve days, which is unrealistic since he struggles to lift a shield in combat.\n\n***Introduction***  \nThe *How to Train Your Dragon* franchise is loosely based on the popular book series by Cressida Cowell [1]. The events take place in Viking Scotland, in the small village of Berk which is repeatedly attacked by dragons. One of the deadliest dragon species is the Night Fury, which was previously unseen by any living person. It is described as the \"unholy offspring of lightning and death itself” due to its speed and camouflage abilities [2]. Toothless is the only known Night Fury, and is shown to be intelligent, curious, and loyal. \n\nToothless is in The Cove for a total of twelve days [5]. It is assumed that Hiccup visited once a day for the duration of Toothless’ stay.  \n\nOn the third day, Hiccup brings a sack of fish, and mentions that it contains Icelandic cod and salmon. There is also a pond in the clearing, and one scene shows Toothless hunting for fish. However, in this paper, it is assumed that Toothless relies solely on Hiccup for nutrition. During his time in The Cove, it is assumed that his diet consists of only salmon and \n\n**of 7**\n\n---\n\nVisible UI elements:  \n- **Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon's Diet?**\n- [an eye icon for view]  \n- [upward navigation arrow]  \n- [downward navigation arrow]  \n- [page indicator] **1 of 7**\n- **Automatic Zoom** [dropdown menu]\n- [download icon]\n- [printer icon]\n- [clipboard icon]\n- [bookmark icon]\n- [additional options icon]\n<Image>"}

FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific volume of the fish bag in cubic meters (m^3) as calculated in the University of Leicester paper.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- None identified at this point.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The specific volume of the fish bag is likely discussed in the sections that outline the amount of fish Hiccup supplies and any assumptions made regarding the storage or transportation of the fish. Given that the abstract mentions the total weight of fish, it is plausible that the volume calculation might be found in a detailed analysis of the storage capacity Hiccup would need. Reasoning: It is common in scientific papers that detailed mathematical or physical calculations, such as volume, follow the general summary of quantities like weight.\n\nNext steps: Examine the downloaded PDF for sections that discuss the storage capacity or transportation logistics to find the specific volume of the fish bag in m^3.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n**Root Cause of Failure:**\nThe main issue in the previous attempts was the inability to locate the specific volume of the fish bag in the downloaded PDF file. Additionally, there were challenges with accessing and successfully downloading the file.\n\n**New Plan:**\n\n1. **WebSurfer:**\n   - Ensure the paper is fully downloaded and accessible.\n   - Verify the correct and complete download of the document on the local path.\n\n2. **FileSurfer:**\n   - Open the locally downloaded PDF.\n   - Search within the PDF document using keywords such as \"volume of fish bag\", \"cubic meters\", \"m^3\", \"storage capacity\", \"fish bag\", etc.\n\n3. **FileSurfer:**\n   - Extract the relevant portion of the text that mentions the volume of the fish bag.\n\n4. **Assistant:**\n   - Summarize the extracted information and provide the volume in cubic meters (m^3). If the exact phrase is not found, hypothesize the calculated volume based on the surrounding context and information available (e.g., dimensions given in the text).\n\nThis plan aims to retrieve and confirm the accuracy of the downloaded PDF file and quickly locate and extract the specific volume information within the document. It avoids repeating the web search process and directly ensures the correct file handling and extraction."}

In the 2010 film, Toothless is struck down during a dragon raid and loses his left tail-fin, leaving him trapped in a sunken area. This paper investigates the feasibility of Hiccup, a teenage boy, being able to supply enough fish to maintain the dragon’s diet by catching and bringing fish to him. It was found that in the twelve days that Toothless was trapped, he would have required 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, which totalled 716 kg. Hiccup would have had to carry 828 fish weighing a total of 8592 kg over the twelve days, which is unrealistic since he struggles to lift a shield in combat.\n\nIntroduction\nThe How to Train Your Dragon franchise is loosely based on the popular book series by Cressida Cowell [1]. The events take place in Viking Scotland, in the small village of Berk which is repeatedly attacked by dragons. One of the deadliest dragon species is the Night Fury, which was previously unseen by any living person. It is described as the “unholy offspring of lightning and death itself” due to its speed and camouflage abilities [2]. Toothless is the only known Night Fury, and is shown to be intelligent and emotional.\n\nToothless is in The Cove for a total of twelve days [5]. It is assumed that Hiccup visited once a day for the duration of Toothless' stay.\n\nOn the third day, Hiccup brings a sack of fish, and mentions that it contains Icelandic cod and salmon. There is also a pond in the clearing, and one scene shows Toothless hunting for fish. However, in this paper, it is assumed that Toothless relies solely on Hiccup for nutrition. During his time in The Cove, it is assumed that his diet consists of only salmon and cod.\n\nAutomatic Zoom\n\nDownload\n<Image>"}
