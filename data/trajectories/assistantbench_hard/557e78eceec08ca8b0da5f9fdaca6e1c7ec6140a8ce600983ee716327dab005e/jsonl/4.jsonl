Information on the wheelchair accessibility of these bars.\n   - The exact addresses of the nearby bars.\n   - Sources: Google Maps, Yelp, the official Mummers Museum website, and local disability resources or city directories.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The distance between the Mummers Museum and each nearby bar.\n   - The determination of which bar is the closest based on the distances calculated.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Mummers Museum is likely located in an area with several bars, given its location in Philadelphia, a city known for its vibrant nightlife.\n   - Some bars in urban areas are more likely to be wheelchair accessible due to building codes and regulations, but verification will be necessary.\n   - Based on the search results, some of the bars near the Mummers Museum include:\n     - **12 Steps Down** (831 Christian St, Philadelphia, PA 19147)\n     - **Milkboy Coffee** (1100 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19107)\n     - **The Twisted Tail** (509 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147)\n     - **The Pub on Passyunk East** (1515 E Passyunk Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19145)\n     - **JJ Bootleggers** (1334 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147)\n     - **Sassafras** (1324 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147)\n   - Among these bars, **The Twisted Tail** and **12 Steps Down** are particularly close to the Mummers Museum, and both are on South 2nd Street, which suggests they might be within walking distance.\n\n5. **NEXT STEPS**\n   - Verify the wheelchair accessibility of each bar listed above.\n   - Use Google Maps to measure the exact distances from the Mummers Museum to each bar.\n   - Identify the closest bar that is wheelchair accessible.\n\nBy focusing on these next steps, we should be able to determine the closest wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n\n1. **Overly Complex Search Queries**: The search queries were too complex and included multiple requests in a single query, which made it difficult to extract specific information.\n2. **Lack of Specificity**: The search results did not provide clear and direct answers to the wheelchair accessibility of the bars or their exact distances from the Mummers Museum.\n3. **Repetition of Searches**: The same search queries were repeated multiple times without significant changes, leading to redundant and unproductive efforts.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Break Down the Search into Smaller, More Focused Queries**:\n   - **Step 1**: Search for the wheelchair accessibility of each bar individually.\n   - **Step 2**: Use Google Maps to measure the distance from the Mummers Museum to each bar.\n\n2. **Use Specific and Direct Queries**:\n   - For wheelchair accessibility, use queries like \"Milkboy Coffee Philadelphia wheelchair accessible\" for each bar.\n   - For distances, use Google Maps directly to measure the distance from 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147 to each bar.\n\n3. **Verify and Record Information**:\n   - **Step 1**: Verify the wheelchair accessibility of each bar and record the results.\n   - **Step 2**: Measure and record the distance from the Mummers Museum to each bar.\n\n4. **Summarize and Determine the Closest Accessible Bar**:\n   - **Step 1**: Compile the information on accessibility and distances.\n   - **Step 2**: Identify the closest bar that is wheelchair accessible.\n\n### Detailed Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Check Wheelchair Accessibility**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Milkboy Coffee Philadelphia wheelchair accessible\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"The Twisted Tail Philadelphia wheelchair accessible\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"The Pub on Passyunk East Philadelphia wheelchair accessible\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"JJ Bootleggers Philadelphia wheelchair accessible\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Sassafras Philadelphia wheelchair accessible\".\n\n- **Step 2: Measure Distances Using Google Maps**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open Google Maps and measure the distance from 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147 to Milkboy Coffee.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Measure the distance from 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147 to The Twisted Tail.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Measure the distance from 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147 to The Pub on Passyunk East.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Measure the distance from 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147 to JJ Bootleggers.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Measure the distance from 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147 to Sassafras.\n\n- **Step 3: Compile and Analyze Results**\n  - **Assistant**: Record the wheelchair accessibility and distance for each bar.\n  - **Assistant**: Identify the closest bar that is wheelchair accessible and compile the final answer.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Focus on One Bar at a Time**: This will make the search more manageable and ensure that each piece of information is accurate.\n- **Use Google Maps Directly**: For distance measurements, use the built-in tools in Google Maps to get precise distances.\n- **Verify Information from Multiple Sources**: If possible, cross-check the wheelchair accessibility information from the bar's website, Google reviews, and local disability resources."}
