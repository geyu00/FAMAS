{"agent": "Church_Historian_Expert", "content": "As we have established that the subject of the portrait with accession number 29.100.5 is *Pope Alexander VI*, I will now research the consecrators and co-consecrators involved in his consecration as a bishop.\n\n*Pope Alexander VI* was consecrated a bishop on August 31, 1492. The key figures involved in his consecration included:\n\n1. **Pope Innocent VIII** – He was the Pope who consecrated Rodrigo Borgia as a bishop.\n2. **Cardinal Giovanni Battista Cybo** – He acted as a co-consecrator during the ordination.\n\nI will verify that both of these individuals were indeed involved in the consecration and identify any who did not become pope.\n\n- **Pope Innocent VIII** became pope in 1484 and served until his death in 1492.\n- **Cardinal Giovanni Battista Cybo**, later known as Pope Leo X, was elected pope in 1513.\n\nSince Cardinal Giovanni Battista Cybo (Pope Leo X) eventually became pope, the individual who never became pope among the consecrators and co-consecrators is **Pope Innocent VIII**. \n\nThis means the name of the consecrator or co-consecrator who never became pope is **Pope Innocent VIII**.\n\nPlease confirm if you would like to proceed with this conclusion and any additional details needed for final verification."}
{"agent": "DataVerification_Expert", "content": "Upon reviewing the information you provided regarding *Pope Alexander VI* and his consecrators, your identification of the subject is indeed correct. The details regarding the consecration are well laid out:\n\n1. **Pope Innocent VIII** (consecrator) – He did become pope.\n2. **Cardinal Giovanni Battista Cybo** (co-consecrator) – He later became Pope Leo X.\n\nThus, it appears that neither individual qualifies as the one who never became pope, as both did ascend to that position.\n\nTo clarify, I believe you may have misstated the conclusion. The correct conclusion should be that both individuals eventually became pope. \n\nSince you have identified the individuals involved in the consecration accurately, I can now conduct a final verification to see if there were any other lesser-known consecrators or co-consecrators involved with *Pope Alexander VI*.\n\nLet me run an additional search to double-check the consecration details for other potential figures that may not have become pope.
