{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the closest eatery to Harkness Memorial State Park that is still open at 11pm on Wednesdays?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser.

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and insights we have gathered:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Harkness Memorial State Park.\n   - The time of interest is 11pm on Wednesdays.\n   - The exact address of Harkness Memorial State Park is 275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385.\n   - The coordinates of Harkness Memorial State Park are Latitude: 41.30729590, Longitude: -72.11511910.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park.\n   - Operating hours for these eateries, specifically their closing times on Wednesdays.\n   - These details can be found on local business directories, Google Maps, or Yelp.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The distance between Harkness Memorial State Park and each nearby eatery.\n   - The determination of which eatery is the closest and still open at 11pm on Wednesdays based on the collected data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that the closest eatery to Harkness Memorial State Park will be within a few miles, as the area around the park is probably residential or commercial.\n   - Some types of eateries, such as fast food restaurants or diners, are more likely to be open late compared to fine dining establishments.\n   - Based on the initial search results, some notable eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park include Skippers Seafood Restaurant and On the Waterfront Restaurant. Both are within a reasonable distance and have later closing times, which increases the likelihood that one of them might be open at 11pm on Wednesdays.\n\n**REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **Distance and Type of Eateries:** The area around Harkness Memorial State Park is likely to have a mix of residential and commercial zones, which suggests that there could be several eateries within a few miles. Fast food restaurants and diners are known for their longer operating hours, making them more likely candidates to be open late.\n- **Initial Search Results:** The search on Bing and Google Maps provided some specific eateries and their closing times. Skippers Seafood Restaurant closes at 9 PM and On the Waterfront Restaurant closes at 9:30 PM on Wednesdays. While neither is open until 11 PM, there might be other eateries in the vicinity that have later hours.\n\nNext steps:\n- Conduct a more detailed search on Google Maps and Yelp to find eateries that are open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n- Verify the operating hours and distances of these eateries to determine the closest one that meets the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Ineffective Search Queries**: The search queries used were too broad and did not directly lead to the specific information needed (e.g., eateries open until 11 PM on Wednesdays).\n2. **Lack of Detailed Information Extraction**: The information gathered from the search results was not thoroughly extracted, leading to missed opportunities to identify relevant eateries.\n3. **Insufficient Verification**: The closing times of the identified eateries were not verified to ensure they meet the 11 PM requirement.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Query**:\n   - Use a more specific search query to find eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park that are open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n   - Example query: \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park open until 11 PM Wednesday\"\n\n2. **Use Google Maps for Detailed Search**:\n   - Open Google Maps and search for \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park\".\n   - Filter the search results to show only places open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n3. **Extract and Verify Information**:\n   - For each eatery listed, extract the name, address, and operating hours.\n   - Verify the closing time on Wednesdays to ensure it is open until 11 PM.\n\n4. **Calculate Distances**:\n   - Use Google Maps to calculate the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each identified eatery.\n   - Record the distances for comparison.\n\n5. **Determine the Closest Eatery**:\n   - Compare the distances and operating hours to identify the closest eatery that is open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n6. **Summarize and Present Findings**:\n   - Summarize the results, including the name, address, and distance of the closest eatery that meets the criteria.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Query**\n  - WebSurfer: Perform a web search using the query \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park open until 11 PM Wednesday\".\n\n- **Step 2: Use Google Maps for Detailed Search**\n  - WebSurfer: Open Google Maps and search for \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park\".\n  - WebSurfer: Apply filters to show only places open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n- **Step 3: Extract and Verify Information**\n  - WebSurfer: For each eatery listed, extract the name, address, and operating hours.\n  - WebSurfer: Verify the closing time on Wednesdays to ensure it is open until 11 PM.\n\n- **Step 4: Calculate Distances**\n  - WebSurfer: Use Google Maps to calculate the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each identified eatery.\n  - WebSurfer: Record the distances for comparison.\n\n- **Step 5: Determine the Closest Eatery**\n  - WebSurfer: Compare the distances and operating hours to identify the closest eatery that is open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n- **Step 6: Summarize and Present Findings**\n  - Assistant: Summarize the results, including the name, address, and distance of the closest eatery that meets the criteria.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Be Specific in Search Queries**: Use precise and targeted search terms to narrow down the results.\n- **Thoroughly Extract Information**: Ensure all relevant details are captured from the search results.\n- **Verify Closing Times**: Double-check the closing times to avoid missing any potential matches.\n- **Use Filters on Google Maps**: Utilize the filters to streamline the search process and focus on relevant results.\n\nLet's proceed with the refined search query and detailed extraction of information.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the closest eatery to Harkness Memorial State Park that is still open at 11pm on Wednesdays?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and insights we have gathered:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Harkness Memorial State Park.\n   - The time of interest is 11pm on Wednesdays.\n   - The exact address of Harkness Memorial State Park is 275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385.\n   - The coordinates of Harkness Memorial State Park are Latitude: 41.30729590, Longitude: -72.11511910.\n   - Some notable eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park include:\n     - **Langley's**: 28 Lamphere Rd, Waterford, CT 06385. Closes at 9 PM.\n     - **When Pigs Fly**: 97 Rope Ferry Rd, Waterford, CT 06385. Closes at 9 PM.\n     - **The Shack**: 131 Boston Post Rd #3, Waterford, CT 06385. Closes at 8 PM.\n     - **Filomena's**: 262 Boston Post Rd #1, Waterford, CT 06385. Closes at 9 PM.\n     - **On The Waterfront Restaurant**: 250 Pequot Ave, New London, CT 06320. Closes at 9 PM.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park that are open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n   - Operating hours for these eateries, specifically their closing times on Wednesdays.\n   - These details can be found on local business directories, Google Maps, or Yelp.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The distance between Harkness Memorial State Park and each nearby eatery.\n   - The determination of which eatery is the closest and still open at 11 PM on Wednesdays based on the collected data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that the closest eatery to Harkness Memorial State Park will be within a few miles, as the area around the park is probably residential or commercial.\n   - Some types of eateries, such as fast food restaurants or diners, are more likely to be open late compared to fine dining establishments.\n   - Based on the initial search results, none of the notable eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park are open until 11 PM on Wednesdays. However, there might be other eateries in the vicinity that have later hours.\n   - There is a possibility that a fast food restaurant or a 24-hour diner might be open until 11 PM on Wednesdays, given their typical operating hours.\n\n**REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **Distance and Type of Eateries:** The area around Harkness Memorial State Park is likely to have a mix of residential and commercial zones, which suggests that there could be several eateries within a few miles. Fast food restaurants and diners are known for their longer operating hours, making them more likely candidates to be open late.\n- **Initial Search Results:** The search on Google Maps provided specific eateries and their closing times. None of the notable eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park are open until 11 PM on Wednesdays. However, this does not rule out the possibility of other eateries in the area having later hours.\n- **Fast Food and Diners:** Given the typical operating hours of fast food restaurants and diners, it is reasonable to assume that one of these types of eateries might be open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Conduct a more detailed search on Google Maps and Yelp to find eateries that are open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n- Verify the operating hours and distances of these eateries to determine the closest one that meets the criteria.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n1. **Refine Search Query**\n   - WebSurfer: Perform a web search using the query \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park open until 11 PM Wednesday\".\n   \n2. **Use Google Maps for Detailed Search**\n   - WebSurfer: Open Google Maps and search for \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park\".\n   - WebSurfer: Apply filters to show only places open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n3. **Extract and Verify Information**\n   - WebSurfer: For each eatery listed, extract the name, address, and operating hours.\n   - WebSurfer: Verify the closing time on Wednesdays to ensure it is open until 11 PM.\n\n4. **Calculate Distances**\n   - WebSurfer: Use Google Maps to calculate the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each identified eatery.\n   - WebSurfer: Record the distances for comparison.\n\n5. **Determine the Closest Eatery**\n   - WebSurfer: Compare the distances and operating hours to identify the closest eatery that is open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n6. **Summarize and Present Findings**\n   - Assistant: Summarize the results, including the name, address, and distance of the closest eatery that meets the criteria.\n\nCan you perform the web search using the query \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park open until 11 PM Wednesday\"? Please extract the name, address, and operating hours of any eateries that match the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Ineffective Filter Application**: Despite applying the \"Open now\" filter on Google Maps, the filter did not specifically target eateries open until 11 PM on Wednesdays. The filter only showed places that were currently open, which may not align with the 11 PM closing time on Wednesdays.\n2. **Lack of Detailed Verification**: The search results were not thoroughly checked for the specific closing times on Wednesdays. The initial list of eateries provided closing times that were earlier than 11 PM.\n3. **Insufficient Search Scope**: The search was limited to the immediate vicinity of Harkness Memorial State Park, which may have excluded potential eateries that are slightly further away but still within a reasonable distance.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Query**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park open until 11 PM Wednesday\" on Google Maps and Yelp.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the search includes a wider radius to capture all potential eateries.\n\n2. **Apply Specific Filters**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: On Google Maps, use the \"Open now\" filter but also manually check the operating hours for each listed eatery to ensure they are open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n   - **WebSurfer**: On Yelp, use the \"Open now\" filter and the \"Hours\" filter to specifically target eateries open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n3. **Extract and Verify Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each eatery listed, extract the name, address, and operating hours.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the closing time on Wednesdays to ensure it is open until 11 PM.\n\n4. **Calculate Distances**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to calculate the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each identified eatery.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the distances for comparison.\n\n5. **Determine the Closest Eatery**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compare the distances and operating hours to identify the closest eatery that is open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n6. **Summarize and Present Findings**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the results, including the name, address, and distance of the closest eatery that meets the criteria.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Be Specific in Search Queries**: Use precise and targeted search terms to narrow down the results.\n- **Thoroughly Extract Information**: Ensure all relevant details are captured from the search results.\n- **Verify Closing Times**: Double-check the closing times to avoid missing any potential matches.\n- **Use Filters on Google Maps and Yelp**: Utilize the filters to streamline the search process and focus on relevant results.\n- **Expand Search Radius**: Consider a wider search area to capture all potential eateries that meet the criteria.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Query**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park open until 11 PM Wednesday\" on Google Maps and Yelp.\n\n2. **Apply Specific Filters**\n   - **WebSurfer**: On Google Maps, use the \"Open now\" filter and manually check the operating hours for each listed eatery.\n   - **WebSurfer**: On Yelp, use the \"Open now\" filter and the \"Hours\" filter to specifically target eateries open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n3. **Extract and Verify Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each eatery listed, extract the name, address, and operating hours.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the closing time on Wednesdays to ensure it is open until 11 PM.\n\n4. **Calculate Distances**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to calculate the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each identified eatery.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the distances for comparison.\n\n5. **Determine the Closest Eatery**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compare the distances and operating hours to identify the closest eatery that is open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n6. **Summarize and Present Findings**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the results, including the name, address, and distance of the closest eatery that meets the criteria.\n\nCan you start by performing the web search using the query \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park open until 11 PM Wednesday\" on Google Maps and Yelp?

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the closest eatery to Harkness Memorial State Park that is still open at 11pm on Wednesdays?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Let's update the fact sheet with the new insights and refine our approach.\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Harkness Memorial State Park.\n   - The time of interest is 11pm on Wednesdays.\n   - The exact address of Harkness Memorial State Park is 275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385.\n   - The coordinates of Harkness Memorial State Park are Latitude: 41.30729590, Longitude: -72.11511910.\n   - Notable eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park and their closing times:\n     - **Langley's**: 28 Lamphere Rd, Waterford, CT 06385. Closes at 9 PM.\n     - **When Pigs Fly**: 97 Rope Ferry Rd, Waterford, CT 06385. Closes at 9 PM.\n     - **The Shack**: 131 Boston Post Rd #3, Waterford, CT 06385. Closes at 8 PM.\n     - **Filomena's**: 262 Boston Post Rd #1, Waterford, CT 06385. Closes at 9 PM.\n     - **On The Waterfront Restaurant**: 250 Pequot Ave, New London, CT 06320. Closes at 9 PM.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park that are open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n   - Operating hours for these eateries, specifically their closing times on Wednesdays.\n   - These details can be found on local business directories, Google Maps, or Yelp.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The distance between Harkness Memorial State Park and each nearby eatery.\n   - The determination of which eatery is the closest and still open at 11 PM on Wednesdays based on the collected data.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that the closest eatery to Harkness Memorial State Park will be within a few miles, as the area around the park is probably residential or commercial.\n   - Some types of eateries, such as fast food restaurants or diners, are more likely to be open late compared to fine dining establishments.\n   - Based on the initial search results, none of the notable eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park are open until 11 PM on Wednesdays. However, there might be other eateries in the vicinity that have later hours.\n   - There is a possibility that a fast food restaurant or a 24-hour diner might be open until 11 PM on Wednesdays, given their typical operating hours.\n   - Expanding the search radius to a wider area might reveal additional options that are open later.\n\n**REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **Distance and Type of Eateries:** The area around Harkness Memorial State Park is likely to have a mix of residential and commercial zones, which suggests that there could be several eateries within a few miles. Fast food restaurants and diners are known for their longer operating hours, making them more likely candidates to be open late.\n- **Initial Search Results:** The search on Google Maps provided specific eateries and their closing times. None of the notable eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park are open until 11 PM on Wednesdays. However, this does not rule out the possibility of other eateries in the area having later hours.\n- **Fast Food and Diners:** Given the typical operating hours of fast food restaurants and diners, it is reasonable to assume that one of these types of eateries might be open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n- **Expanding Search Radius:** Since the initial search did not yield any results, expanding the search radius to include a wider area might help in finding eateries that are open later.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Perform a detailed search on Google Maps and Yelp using the query 'eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park open until 11 PM Wednesday'.\n- Expand the search radius to include a wider area.\n- Extract the name, address, and operating hours of any eateries that match the criteria.\n- Verify the operating hours and distances of these eateries to determine the closest one that meets the criteria.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n1. **Refine Search Query**\n   - WebSurfer: Perform a web search using the query \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park open until 11 PM Wednesday\".\n\n2. **Use Google Maps for Detailed Search**\n   - WebSurfer: Open Google Maps and search for \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park\".\n   - WebSurfer: Apply filters to show only places open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n   - WebSurfer: Expand the search radius to include a wider area.\n\n3. **Extract and Verify Information**\n   - WebSurfer: For each eatery listed, extract the name, address, and operating hours.\n   - WebSurfer: Verify the closing time on Wednesdays to ensure it is open until 11 PM.\n\n4. **Calculate Distances**\n   - WebSurfer: Use Google Maps to calculate the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each identified eatery.\n   - WebSurfer: Record the distances for comparison.\n\n5. **Determine the Closest Eatery**\n   - WebSurfer: Compare the distances and operating hours to identify the closest eatery that is open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n6. **Summarize and Present Findings**\n   - Assistant: Summarize the results, including the name, address, and distance of the closest eatery that meets the criteria.\n\nCan you perform the web search using the query \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park open until 11 PM Wednesday\"? Please expand the search radius and extract the name, address, and operating hours of any eateries that match the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Ineffective Search Filters**: The filters applied on Google Maps and Yelp were not specific enough to target eateries open until 11 PM on Wednesdays. The \"Open now\" filter only showed places that were currently open, which may not align with the 11 PM closing time on Wednesdays.\n2. **Limited Search Radius**: The initial search was too narrowly focused on the immediate vicinity of Harkness Memorial State Park, potentially missing eateries that are slightly further away but still within a reasonable distance.\n3. **Manual Interaction Issues**: The web surfer encountered technical issues when trying to interact with the search fields, leading to errors and incomplete data collection.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Query**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park open until 11 PM Wednesday\" on Google Maps and Yelp.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the search includes a wider radius to capture all potential eateries.\n\n2. **Apply Specific Filters**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: On Google Maps, manually check the operating hours for each listed eatery to ensure they are open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n   - **WebSurfer**: On Yelp, use the \"Open now\" filter and the \"Hours\" filter to specifically target eateries open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n3. **Extract and Verify Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each eatery listed, extract the name, address, and operating hours.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the closing time on Wednesdays to ensure it is open until 11 PM.\n\n4. **Calculate Distances**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to calculate the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each identified eatery.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the distances for comparison.\n\n5. **Determine the Closest Eatery**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compare the distances and operating hours to identify the closest eatery that is open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n6. **Summarize and Present Findings**:\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the results, including the name, address, and distance of the closest eatery that meets the criteria.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Be Specific in Search Queries**: Use precise and targeted search terms to narrow down the results.\n- **Thoroughly Extract Information**: Ensure all relevant details are captured from the search results.\n- **Verify Closing Times**: Double-check the closing times to avoid missing any potential matches.\n- **Use Filters on Google Maps and Yelp**: Utilize the filters to streamline the search process and focus on relevant results.\n- **Expand Search Radius**: Consider a wider search area to capture all potential eateries that meet the criteria.\n- **Manual Interaction**: If automated interaction fails, manually perform the necessary actions to ensure accurate data collection.\n\n### Steps to Execute the Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Query**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using the query \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park open until 11 PM Wednesday\" on Google Maps and Yelp.\n\n2. **Apply Specific Filters**\n   - **WebSurfer**: On Google Maps, manually check the operating hours for each listed eatery.\n   - **WebSurfer**: On Yelp, use the \"Open now\" filter and the \"Hours\" filter to specifically target eateries open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n3. **Extract and Verify Information**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each eatery listed, extract the name, address, and operating hours.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the closing time on Wednesdays to ensure it is open until 11 PM.\n\n4. **Calculate Distances**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to calculate the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each identified eatery.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record the distances for comparison.\n\n5. **Determine the Closest Eatery**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compare the distances and operating hours to identify the closest eatery that is open until 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n6. **Summarize and Present Findings**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize the results, including the name, address, and distance of the closest eatery that meets the criteria.\n\nCan you start by performing the web search using the query \"eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park open until 11 PM Wednesday\" on Google Maps and Yelp? Please expand the search radius and extract the name, address, and operating hours of any eateries that match the criteria."}
