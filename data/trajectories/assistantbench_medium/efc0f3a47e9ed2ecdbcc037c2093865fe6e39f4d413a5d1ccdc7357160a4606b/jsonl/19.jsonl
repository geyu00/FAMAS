{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period for comparison is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds.\n   - The transaction fees for each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each qualifying fund at the beginning (May 2019) and end (May 2024) of the specified period.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or through Fidelity's customer service.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each qualifying fund over the specified period, calculated using the formula: \\(\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{End Value} - \\text{Start Value}}{\\text{Start Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that Fidelity offers multiple international emerging markets equity funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The market performance of emerging markets can be volatile, so some funds may have experienced significant fluctuations during the given period.\n   - Given the volatility, it is possible that one or more funds may have shown a low or even negative percentage increase.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find the list of Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit Fidelity's official website to gather detailed information about these funds, including their transaction fees.\n\n- **Step 2: Filter Funds with $0 Transaction Fees**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Extract the list of funds that have $0 transaction fees.\n\n- **Step 3: Collect Historical Data**\n  - **WebSurfer**: For each qualifying fund, collect the net asset value (NAV) or share price data for May 2019 and May 2024.\n  - **WebSurfer**: If the data is not directly available, look for historical performance charts or tables that can provide the necessary values.\n\n- **Step 4: Calculate Percentage Increase**\n  - **Assistant**: Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each qualifying fund over the specified period.\n  - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the provided Python script to perform the calculations.\n\n- **Step 5: Identify the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase**\n  - **Assistant**: Analyze the results to determine which fund had the lowest percentage increase.\n  - **Assistant**: Prepare a summary of the findings, including the name of the fund and the percentage increase.\n\n- **Step 6: Verify and Report**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Double-check the identified fund's data for accuracy.\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the final report and present the findings."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and any new insights:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period for comparison is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds.\n   - The transaction fees for each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each qualifying fund at the beginning (May 2019) and end (May 2024) of the specified period.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or through Fidelity's customer service.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each qualifying fund over the specified period, calculated using the formula: \\(\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{End Value} - \\text{Start Value}}{\\text{Start Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that Fidelity offers multiple international emerging markets equity funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The market performance of emerging markets can be volatile, so some funds may have experienced significant fluctuations during the given period.\n   - Given the volatility, it is possible that one or more funds may have shown a low or even negative percentage increase.\n   - **New Guess**: The Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) is a prominent Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Fund and might be one of the funds with $0 transaction fees. This guess is based on the prominence of FEMKX in previous search results and its frequent mention in financial news and data providers.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- **Challenges**: We encountered issues accessing the Fidelity and Morningstar websites due to network errors and CAPTCHA verification. This suggests that we may need to use alternative methods or data sources to gather the required information.\n- **Alternative Sources**: Consider using financial news websites like MarketWatch or Seeking Alpha, or financial data providers like Bloomberg, to gather the necessary data.\n- **Manual Verification**: If automated web surfing continues to face challenges, manually verifying the data from the official Fidelity website or contacting Fidelity's customer service might be necessary.\n\nBy incorporating these updates and new insights, we can better guide our next steps in solving the task.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Network Issues**: The WebSurfer encountered network errors (e.g., `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`) when trying to access the Fidelity and Morningstar websites.\n2. **CAPTCHA Verification**: The WebSurfer was unable to bypass CAPTCHA verification on the Morningstar website, which prevented access to the required data.\n3. **Incorrect Search Results**: The search on Yahoo Finance did not yield the expected results, possibly due to the search query being interpreted incorrectly or the website not providing the relevant information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Alternative Financial Websites**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds on MarketWatch (https://www.marketwatch.com/) and Seeking Alpha (https://seekingalpha.com/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the search query is precise: \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds\" and filter results to include only mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n\n2. **Manual Verification**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually verify the list of funds and their transaction fees from the official Fidelity website (https://www.fidelity.com/) by navigating through the site and avoiding CAPTCHA triggers.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If necessary, take screenshots of the relevant pages for reference.\n\n3. **Collect Historical Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each qualifying fund, collect the net asset value (NAV) or share price data for May 2019 and May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search functionality on the financial websites to find historical data or navigate to the fund's performance page.\n\n4. **Calculate Percentage Increase**:\n   - **Assistant**: Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each qualifying fund over the specified period.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the provided Python script to perform the calculations.\n\n5. **Identify the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase**:\n   - **Assistant**: Analyze the results to determine which fund had the lowest percentage increase.\n   - **Assistant**: Prepare a summary of the findings, including the name of the fund and the percentage increase.\n\n6. **Verify and Report**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Double-check the identified fund's data for accuracy.\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final report and present the findings.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Avoid CAPTCHA Triggers**: Navigate the official Fidelity website manually to avoid triggering CAPTCHA verification.\n- **Use Precise Search Queries**: Ensure search queries are specific and include keywords like \"mutual funds,\" \"transaction fees,\" and \"historical data.\"\n- **Multiple Sources**: Use multiple financial news and data websites to cross-verify information and ensure accuracy.\n- **Manual Verification**: Take screenshots of relevant pages to ensure data integrity and for reference.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Search for Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds on MarketWatch and Seeking Alpha.\n- **Step 2**: Manually verify the list of funds and their transaction fees from the official Fidelity website.\n- **Step 3**: Collect the net asset value (NAV) or share price data for May 2019 and May 2024 for each qualifying fund.\n- **Step 4**: Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each qualifying fund.\n- **Step 5**: Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n- **Step 6**: Verify the identified fund's data and compile the final report.\n\nBy following this plan, we can avoid the previous issues and successfully complete the task."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and any new insights:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period for comparison is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds.\n   - The transaction fees for each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each qualifying fund at the beginning (May 2019) and end (May 2024) of the specified period.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or through Fidelity's customer service.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each qualifying fund over the specified period, calculated using the formula: \\(\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{End Value} - \\text{Start Value}}{\\text{Start Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that Fidelity offers multiple international emerging markets equity funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The market performance of emerging markets can be volatile, so some funds may have experienced significant fluctuations during the given period.\n   - Given the volatility, it is possible that one or more funds may have shown a low or even negative percentage increase.\n   - **New Guess**: The Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) is a prominent Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Fund and might be one of the funds with $0 transaction fees. This guess is based on the prominence of FEMKX in previous search results and its frequent mention in financial news and data providers.\n   - **Updated Guess**: Since automated web surfing has been challenging due to CAPTCHA and network issues, manually navigating to the official Fidelity website and collecting the data directly might be the most reliable method. This approach can help avoid the technical hurdles we've encountered.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- **Challenges**: We have encountered issues accessing the Fidelity and Morningstar websites due to network errors and CAPTCHA verification. This suggests that we may need to use alternative methods or data sources to gather the required information.\n- **Alternative Sources**: Consider using financial news websites like MarketWatch or Seeking Alpha, or financial data providers like Bloomberg, to gather the necessary data.\n- **Manual Verification**: If automated web surfing continues to face challenges, manually verifying the data from the official Fidelity website or contacting Fidelity's customer service might be necessary.\n- **New Insight**: The official Fidelity website is a primary source for accurate and up-to-date information on mutual funds, including transaction fees and historical performance data. Manually navigating this site and taking screenshots for reference could be the most effective approach.\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n1. **Manually Navigate to Fidelity Website**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually navigate to the official Fidelity website (https://www.fidelity.com/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify any mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Collect the net asset value (NAV) or share price data for May 2019 and May 2024 for each qualifying fund.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Take screenshots of the relevant pages for reference.\n\n2. **Calculate Percentage Increase**:\n   - **Assistant**: Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each qualifying fund over the specified period.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the provided Python script to perform the calculations.\n\n3. **Identify the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase**:\n   - **Assistant**: Analyze the results to determine which fund had the lowest percentage increase.\n   - **Assistant**: Prepare a summary of the findings, including the name of the fund and the percentage increase.\n\n4. **Verify and Report**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Double-check the identified fund's data for accuracy.\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final report and present the findings.\n\nBy following this updated plan, we can avoid the previous issues and successfully complete the task.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Network Issues**: The WebSurfer encountered network errors (e.g., `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`) when trying to access the Fidelity website.\n2. **CAPTCHA Verification**: The WebSurfer was unable to bypass CAPTCHA verification on multiple financial websites (Fidelity, Morningstar, Bloomberg, and Investopedia).\n3. **Incorrect Search Results**: The search on Yahoo Finance did not yield the expected results, possibly due to the search query being interpreted incorrectly or the website not providing the relevant information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Manual Navigation and Data Collection**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually navigate to the official Fidelity website (https://www.fidelity.com/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds\" using the search bar.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Collect the net asset value (NAV) or share price data for May 2019 and May 2024 for each qualifying fund.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Take screenshots of the relevant pages for reference.\n\n2. **Use Financial News Websites**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds\" on MarketWatch (https://www.marketwatch.com/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Collect the net asset value (NAV) or share price data for May 2019 and May 2024 for each qualifying fund.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Take screenshots of the relevant pages for reference.\n\n3. **Cross-Verify Data**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-verify the data collected from the Fidelity website with data from MarketWatch.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure the data is consistent and accurate.\n\n4. **Calculate Percentage Increase**:\n   - **Assistant**: Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each qualifying fund over the specified period.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the provided Python script to perform the calculations.\n\n5. **Identify the Fund with the Lowest Percentage Increase**:\n   - **Assistant**: Analyze the results to determine which fund had the lowest percentage increase.\n   - **Assistant**: Prepare a summary of the findings, including the name of the fund and the percentage increase.\n\n6. **Verify and Report**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Double-check the identified fund's data for accuracy.\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the final report and present the findings.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Avoid CAPTCHA Triggers**: Navigate the official Fidelity website manually to avoid triggering CAPTCHA verification.\n- **Use Precise Search Queries**: Ensure search queries are specific and include keywords like \"mutual funds,\" \"transaction fees,\" and \"historical data.\"\n- **Multiple Sources**: Use multiple financial news and data websites to cross-verify information and ensure accuracy.\n- **Manual Verification**: Take screenshots of relevant pages to ensure data integrity and for reference.\n- **Wait for Pages to Load**: If necessary, use the `sleep` function to wait for pages to fully load before interacting with them.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Manually navigate to the official Fidelity website and search for Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds with $0 transaction fees.\n- **Step 2**: Collect the net asset value (NAV) or share price data for May 2019 and May 2024 for each qualifying fund.\n- **Step 3**: Search for the same information on MarketWatch and cross-verify the data.\n- **Step 4**: Use Python to calculate the percentage increase for each qualifying fund.\n- **Step 5**: Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n- **Step 6**: Verify the identified fund's data and compile the final report."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period for comparison is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds.\n   - The transaction fees for each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each qualifying fund at the beginning (May 2019) and end (May 2024) of the specified period.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or through Fidelity's customer service.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each qualifying fund over the specified period, calculated using the formula: \\(\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{End Value} - \\text{Start Value}}{\\text{Start Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that Fidelity offers multiple international emerging markets equity funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The market performance of emerging markets can be volatile, so some funds may have experienced significant fluctuations during the given period.\n   - Given the volatility, it is possible that one or more funds may have shown a low or even negative percentage increase.\n   - **New Guess**: The Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) is a prominent Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Fund and might be one of the funds with $0 transaction fees. This guess is based on the prominence of FEMKX in previous search results and its frequent mention in financial news and data providers.\n   - **Updated Guess**: Since automated web surfing has been challenging due to CAPTCHA and network issues, manually navigating to the official Fidelity website and collecting the data directly might be the most reliable method. This approach can help avoid the technical hurdles we've encountered.\n   - **Additional Guess**: Other potential Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds with $0 transaction fees might include Fidelity Emerging Markets Discovery Fund (FEMDX) and Fidelity Emerging Markets Income Fund (FEINX). These funds are also frequently mentioned in financial literature and might be worth checking.\n   - **New Insight**: Financial news websites like MarketWatch and Seeking Alpha often provide detailed information on mutual funds, including historical performance data. These sites can serve as secondary sources to cross-verify the data obtained from the Fidelity website.\n   - **New Insight**: Directly contacting Fidelity's customer service via phone or email might be a reliable way to obtain the necessary data, especially if web surfing continues to face challenges.\n   - **New Guess**: The Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) and Fidelity Emerging Markets Discovery Fund (FEMDX) are likely to be among the top candidates due to their prominence and availability in financial databases. This guess is based on their frequent mentions and the likelihood of having $0 transaction fees.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- **Challenges**: We have encountered issues accessing the Fidelity and Morningstar websites due to network errors and CAPTCHA verification. This suggests that we may need to use alternative methods or data sources to gather the required information.\n- **Alternative Sources**: Consider using financial news websites like MarketWatch or Seeking Alpha, or financial data providers like Bloomberg, to gather the necessary data.\n- **Manual Verification**: If automated web surfing continues to face challenges, manually verifying the data from the official Fidelity website or contacting Fidelity's customer service might be necessary.\n- **New Insight**: The official Fidelity website is a primary source for accurate and up-to-date information on mutual funds, including transaction fees and historical performance data. Manually navigating this site and taking screenshots for reference could be the most effective approach.\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n1. **Manually Navigate to Fidelity Website**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually navigate to the official Fidelity website (https://www.fidelity.com/).\n   -

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund must be a Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Fund.\n   - The mutual fund must have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The time period for comparison is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of all Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds.\n   - The transaction fees for each of these funds to confirm which ones have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The net asset value (NAV) or share price of each qualifying fund at the beginning (May 2019) and end (May 2024) of the specified period.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or through Fidelity's customer service.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each qualifying fund over the specified period, calculated using the formula: \\(\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{End Value} - \\text{Start Value}}{\\text{Start Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that Fidelity offers multiple international emerging markets equity funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The market performance of emerging markets can be volatile, so some funds may have experienced significant fluctuations during the given period.\n   - Given the volatility, it is possible that one or more funds may have shown a low or even negative percentage increase.\n   - **New Guess**: The Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) is a prominent Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Fund and might be one of the funds with $0 transaction fees. This guess is based on the prominence of FEMKX in previous search results and its frequent mention in financial news and data providers.\n   - **Updated Guess**: Since automated web surfing has been challenging due to CAPTCHA and network issues, manually navigating to the official Fidelity website and collecting the data directly might be the most reliable method. This approach can help avoid the technical hurdles we've encountered.\n   - **Additional Guess**: Other potential Fidelity International Emerging Markets Equity Funds with $0 transaction fees might include Fidelity Emerging Markets Discovery Fund (FEMDX) and Fidelity Emerging Markets Income Fund (FEINX). These funds are also frequently mentioned in financial literature and might be worth checking.\n   - **New Insight**: Financial news websites like MarketWatch and Seeking Alpha often provide detailed information on mutual funds, including historical performance data. These sites can serve as secondary sources to cross-verify the data obtained from the Fidelity website.\n   - **New Insight**: Directly contacting Fidelity's customer service via phone or email might be a reliable way to obtain the necessary data, especially if web surfing continues to face challenges.\n   - **New Guess**: The Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) and Fidelity Emerging Markets Discovery Fund (FEMDX) are likely to be among the top candidates due to their prominence and availability in financial databases. This guess is based on their frequent mentions and the likelihood of having $0 transaction fees.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- **Challenges**: We have encountered issues accessing the Fidelity and Morningstar websites due to network errors and CAPTCHA verification. This suggests that we may need to use alternative methods or data sources to gather the required information.\n- **Alternative Sources**: Consider using financial news websites like MarketWatch or Seeking Alpha, or financial data providers like Bloomberg, to gather the necessary data.\n- **Manual Verification**: If automated web surfing continues to face challenges, manually verifying the data from the official Fidelity website or contacting Fidelity's customer service might be necessary.\n- **New Insight**: The official Fidelity website is a primary source for accurate and up-to-date information on mutual funds, including transaction fees and historical performance data. Manually navigating this site and taking screenshots for reference could be the most effective approach.\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n1. **Manually Navigate to Fidelity Website**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually navigate to the official Fidelity website (https://www.fidelity.com/).\n   -
