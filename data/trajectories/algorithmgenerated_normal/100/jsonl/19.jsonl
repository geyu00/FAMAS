The movie expert will identify all the movies featuring Daniel Craig.\n2. The data analyst will check the IMDB ratings and filter the movies based on the duration (less than 150 minutes).\n3. The streaming service expert will verify the availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n4.

{"agent": "StreamingService_Expert", "content": "To proceed with the task, I'll first gather all the Daniel Craig movies and their respective IMDB ratings. Then, I will filter them based on the duration (less than 150 minutes) and check which of them are available on Netflix (US).\n\n### Step 1: Identify Daniel Craig Movies\nHere's a list of notable movies featuring Daniel Craig:\n\n1. Layer Cake (2004)\n2. Casino Royale (2006)\n3. Quantum of Solace (2008)\n4. Skyfall (2012)\n5. Spectre (2015)\n6. No Time to Die (2021)\n\n### Step 2: IMDB Ratings and Duration\nNow, I'll gather the IMDB ratings and duration for each of these movies:\n\n- Layer Cake (2004) - IMDB Rating: 7.3, Duration: 105 minutes\n- Casino Royale (2006) - IMDB Rating: 8.0, Duration: 144 minutes\n- Quantum of Solace (2008) - IMDB Rating: 6.6, Duration: 106 minutes\n- Skyfall (2012) - IMDB Rating: 7.8, Duration: 143 minutes\n- Spectre (2015) - IMDB Rating: 6.8, Duration: 148 minutes\n- No Time to Die (2021) - IMDB Rating: 7.3, Duration: 163 minutes (excluded due to duration)\n\n### Step 3: Filter Movies Less Than 150 Minutes\nFiltered movies based on duration (less than 150 minutes):\n\n1. Layer Cake (2004) - IMDB Rating: 7.3\n2. Casino Royale (2006) - IMDB Rating: 8.0\n3. Quantum of Solace (2008) - IMDB Rating: 6.6\n4. Skyfall (2012) - IMDB Rating: 7.8\n5. Spectre (2015) - IMDB Rating: 6.8\n\n### Step 4: Check Availability on Netflix (US)\nI will check the availability for each of these filtered movies on Netflix (US) by performing web searches.\n\nI will run the following code snippets to verify the availability of the movies on Netflix:\n\n```python\nfrom functions import perform_web_search\n\n# Check availability on Netflix US for filtered movies\nresults = {}\nmovies_to_check = [\"Layer Cake 2004\", \"Casino Royale 2006\", \"Quantum of Solace 2008\", \"Skyfall 2012\", \"Spectre 2015\"]\n\nfor movie in movies_to_check:\n    results[movie] = perform_web_search(f\"{movie} Netflix US availability\")\n\nprint(results)\n```\n\nI will now execute the above code to verify the availability of these movies on Netflix (US)."}

{"agent": "StreamingService_Expert", "content": "It seems that there was an error due to the absence of the `functions` module in the execution environment. I will modify the approach and use a direct method to check the availability of the previously identified Daniel Craig movies on Netflix (US) by running a single search query for each movie one by one.\n\nLet's try checking the availability of each movie individually instead. I will run the availability check for \"Layer Cake\" and \"Casino Royale\" first since they are highly rated.\n\n### Updated Code to Check Availability\nI will execute the code below to check the availability of these movies on Netflix (US):\n\n```python\n# Check availability on Netflix US for each movie individually\navailability_layer_cake = perform_web_search(\"Layer Cake 2004 Netflix US availability\")\navailability_casino_royale = perform_web_search(\"Casino Royale 2006 Netflix US availability\")\n\nprint(availability_layer_cake)\nprint(availability_casino_royale)\n```\n\nNow, I will run this code to gather the availability information."}
