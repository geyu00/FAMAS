According to chapter 2 of the book, what author influenced this neurologist’s belief in “endopsychic myths”? Give the last name only.

I will suggest using a library designed for academic papers and book access, specifically one that can handle DOI links effectively.\n\n```sh\npip install scholarly\n```\n\nOnce the library is installed, I can search for the book's information and navigate to Chapter 2 to find the needed details.
