It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund.\n   - The transaction fees for the fund are $0.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We need to find the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n   - Fidelity offers several international emerging markets equity mutual funds, including the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The complete list of Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - Where to find: Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the percentage increase for each relevant fund over the specified period using the performance data.\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Fidelity likely offers several international emerging markets equity mutual funds, and some of these funds may have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance data is likely to be available on Fidelity's website or through financial data providers like MarketWatch or Yahoo Finance.\n   - The fund with the lowest percentage increase might have underperformed due to market conditions or specific investment strategies.\n   - Given the issues with automated web surfing, it might be more effective to manually navigate to the performance sections of the relevant funds on Fidelity's website or use a financial database like Morningstar for more reliable data.\n   - The Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) is one of the funds to consider, but there may be others that also meet the criteria of having $0 transaction fees.\n\n**REASONING FOR NEW EDUCATED GUESSES:**\n- **Manual Navigation:** The repeated errors with automated web surfing suggest that manual navigation might be more reliable for collecting the necessary data.\n- **Financial Databases:** Financial databases like Morningstar often provide detailed and accurate historical performance data, which can be crucial for this task.\n- **Multiple Funds:** While FEMKX is a known fund, there may be other Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees that need to be considered to ensure a comprehensive analysis.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Automated Web Surfing Issues:** The automated web surfing attempts encountered multiple errors, primarily due to the inability to locate specific elements on the web pages.

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund.\n   - The transaction fees for the fund are $0.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We need to find the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n   - Fidelity offers several international emerging markets equity mutual funds, including the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The complete list of Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - Where to find: Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the percentage increase for each relevant fund over the specified period using the performance data.\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Manual Navigation:** Given the repeated issues with automated web surfing, manual navigation to Fidelity's official website or financial databases like Morningstar is likely to be more reliable for collecting the necessary data.\n   - **Financial Databases:** Financial databases like Morningstar often provide detailed and accurate historical performance data, which can be crucial for this task.\n   - **Multiple Funds:** While the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) is a known fund, there may be other Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees that need to be considered to ensure a comprehensive analysis.\n   - **Data Reliability:** The performance data on financial databases like Morningstar is typically more reliable and consistent compared to data scraped from web pages, which can be affected by dynamic content loading and page structure changes.\n   - **Market Conditions:** The fund with the lowest percentage increase might have underperformed due to adverse market conditions or specific investment strategies that did not align well with the market trends during the period from May 2019 to May 2024.\n\n### Reasoning for New Educated Guesses:\n- **Manual Navigation:** The repeated errors with automated web surfing suggest that manual navigation might be more reliable for collecting the necessary data. This approach allows for better handling of dynamic content and reduces the risk of encountering technical issues.\n- **Financial Databases:** Financial databases like Morningstar are designed to provide detailed and accurate historical performance data. Using these databases can help ensure that the data collected is reliable and consistent.\n- **Data Reliability:** Financial databases are less prone to issues like dynamic content loading and page structure changes, which can cause problems for automated web scraping. This makes them a more trustworthy source for the required data.\n- **Market Conditions:** Understanding the market conditions and investment strategies can provide insights into why a particular fund might have underperformed. This can help in identifying the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Identify Relevant Fidelity Funds:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually navigate to Fidelity's official website and search for \"Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: List all the relevant funds found.\n\n2. **Collect Performance Data:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each fund, navigate to the performance section and collect the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If data is not available on Fidelity's website, use financial databases like Morningstar or Yahoo Finance.\n\n3. **Organize Data:**\n   - **Assistant**: Create a table with the following columns: Fund Name, Fund ID, Percentage Increase (May 2019 to May 2024).\n   - **Assistant**: Populate the table with the collected data.\n\n4. **Analyze Data:**\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each fund.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script provided below to identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n```python\n# Python script to identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data (replace with actual data)\ndata = {\n    'Fund Name': ['Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund', 'Another Fund', 'Yet Another Fund'],\n    'Fund ID': ['FEMKX', 'ANFID', 'YAFID'],\n    'Percentage Increase': [15.2, 10.5, 20.3]\n}\n\n# Create DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase\nlowest_increase_fund = df.loc[df['Percentage Increase'].idxmin()]\n\nprint(\"Fund with the lowest percentage increase:\")\nprint(lowest_increase_fund)\n```\n\n5. **Verify and Report Results:**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the results to ensure accuracy.\n   - **Assistant**: Prepare a concise report summarizing the findings, including the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the corresponding percentage increase.\n\n6. **Final Review:**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the entire process and results to ensure all requirements are met and no errors were made.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final answer to the original request.\n\nBy focusing on manual navigation and data collection, we can avoid the reliability issues associated with automated web surfing and ensure that we gather accurate and complete data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Automated Web Surfing Issues:** The automated web surfing attempts encountered multiple errors, primarily due to the inability to locate specific elements on the web pages.

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and additional educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund.\n   - The transaction fees for the fund are $0.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We need to find the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n   - Fidelity offers several international emerging markets equity mutual funds, including the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The complete list of Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - Where to find: Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the percentage increase for each relevant fund over the specified period using the performance data.\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Manual Navigation:** Given the repeated issues with automated web surfing, manual navigation to Fidelity's official website or financial databases like Morningstar is likely to be more reliable for collecting the necessary data.\n   - **Financial Databases:** Financial databases like Morningstar often provide detailed and accurate historical performance data, which can be crucial for this task.\n   - **Multiple Funds:** While the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) is a known fund, there may be other Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees that need to be considered to ensure a comprehensive analysis.\n   - **Data Reliability:** The performance data on financial databases like Morningstar is typically more reliable and consistent compared to data scraped from web pages, which can be affected by dynamic content loading and page structure changes.\n   - **Market Conditions:** The fund with the lowest percentage increase might have underperformed due to adverse market conditions or specific investment strategies that did not align well with the market trends during the period from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **Alternative Sources:** In addition to Fidelity's website, other financial news websites like CNBC, Bloomberg, or Yahoo Finance might also provide the necessary performance data for the funds, ensuring a more robust data collection process.\n   - **Network Issues:** The repeated `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` suggests that there might be network issues or server-side problems preventing the automated web surfer from accessing Fidelity's website. Manual navigation can bypass these issues.\n\n### Reasoning for New Educated Guesses:\n- **Manual Navigation:** The repeated errors with automated web surfing suggest that manual navigation might be more reliable for collecting the necessary data. This approach allows for better handling of dynamic content and reduces the risk of encountering technical issues.\n- **Financial Databases:** Financial databases like Morningstar are designed to provide detailed and accurate historical performance data. Using these databases can help ensure that the data collected is reliable and consistent.\n- **Data Reliability:** Financial databases are less prone to issues like dynamic content loading and page structure changes, which can cause problems for automated web scraping. This makes them a more trustworthy source for the required data.\n- **Market Conditions:** Understanding the market conditions and investment strategies can provide insights into why a particular fund might have underperformed. This can help in identifying the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n- **Alternative Sources:** Given the issues with accessing Fidelity's website, other financial news websites like CNBC, Bloomberg, or Yahoo Finance might also provide the necessary performance data for the funds, ensuring a more robust data collection process.\n- **Network Issues:** The repeated `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` indicates that there might be network issues or server-side problems preventing the automated web surfer from accessing Fidelity's website. Manual navigation can bypass these issues.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Identify Relevant Fidelity Funds:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually navigate to Fidelity's official website and search for \"Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: List all the relevant funds found, noting their names and IDs.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If data is not available on Fidelity's website, use financial databases like Morningstar or alternative financial news websites like CNBC, Bloomberg, or Yahoo Finance.\n\n2. **Collect Performance Data:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified fund, navigate to the performance section and collect the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Ensure to cross-reference data from multiple sources to verify accuracy.\n\n3. **Organize Data:**\n   - **Assistant**: Create a table with the following columns: Fund Name, Fund ID, Percentage Increase (May 2019 to May 2024).\n   - **Assistant**: Populate the table with the collected data.\n\n4. **Analyze Data:**\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each fund.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script provided below to identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n```python\n# Python script to identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data (replace with actual data)\ndata = {\n    'Fund Name': ['Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund', 'Another Fund', 'Yet Another Fund'],\n    'Fund ID': ['FEMKX', 'ANFID', 'YAFID'],\n    'Percentage Increase': [15.2, 10.5, 20.3]\n}\n\n# Create DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase\nlowest_increase_fund = df.loc[df['Percentage Increase'].idxmin()]\n\nprint(\"Fund with the lowest percentage increase:\")\nprint(lowest_increase_fund)\n```\n\n5. **Verify and Report Results:**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the results to ensure accuracy.\n   - **Assistant**: Prepare a concise report summarizing the findings, including the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the corresponding percentage increase.\n\n6. **Final Review:**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the entire process and results to ensure all requirements are met and no errors were made.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final answer to the original request.\n\nBy focusing on manual navigation, leveraging financial databases, and using alternative financial news websites, we can avoid the reliability issues associated with automated web surfing and ensure that we gather accurate and complete data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Automated Web Surfing Issues:** The automated web surfing attempts encountered multiple errors, primarily due to the inability to load the Fidelity website (`net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`). This could be due to network issues, server-side problems, or dynamic content loading.\n- **Reliability of Automated Tools:** The reliance on automated tools for navigating and extracting data from web pages proved unreliable, leading to repeated failures.\n- **Network Errors:** Specific errors like `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` indicate network issues or server-side problems that prevented the web surfer from successfully loading the pages.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Manual Navigation and Data Collection:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Manually navigate to Fidelity's official website and search for \"Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\"\n   - **WebSurfer**: List all the relevant funds found, noting their names and IDs.\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each identified fund, manually navigate to the performance section and collect the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If data is not available on Fidelity's website, use financial databases like Morningstar or alternative financial news websites like CNBC, Bloomberg, or Yahoo Finance.\n\n2. **Cross-Reference Data:**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Cross-reference the performance data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\n3. **Organize Data:**\n   - **Assistant**: Create a table with the following columns: Fund Name, Fund ID, Percentage Increase (May 2019 to May 2024).\n   - **Assistant**: Populate the table with the collected data.\n\n4. **Analyze Data:**\n   - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to calculate the percentage increase for each fund.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script provided below to identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n```python\n# Python script to identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data (replace with actual data)\ndata = {\n    'Fund Name': ['Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund', 'Another Fund', 'Yet Another Fund'],\n    'Fund ID': ['FEMKX', 'ANFID', 'YAFID'],\n    'Percentage Increase': [15.2, 10.5, 20.3]\n}\n\n# Create DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase\nlowest_increase_fund = df.loc[df['Percentage Increase'].idxmin()]\n\nprint(\"Fund with the lowest percentage increase:\")\nprint(lowest_increase_fund)\n```\n\n5. **Verify and Report Results:**\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the results to ensure accuracy.\n   - **Assistant**: Prepare a concise report summarizing the findings, including the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and the corresponding percentage increase.\n\n6. **Final Review:**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the entire process and results to ensure all requirements are met and no errors were made.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the final answer to the original request.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n- **Manual Navigation:** Use manual navigation to avoid the issues associated with automated web surfing.\n- **Financial Databases:** Utilize financial databases like Morningstar for more reliable and consistent data.\n- **Data Verification:** Double-check the data collected to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n- **Script Testing:** Test the Python script with sample data to ensure it works correctly before running it with the actual data.\n- **Multiple Sources:** Cross-reference data from multiple sources to ensure reliability and accuracy."}

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about a Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund.\n- The transaction fees for the fund are $0.\n- The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- We need to find the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n- Fidelity offers several international emerging markets equity mutual funds, including the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX).\n- Automated web surfing attempts to Fidelity's website have repeatedly failed due to `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The complete list of Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n- The performance data (specifically the percentage increase) of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- Where to find: Fidelity's official website, financial news websites, or financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Calculate the percentage increase for each relevant fund over the specified period using the performance data.\n- Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Manual Navigation:** Given the repeated issues with automated web surfing, manual navigation to Fidelity's official website or financial databases like Morningstar is likely to be more reliable for collecting the necessary data.\n- **Financial Databases:** Financial databases like Morningstar often provide detailed and accurate historical performance data, which can be crucial for this task.\n- **Multiple Funds:** While the Fidelity Emerging Markets Fund (FEMKX) is a known fund, there may be other Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees that need to be considered to ensure a comprehensive analysis.\n- **Data Reliability:** The performance data on financial databases like Morningstar is typically more reliable and consistent compared to data scraped from web pages, which can be affected by dynamic content loading and page structure changes.\n- **Market Conditions:** The fund with the lowest percentage increase might have underperformed due to adverse market conditions or specific investment strategies that did not align well with the market trends during the period from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- **Alternative Sources:** In addition to Fidelity's website, other financial news websites like CNBC, Bloomberg, or Yahoo Finance might also provide the necessary performance data for the funds, ensuring a more robust data collection process.\n- **Network Issues:** The repeated `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` suggests that there might be network issues or server-side problems preventing the automated web surfer from accessing Fidelity's website. Manual navigation can bypass these issues.\n- **Manual Data Entry:** Given the issues with automated tools, manually entering the data into a spreadsheet or database might be necessary to ensure accuracy and completeness. This can be time-consuming but will ensure that the data is correct and reliable.\n- **User Agent Spoofing:** The `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` might be caused by the website detecting the automated user agent. Using a different user agent or a more human-like browsing pattern might help in future automated attempts.\n\n### Reasoning for New Educated Guesses:\n- **Manual Navigation:** The repeated errors with automated web surfing suggest that manual navigation might be more reliable for collecting the necessary data. This approach allows for better handling of dynamic content and reduces the risk of encountering technical issues.\n- **Financial Databases:** Financial databases like Morningstar are designed to provide detailed and accurate historical performance data. Using these databases can help ensure that the data collected is reliable and consistent.\n- **Data Reliability:** Financial databases are less prone to issues like dynamic content loading and page structure changes, which can cause problems for automated web scraping. This makes them a more trustworthy source for the required data.\n- **Market Conditions:** Understanding the market conditions and investment strategies can provide insights into why a particular fund might have underperformed. This can help in identifying the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n- **Alternative Sources:** Given the issues with accessing Fidelity's website, other financial news websites like CNBC, Bloomberg, or Yahoo Finance might also provide the necessary performance data for the funds, ensuring a more robust data collection process.\n- **Network Issues:** The repeated `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` indicates that there might be network issues or server-side problems preventing the automated web surfer from accessing Fidelity's website. Manual navigation can bypass these issues.\n- **Manual Data Entry:** Given the issues with automated tools, manually entering the data into a spreadsheet or database might be necessary to ensure accuracy and completeness. This can be time-consuming but will ensure that the data is correct and reliable.\n- **User Agent Spoofing:** The `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` might be caused by the website detecting the automated user agent.

This approach allows for better handling of dynamic content and reduces the risk of encountering technical issues.\n- **Financial Databases:** Financial databases like Morningstar are designed to provide detailed and accurate historical performance data. Using these databases can help ensure that the data collected is reliable and consistent.\n- **Data Reliability:** Financial databases are less prone to issues like dynamic content loading and page structure changes, which can cause problems for automated web scraping. This makes them a more trustworthy source for the required data.\n- **Market Conditions:** Understanding the market conditions and investment strategies can provide insights into why a particular fund might have underperformed. This can help in identifying the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n- **Alternative Sources:** Given the issues with accessing Fidelity's website, other financial news websites like CNBC, Bloomberg, or Yahoo Finance might also provide the necessary performance data for the funds, ensuring a more robust data collection process.\n- **Network Issues:** The repeated `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` indicates that there might be network issues or server-side problems preventing the automated web surfer from accessing Fidelity's website. Manual navigation can bypass these issues.\n- **Manual Data Entry:** Given the issues with automated tools, manually entering the data into a spreadsheet or database might be necessary to ensure accuracy and completeness.
