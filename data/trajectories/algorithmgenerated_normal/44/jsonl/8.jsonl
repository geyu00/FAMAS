{"agent": "GraphicDesign_Expert", "content": "If we are unable to retrieve specific details about the symbol from Eva Draconis's website, I can share some general meanings of common symbols with curved lines that aren't circles. Here are a couple of possibilities:\n\n1. **Wave Symbol**: This could represent creativity, fluidity, and adaptability. In personal branding, it may suggest a connection to nature or a free-spirited approach.\n\n2. **Arc**: An arc can symbolize a journey, transition, or progression. It might indicate personal growth or a path that one is following.\n\nIf any of these symbols or meanings resonate with the context of her work, they could be relevant. However, if you find any specific details about the symbol used in the top banner once you check her page, please provide that information for a more tailored analysis. \n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!"}
