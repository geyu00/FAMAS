Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is as of May 2023.\n   - The line in question is the MBTA’s Franklin-Foxboro line.\n   - The starting point is South Station.\n   - The ending point is Windsor Gardens.\n   - The number of stops between these two points (excluding the endpoints) is what needs to be determined.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The current MBTA rail map or schedule for the Franklin-Foxboro line.\n   - The official MBTA website or their most recent transit guide.\n   - Any recent updates or changes to the MBTA’s rail lines that might affect the number of stops.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact number of stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens, excluding both endpoints, based on the current MBTA rail map or schedule.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on my general knowledge of the MBTA system, the Franklin-Foxboro line is known to have several stops between South Station and its outer terminus. However, without specific data, I cannot accurately guess the exact number of stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find the most recent MBTA rail map or schedule for the Franklin-Foxboro line.\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the official MBTA website or transit guide to locate the specific route information for the Franklin-Foxboro line.\n- **WebSurfer**: Identify the stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens on the Franklin-Foxboro line.\n- **WebSurfer**: Count the number of stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens, excluding both endpoints.\n- **Assistant**: Verify the count and prepare the final answer."}
