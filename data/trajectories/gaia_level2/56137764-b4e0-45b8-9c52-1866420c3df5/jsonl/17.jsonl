{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a contributor to a specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is the one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of OpenCV where support for Mask-RCNN was added.\n   - The contributors to that specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Authoritative sources for OpenCV contributors: OpenCV GitHub repository, official OpenCV documentation, release notes.\n   - Authoritative sources for Chinese heads of government: historical records, official government websites, reputable news sources.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the names of contributors to the specific version of OpenCV with the names of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most prominent former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor's name could be Deng Xiaoping, as his name is commonly transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Another possibility could be Jiang Zemin, another well-known former leader of China.\n   - The name \"Li\" is very common in China and could potentially match a contributor's name.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for the official OpenCV release notes or changelog.\n  - Look for the version number and release date where Mask-RCNN support was introduced.\n\n- **Find the contributors to that specific version of OpenCV:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to the OpenCV GitHub repository.\n  - Locate the commit history or contributors list for the identified version.\n  - Extract the names of the contributors.\n\n- **List the names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet:**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for a reliable source listing former Chinese heads of government.\n  - Transliterate the names to the Latin alphabet if necessary.\n\n- **Cross-reference the names of contributors with the names of former Chinese heads of government:**\n  - Manually compare the lists of names to find any matches.\n  - If a match is found, verify the spelling and context to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Summarize the findings:**\n  - Compile the results into a clear and concise answer.\n  - Provide the name of the contributor and the corresponding former Chinese head of government."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about a contributor to a specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is the one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - The OpenCV version 4.5.0, released in October 2020, includes significant updates to the DNN module, which might include the addition of Mask-RCNN support.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Confirm whether Mask-RCNN support was indeed added in OpenCV 4.5.0.\n   - Identify the contributors to OpenCV 4.5.0.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Authoritative sources for OpenCV contributors: OpenCV GitHub repository, official OpenCV documentation, release notes.\n   - Authoritative sources for Chinese heads of government: historical records, official government websites, reputable news sources.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the names of contributors to OpenCV 4.5.0 with the names of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most prominent former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor's name could be Deng Xiaoping, as his name is commonly transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Another possibility could be Jiang Zemin, another well-known former leader of China.\n   - The name \"Li\" is very common in China and could potentially match a contributor's name. For example, \"Li Keqiang\" or \"Li Peng.\"\n   - Given the contributors listed in the changelog for OpenCV 4.5.0, names like \"Liubov Batanina,\" \"YashasSamaga,\" and \"ZhangYin\" are potential candidates, but none of these names immediately match a former Chinese head of government.\n   - The name \"Kun Liang\" appears in the contributors list, which could be a match if it corresponds to a former Chinese head of government.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Confirm Mask-RCNN Support**: Verify from the official OpenCV release notes or documentation that Mask-RCNN support was indeed added in version 4.5.0.\n- **List Contributors**: Extract the full list of contributors for OpenCV 4.5.0 from the GitHub repository or the changelog.\n- **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**: Compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their Latin alphabet transliterations.\n- **Cross-Reference Names**: Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n\nLet's proceed with confirming the Mask-RCNN support in OpenCV 4.5.0.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incomplete Scrolling and Searching**: The previous attempts involved scrolling through the ChangeLog page but did not systematically search for the specific mention of Mask-RCNN support. This led to missing the relevant information.\n2. **Lack of Verification**: We did not verify whether Mask-RCNN support was indeed added in the version we were looking at, leading to uncertainty.\n3. **Incomplete Contributor List Extraction**: We did not extract a comprehensive list of contributors for the specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Locate Specific Version and Release Date**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the official OpenCV release notes or changelog specifically mentioning the addition of Mask-RCNN support.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the identified version's release notes and confirm the exact version and release date.\n\n2. **Extract Comprehensive Contributor List**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the entire changelog for the identified version to extract a comprehensive list of contributors.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Copy the list of contributors and provide it for further analysis.\n\n3. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for a reliable source listing former Chinese heads of government and their Latin alphabet transliterations.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Copy the list of names and provide it for further analysis.\n\n4. **Cross-Reference Names**:\n   - **Assistant**: Manually compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the spelling and context to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the results into a clear and concise answer.\n   - **Assistant**: Provide the name of the contributor and the corresponding former Chinese head of government.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Locate Specific Version and Release Date**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"OpenCV release notes Mask-RCNN support added\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the official OpenCV release notes or changelog.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Find the specific version and release date where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n\n- **Step 2: Extract Comprehensive Contributor List**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the identified version's release notes.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the entire changelog and extract the list of contributors.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Copy the list of contributors and provide it.\n\n- **Step 3: List Former Chinese Heads of Government**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"former Chinese heads of government Latin alphabet\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to a reliable source and extract the list of names.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Copy the list of names and provide it.\n\n- **Step 4: Cross-Reference Names**\n  - **Assistant**: Manually compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n  - **Assistant**: Identify any matches and verify the spelling and context.\n\n- **Step 5: Summarize Findings**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the results into a clear and concise answer.\n  - **Assistant**: Provide the name of the contributor and the corresponding former Chinese head of government.\n\nThis plan ensures a systematic approach to finding the required information and avoids the previous issues by focusing on thorough verification and extraction of necessary data."}

Here is the comparative performance table (showing inference time in milliseconds for batch_size=1 on different topologies and different ARM architectures; tested on EAIDK-610):\nG-API module:\nAdded Python bindings for the general G-API (\n#17493), inference and streaming support are currently in progress.\nIntroduced serialization API, currently limited. A graph can be serialized to a byte stream (std::vector) and then reconstructed back to a \ncv::GComputation object.\nOpenVINO NN backend has been moved to the latest OpenVINO \"Core\" APIs.\nNow it is easier to declare a graph with a dynamic number of inputs or outputs (\nGIn() / \nGOut() support \noperator+=).\nAdded \"mask\", extended \"convertTo\" with 16S, also added performance tests on Core kernels for the Fluid backend.\nAdded standard NN post-processing operations like \nparseYolo and \nparseSSD to turn NN results into a structured graph-based data format (e.g. \nGArray<Rect>).\nAdded value initialization for \nGArray<T> so now one can write:\ncv::GArray<\nint> arr = std::vector<\nint> { \n1, \n2, \n3 };\nto associate a \ncv::GArray<> with a value at graph construction stage.\ncv::GMat bitwise operators are extended with a \ncv::GScalar operand.\nIntroduced a new graph data type \ncv::GFrame and its data storage type \ncv::MediaFrame to start handling media-oriented formats (like NV12 or YUV images with external memory) in the graph.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The paramount leader is the person who holds the highest authority of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC).\n\nSince the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, there have been seven paramount leaders, each holding the position of General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and/or President of the People's Republic of China. The list below includes the most prominent figures who have held these positions.\n\nContents\n1 Paramount leaders\n2 General Secretaries of the Chinese Communist Party\n3 Chairmen of the Central Military Commission\n4 Presidents of the People's Republic of China\n5 Premier of the State Council\n6 References\nParamount leaders\nThe paramount leader holds the highest authority of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC).
