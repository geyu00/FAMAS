Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) for purchase or rental.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film on IMDB.\n   - The runtime of the highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film.\n   - Availability of the highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether the highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film meets the criteria of being less than 2 hours long and available on Fandango at Home.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, so it is likely that one of her films will meet the criteria.\n   - Given the popularity of streaming platforms, it is probable that at least one of her highly-rated films is available on Fandango at Home.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for Isabelle Adjani's filmography on IMDB.\n- **Step 2:** Identify the highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film on IMDB.\n- **Step 3:** Use WebSurfer to check the runtime of the identified film on IMDB.\n- **Step 4:** If the film is less than 2 hours, use WebSurfer to search for its availability on Fandango at Home.\n- **Step 5:** Verify the availability of the film on Fandango at Home and note the option to buy or rent.\n- **Step 6:** Compile and present the final information, including the film's title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and progress made:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) for purchase or rental.\n   - 'The Story of Adele H' (1975) is a highly-rated Isabelle Adjani film with an IMDB rating of 7.2 and a runtime of 1 hour 36 minutes.\n   - 'Camille Claudel' (1989) is another highly-rated Isabelle Adjani film with an IMDB rating of 7.3 and a runtime of 2 hours 55 minutes, which exceeds the 2-hour limit.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The next highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours long.\n   - Availability of 'The Story of Adele H' on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n   - Availability of other highly-rated Isabelle Adjani films that are less than 2 hours long on Fandango at Home.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether 'The Story of Adele H' or another highly-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours long is available on Fandango at Home for purchase or rental.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, so it is likely that one of her films will meet the criteria.\n   - Given the popularity of streaming platforms, it is probable that at least one of her highly-rated films is available on Fandango at Home.\n   - Since 'The Story of Adele H' is a well-known and critically acclaimed film, it is reasonable to assume that it might be available on Fandango at Home.\n   - If 'The Story of Adele H' is not available, other highly-rated films like 'La Gifle' (The Slap) or 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' might be worth checking for availability, as they are also highly rated and meet the runtime requirement.\n\nLet's proceed by verifying the availability of 'The Story of Adele H' on Fandango at Home again, and if it's not available, we will check the next highest-rated film that meets the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Ineffective Search Queries**: The search queries used on Fandango at Home were not specific enough to directly find Isabelle Adjani's films. The search results included many unrelated titles.\n2. **Lack of Direct Verification**: We did not directly verify the availability of 'The Story of Adele H' on Fandango at Home by navigating to the film's page or using a more targeted search method.\n3. **Incomplete Data Collection**: We did not systematically check the availability of other highly-rated Isabelle Adjani films that meet the runtime requirement.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Query**:\n   - Use a more specific search query on Fandango at Home, such as \"The Story of Adele H Isabelle Adjani\" or \"Isabelle Adjani The Story of Adele H\".\n   - If the film is not found, use a broader search term like \"Isabelle Adjani movies\" and manually filter the results to find 'The Story of Adele H'.\n\n2. **Direct Navigation**:\n   - If the search does not yield direct results, manually navigate through the categories on Fandango at Home to find the film.\n   - Check the \"Foreign Films\" or \"Classics\" sections, as these are likely to contain older, critically acclaimed films.\n\n3. **Check Next Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - If 'The Story of Adele H' is not available, move to the next highest-rated Isabelle Adjani film that meets the runtime requirement.\n   - For example, check 'La Gifle' (The Slap) or 'Nosferatu the Vampyre', both of which are highly rated and under 2 hours.\n\n4. **Verify Availability**:\n   - Once the film is found, verify its availability for purchase or rental on Fandango at Home.\n   - Note the price and any additional details about the availability.\n\n5. **Compile Final Information**:\n   - Compile the final information, including the film's title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to search for \"The Story of Adele H Isabelle Adjani\" on Fandango at Home.\n- **Step 2**: If the film is not found, use the search term \"Isabelle Adjani movies\" and manually filter the results to find 'The Story of Adele H'.\n- **Step 3**: If still not found, navigate to the \"Foreign Films\" or \"Classics\" sections on Fandango at Home.\n- **Step 4**: Verify the availability of 'The Story of Adele H' for purchase or rental.\n- **Step 5**: If 'The Story of Adele H' is not available, search for 'La Gifle' (The Slap) or 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' and verify their availability.\n- **Step 6**: Compile and present the final information, including the film's title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the new information and progress made:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) for purchase or rental.\n   - 'The Story of Adele H' (1975) is a highly-rated Isabelle Adjani film with an IMDB rating of 7.2 and a runtime of 1 hour 36 minutes.\n   - 'Camille Claudel' (1989) is another highly-rated Isabelle Adjani film with an IMDB rating of 7.3 and a runtime of 2 hours 55 minutes, which exceeds the 2-hour limit.\n   - 'The Story of Adele H' is not currently available for purchase or rental on Fandango at Home.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The next highest-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours long.\n   - Availability of 'La Gifle' (The Slap) and 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' on Fandango at Home.\n   - Availability of other highly-rated Isabelle Adjani films that are less than 2 hours long on Fandango at Home.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Whether 'La Gifle' (The Slap) or 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' or another highly-rated Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours long is available on Fandango at Home for purchase or rental.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, so it is likely that one of her films will meet the criteria.\n   - Given the popularity of streaming platforms, it is probable that at least one of her highly-rated films is available on Fandango at Home.\n   - 'La Gifle' (The Slap) is a highly-rated Isabelle Adjani film with an IMDB rating of 7.8 and a runtime of 1 hour 34 minutes, making it a strong candidate to check for availability.\n   - 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' is another highly-rated Isabelle Adjani film with an IMDB rating of 7.3 and a runtime of 1 hour 52 minutes, also making it a strong candidate to check for availability.\n   - If neither 'La Gifle' nor 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' is available, other highly-rated films like 'Possession' (1981) or 'The Tenant' (1976) might be worth checking, although their runtimes need to be verified.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Query**:\n   - Use a more specific search query on Fandango at Home, such as \"La Gifle Isabelle Adjani\" or \"Nosferatu the Vampyre Isabelle Adjani\".\n   - If the films are not found, use a broader search term like \"Isabelle Adjani movies\" and manually filter the results to find 'La Gifle' and 'Nosferatu the Vampyre'.\n\n2. **Direct Navigation**:\n   - If the search does not yield direct results, manually navigate through the categories on Fandango at Home to find the films.\n   - Check the \"Foreign Films\" or \"Classics\" sections, as these are likely to contain older, critically acclaimed films.\n\n3. **Check Next Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - If 'La Gifle' and 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' are not available, move to the next highest-rated Isabelle Adjani film that meets the runtime requirement.\n   - For example, check 'Possession' (1981) or 'The Tenant' (1976), but verify their runtimes first.\n\n4. **Verify Availability**:\n   - Once the film is found, verify its availability for purchase or rental on Fandango at Home.\n   - Note the price and any additional details about the availability.\n\n5. **Compile Final Information**:\n   - Compile the final information, including the film's title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to search for \"La Gifle Isabelle Adjani\" on Fandango at Home.\n- **Step 2**: If 'La Gifle' is not found, search for \"Nosferatu the Vampyre Isabelle Adjani\".\n- **Step 3**: If neither film is found, use the search term \"Isabelle Adjani movies\" and manually filter the results to find 'La Gifle' and 'Nosferatu the Vampyre'.\n- **Step 4**: If still not found, navigate to the \"Foreign Films\" or \"Classics\" sections on Fandango at Home.\n- **Step 5**: Verify the availability of 'La Gifle' or 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' for purchase or rental.\n- **Step 6**: If neither film is available, search for 'Possession' (1981) or 'The Tenant' (1976) and verify their runtimes and availability.\n- **Step 7**: Compile and present the final information, including the film's title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\nPlease search for 'La Gifle Isabelle Adjani' on Fandango at Home and verify if it is available for purchase or rental. If it is not found, search for 'Nosferatu the Vampyre Isabelle Adjani'. If neither is found, use the search term \"Isabelle Adjani movies\" and manually filter the results to find 'La Gifle' and 'Nosferatu the Vampyre'. If still not found, navigate to the \"Foreign Films\" or \"Classics\" sections.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Ineffective Search Queries**: The search queries used on Fandango at Home were too broad and did not directly lead to the specific films we were looking for.\n2. **Lack of Direct Verification**: We did not directly verify the availability of 'La Gifle' or 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' by navigating to their specific pages or using more targeted search methods.\n3. **Incomplete Data Collection**: We did not systematically check the availability of other highly-rated Isabelle Adjani films that meet the runtime requirement.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific search terms on Fandango at Home, such as \"La Gifle Isabelle Adjani\" and \"Nosferatu the Vampyre Isabelle Adjani\".\n   - If these specific searches do not yield results, use a broader search term like \"Isabelle Adjani movies\" and manually filter the results to find 'La Gifle' and 'Nosferatu the Vampyre'.\n\n2. **Direct Navigation**:\n   - If the films are not found directly, manually navigate through the categories on Fandango at Home to find the films.\n   - Check the \"Foreign Films\" or \"Classics\" sections, as these are likely to contain older, critically acclaimed films.\n\n3. **Check Next Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - If 'La Gifle' and 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' are not available, move to the next highest-rated Isabelle Adjani film that meets the runtime requirement.\n   - For example, check 'Possession' (1981) or 'The Tenant' (1976), but verify their runtimes first.\n\n4. **Verify Availability**:\n   - Once the film is found, verify its availability for purchase or rental on Fandango at Home.\n   - Note the price and any additional details about the availability.\n\n5. **Compile Final Information**:\n   - Compile the final information, including the film's title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to search for \"La Gifle Isabelle Adjani\" on Fandango at Home.\n- **Step 2**: If 'La Gifle' is not found, search for \"Nosferatu the Vampyre Isabelle Adjani\".\n- **Step 3**: If neither film is found, use the search term \"Isabelle Adjani movies\" and manually filter the results to find 'La Gifle' and 'Nosferatu the Vampyre'.\n- **Step 4**: If still not found, navigate to the \"Foreign Films\" or \"Classics\" sections on Fandango at Home.\n- **Step 5**: Verify the availability of 'La Gifle' or 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' for purchase or rental.\n- **Step 6**: If neither film is available, search for 'Possession' (1981) or 'The Tenant' (1976) and verify their runtimes and availability.\n- **Step 7**: Compile and present the final information, including the film's title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\nPlease search for 'La Gifle Isabelle Adjani' on Fandango at Home and verify if it is available for purchase or rental. If it is not found, search for 'Nosferatu the Vampyre Isabelle Adjani'. If neither is found, use the search term \"Isabelle Adjani movies\" and manually filter the results to find 'La Gifle' and 'Nosferatu the Vampyre'. If still not found, navigate to the \"Foreign Films\" or \"Classics\" sections."}
