Instead of using the existing code, I will provide a new code snippet that is self-contained and includes the installation check directly. This new code will also run if necessary.

{"agent": "Validation_Expert", "content": "It seems the execution context is attempting to interpret the Python code as a shell script, leading to syntax errors.
