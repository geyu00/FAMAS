{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Magic: The Gathering Standard card (non-foil paper version released in its original set) that was banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns (including Oko, Crown of Thorns) had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned at the same time.\n   - We are looking for a non-foil paper version of a Magic: The Gathering Standard card released in its original set.\n   - The card must have been banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns.\n   - We need to find the card that had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact date when Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns were banned.\n   - A list of all cards banned on the same date as Oko, Thief of Crowns.\n   - The historical price data for each of these cards, including their all-time high and all-time low prices.\n   - The release sets of the cards to ensure they are from their original sets.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the price decrease for each card by subtracting the all-time low price from the all-time high price.\n   - Identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Cards that were popular or highly played in competitive formats are more likely to experience significant price drops when banned.\n   - Cards from the same set as Oko, Thief of Crowns (Throne of Eldraine) might be among the candidates.\n   - Cards with strong synergies with Oko, Thief of Crowns might also have experienced significant price drops.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Ban Date of Oko, Thief of Crowns**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for the official Wizards of the Coast (WotC) announcement of the ban list that included Oko, Thief of Crowns and note the date.\n\n- **List All Cards Banned on the Same Date**\n  - Use WebSurfer to find the complete list of cards banned on the identified date.\n\n- **Verify Original Set Releases**\n  - Use WebSurfer to verify that each card on the list was released in its original set.\n\n- **Collect Historical Price Data**\n  - Use WebSurfer to navigate to a reputable Magic: The Gathering price tracking website (e.g., TCGplayer, MTG Goldfish) to gather the all-time high and all-time low prices for each card.\n\n- **Calculate Price Decreases**\n  - Use Assistant to write a Python script to calculate the price decrease for each card by subtracting the all-time low price from the all-time high price.\n\n- **Identify the Card with the Highest Price Decrease**\n  - Use Assistant to analyze the results from the Python script and identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n- **Summarize and Present the Findings**\n  - Use Assistant to compile the findings into a clear and concise answer to the original request."}

The card had become a central figure in Simic-based Food decks, which dominated competitive play, accounting for over 60% of the field at major tournaments. Oko's ability to create powerful board states quickly and its high win rate against other decks led to a lack of diversity in gameplay and deck strategies. Hipsters of the Coast\n+1\nImpact on the Metagame\nThe ban of Oko is expected to improve the health of the Standard format by allowing for a more diverse range of competitive decks. Oko's presence had significantly skewed the metagame, making it difficult for other strategies to compete effectively. By removing Oko, Wizards aims to restore balance and encourage a wider variety of deck archetypes in competitive play.
