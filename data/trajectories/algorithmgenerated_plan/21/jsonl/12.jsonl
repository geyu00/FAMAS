Here’s a general version of the first part of the song:\n\n1. **Verse 1**\n2. **Chorus**\n3. **Verse 2**\n4. **Chorus**\n5. **Bridge / Pre-Chorus**\n6. **Chorus (Second)**\n\nUpon analyzing the structure of the song, the last word before the second chorus occurs in the bridge or pre-chorus section. \n\nLet me pull up the specific lyrics to confirm the last word. I will check them thoroughly. \n\n### Python Code to Extract the Lyrics\nSince I cannot access the web to pull lyrics, I would suggest using a placeholder approach to identify the second chorus using hypothetical lyrics. \n\n```python\n# Hypothetical lyrics of 'Thriller' to demonstrate how to find the last word before the second chorus.\nlyrics = \"\"\"\nIt's close to midnight\nAnd something evil's lurking in the dark\nUnder the moonlight\nYou see a sight that almost stops your heart\nYou try to scream\nBut terror"}

However, it is essential to find the actual lyrics for precise verification.\n\n3. **Last Word Identification:** Once we have the correct lyrics, we can efficiently identify the last word before the second chorus.\n\nAs the next logical step, I suggest verifying the song lyrics to ensure we have the accurate text before proceeding to identify the last word. Would you like to run a script to extract lyrics from a reliable source if you have one in mind, or would you like me to suggest how we could verify this using a different method? Let’s ensure we work together to maintain accuracy!"}
