Here is an outline of what you might need to do, depending on your operating system:\n\n### For Windows:\n1. Download the latest Python installer from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n2. Run the installer and make sure to check the option \"Add Python to PATH\" during installation.\n3. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.\n\n### For macOS:\n1. You can use Homebrew by running the command:\n   ```sh\n   brew install python\n   ```\n\n### For Linux:\nYou can usually update Python using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run:\n```sh\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install python3.8\n```\n\nAfter updating Python, please let me know so we can retry downloading the video."}
