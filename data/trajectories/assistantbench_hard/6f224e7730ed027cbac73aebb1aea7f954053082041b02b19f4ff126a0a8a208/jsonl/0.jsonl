Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO.\n   - The question asks about members of Fubo's Management Team who joined the company during the same year as the IPO.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The year Fubo went public (IPO).\n   - The names and join dates of the current members of Fubo's Management Team.\n   - These details can likely be found on Fubo’s official website, in their SEC filings, press releases, and investor relations pages.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the year of the IPO with the join dates of the management team members to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Fubo's IPO likely occurred within the last few years, given the company's relatively recent rise in the streaming market.\n   - Some key executives often join a company around the time of its IPO to support growth and expansion.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to find the year Fubo went public (IPO).\n  - Search for \"Fubo IPO year\" on a reliable financial news site or Fubo’s official investor relations page.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to gather the names and join dates of Fubo's current management team.\n  - Navigate to Fubo’s official website and locate the \"Management Team\" or \"About Us\" section.\n  - Alternatively, search for \"Fubo management team\" on a reliable business news site or Fubo’s official investor relations page.\n\n- **Step 3:** Cross-reference the IPO year with the join dates of the management team members.\n  - Identify which members joined in the same year as the IPO.\n\n- **Step 4:** Compile the final list of management team members who joined during the IPO year.\n  - Present the list in a clear and concise format."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich members of Fubo's Management Team joined the company during the same year Fubo's IPO happened?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO in October 2020.\n   - The question asks about members of Fubo's Management Team who joined the company during the same year as the IPO.\n   - Gina DiGioia joined Fubo in 2020 as senior vice president, general counsel, and corporate secretary.\n   - John Janedis joined Fubo in 2022 as chief financial officer.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The names and join dates of the other current members of Fubo's Management Team.\n   - These details can likely be found on Fubo’s official website, in their SEC filings, press releases, and investor relations pages.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the year of the IPO (2020) with the join dates of the management team members to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Since Fubo's IPO occurred in 2020, it is likely that some key executives joined the company around that time to support the transition to a public company.\n   - Given that Gina DiGioia joined in 2020, it is reasonable to assume that other key hires might have also joined around the same time to support the IPO and subsequent growth.\n   - We should continue to look for the join dates of other executives, particularly David Gandler and Alberto Horihuela, to confirm if they joined in 2020 or earlier.\n\n### Updated Plan\n- **Step 1:** Verify the join dates of David Gandler and Alberto Horihuela.\n  - Search for detailed biographies or press releases on Fubo’s official website, SEC filings, or reliable business news sites.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Confirm the join dates of any other management team members.\n  - Use the same sources to find join dates for other executives.\n\n- **Step 3:** Cross-reference the IPO year (2020) with the join dates of the management team members.\n  - Identify which members joined in the same year as the IPO.\n\n- **Step 4:** Compile the final list of management team members who joined during the IPO year.\n  - Present the list in a clear and concise format.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Inefficient Search Strategy**: The search queries used were too broad and did not target specific sources like Fubo's official website or SEC filings effectively.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: The search terms did not clearly specify the need for join dates, leading to irrelevant results.\n- **Redundant Searches**: Multiple searches were conducted without varying the approach, leading to repetitive results.\n\n### New Plan\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Queries**\n  - Use more specific search terms to target Fubo's official website and SEC filings.\n  - Example query: `\"John Janedis join date Fubo site:fubo.tv\"` and `\"Alberto Horihuela join date Fubo site:fubo.tv\"`.\n\n- **Step 2: Directly Access Fubo's Press Releases and SEC Filings**\n  - Navigate to Fubo's official investor relations page and press release section.\n  - Search for press releases or SEC filings that mention the appointment of key executives.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify Join Dates**\n  - For each executive, find and verify their join date from the most reliable source (e.g., official press release, SEC filing).\n\n- **Step 4: Cross-Reference with IPO Year**\n  - Compare the verified join dates with the IPO year (2020) to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n- **Step 5: Compile and Present the Final List**\n  - Create a list of management team members who joined in 2020 and present it clearly.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Queries**\n  - Use the search bar to enter the following queries:\n    - `\"John Janedis join date Fubo site:fubo.tv\"`\n    - `\"Alberto Horihuela join date Fubo site:fubo.tv\"`\n\n- **Step 2: Directly Access Fubo's Press Releases and SEC Filings**\n  - Navigate to Fubo’s official investor relations page: `https://ir.fubo.tv`.\n  - Click on the \"Press Releases\" section.\n  - Look for press releases that mention the appointments of John Janedis and Alberto Horihuela.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify Join Dates**\n  - For John Janedis:\n    - Search for press releases or SEC filings that mention his appointment as CFO.\n  - For Alberto Horihuela:\n    - Search for press releases or SEC filings that mention his roles and join dates.\n\n- **Step 4: Cross-Reference with IPO Year**\n  - Confirm that the join dates of the identified executives match the IPO year (2020).\n\n- **Step 5: Compile and Present the Final List**\n  - List the names of management team members who joined in 2020.\n\n### Example Actions\n- **WebSurfer:**\n  - Search for `\"John Janedis join date Fubo site:fubo.tv\"`.\n  - Navigate to Fubo’s official investor relations page: `https://ir.fubo.tv`.\n  - Click on the \"Press Releases\" section.\n  - Look for relevant press releases and SEC filings.\n  - Summarize the join dates found for John Janedis and Alberto Horihuela.\n  - Cross-reference these dates with the IPO year (2020).\n\n- **Final Presentation:**\n  - List of management team members who joined in 2020:\n    - Gina DiGioia (joined in 2020)\n    - Any other executives found to have joined in 2020."}
