I will start by reading the provided Excel file, filtering out the steam locomotives, and then calculating the total number of wheels based on the Whyte notation for each configuration.\n\nLet's proceed with executing this step by step. I will run the initial code to load the data and inspect the unique wheel configurations. After that, we'll filter and sum the wheels.\n\nHereâ€™s the code block to do that:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the Excel file\nfile_path = \"../2023/validation/54612da3-fd56-4941-80f4-5eb82330de25.xlsx\"\ndata = pd.read_excel(file_path)\n\n# Extract the 'Type/Wheel Configuration' column\nwheel_configurations = data['Type/Wheel Configuration'].dropna().unique()\n\n# Display the unique wheel configurations\nprint(wheel_configurations)\n``` \n\nI will now execute this code to gather the necessary information on the steam locomotives."}
