His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as Bond.He was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II at the 2022 Queen's New Years Honours for his services to Film and Theatre.Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy\n21 wins & 82 nominations totalPhotos\n901\n+ 895\nKnown for\nNo Time to Die\n7.3\nJames Bond2021Casino Royale\n8.0\nJames Bond2006Skyfall\n7.8\nJames Bond2012Spectre\n6.8\nJames Bond2015Credits\nEdit\nMore to explore\nList\nIMDb Summer Watch Guide\nBrowse the guide\nEditorial lists\nRelated lists created by IMDb editors\nIMDb staff picks: The best movies & series of 2022\nupdated 2 years ago\n‚Ä¢\n56 images\nWeekend box office: Nov. 24 to Nov. 27\nupdated 2 years ago\n‚Ä¢\n10 images\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Daniel Craig movie that is less than 150 minutes and is available on Netflix (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The movie must feature Daniel Craig.\n   - The movie must have an IMDb rating.\n   - The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n   - The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of Daniel Craig movies.\n   - IMDb ratings for each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - Runtime of each of Daniel Craig's movies.\n   - Availability of each of Daniel Craig's movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify which of Daniel Craig's movies meet all the criteria: IMDb rating, runtime, and availability on Netflix (US).\n   - Determine the highest-rated movie among those that meet all the criteria.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on general knowledge, Daniel Craig is known for his role as James Bond, but he has also starred in other films.\n   - Some of his non-Bond films, such as \"Knives Out,\" are highly rated and might fit the criteria.\n   - \"Knives Out\" is a popular film and is likely to be available on streaming platforms like Netflix.\n   - \"Skyfall\" and \"Casino Royale\" are highly rated James Bond films, but they are typically longer than 150 minutes.\n   - \"Logan Lucky\" and \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" are well-received films that might be shorter than 150 minutes and could be available on Netflix.\n   - \"Dream House\" is another film that might fit the criteria, given its moderate runtime and rating.\n\n5. **NEW INFORMATION**\n   - We have identified several of Daniel Craig's movies and their IMDb ratings, but we still need to confirm their runtimes and Netflix (US) availability.\n   - Some of the movies listed include:\n     - **No Time to Die (2021)**: Rating 7.3\n     - **Spectre (2015)**: Rating 6.8\n     - **Skyfall (2012)**: Rating 7.8\n     - **The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)**: Rating 7.8\n     - **The Adventures of Tintin (2011)**: Rating 7.3\n     - **Dream House (2011)**: Rating 6.0\n     - **Infamous (2006)**: Rating 7.0\n     - **Munich (2005)**: Rating 7.8\n     - **The Jacket (2005)**: Rating 6.8\n     - **Casino Royale (2006)**: Rating 8.0\n     - **Layer Cake (2004)**: Rating 7.3\n     - **Love Actually (2003)**: Rating 7.0\n     - **Enduring Love (2003)**: Rating 6.7\n     - **The Invasion (2003)**: Rating 6.3\n     - **Plunkett & Macleane (2002)**: Rating 5.4\n     - **Road to Perdition (2002)**: Rating 8.2\n     - **The Power of One (2000)**: Rating 6.9\n     - **Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon (1998)**: Rating 7.1\n     - **The Mother (2003)**: Rating 6.5\n     - **The Trench (1999)**: Rating 6.4\n     - **Flashbacks of a Fool (2008)**: Rating 6.8\n     - **Knives Out (2019)**: Rating 7.9\n\n6. **NEXT STEPS**\n   - **Extract Runtimes:** Confirm the runtimes for each of the listed movies.\n   - **Check Netflix Availability:** Use WebSurfer to check the availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n   - **Filter Movies:** Filter out movies that are 150 minutes or longer.\n   - **Identify Highest-Rated Movie:** Determine the highest-rated movie among those that meet all the criteria.\n\nWould you like to proceed with extracting the runtimes for each of these movies?\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incomplete Data Extraction**: The runtimes for the movies were not extracted, which is crucial for filtering movies based on the 150-minute criterion.\n2. **Manual Scrolling Issues**: The manual scrolling process was inefficient and did not ensure that all necessary data was captured.\n3. **Lack of Structured Approach**: The process lacked a structured approach to ensure that all required information (ratings, runtimes, and Netflix availability) was systematically collected.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Extract Movie List and Basic Details**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Daniel Craig's IMDb page and extract the list of movies, including titles, IMDb ratings, and roles.\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each movie, navigate to its individual IMDb page to extract the runtime.\n\n2. **Filter Movies by Runtime**:\n   - **Python Script**: Use a Python script to filter out movies that are 150 minutes or longer based on the extracted runtimes.\n\n3. **Check Netflix Availability**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each filtered movie, check its availability on Netflix (US) using a web search or by navigating to Netflix's website.\n\n4. **Identify Highest-Rated Movie**:\n   - **Python Script**: Use a Python script to identify the highest-rated movie among those that meet all the criteria.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Extract Movie List and Basic Details**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to [Daniel Craig's IMDb page](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll through the page and extract the titles, IMDb ratings, and roles for each movie.\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each movie, navigate to its individual IMDb page and extract the runtime.\n\n2. **Filter Movies by Runtime**:\n   -

**WebSurfer**: For each movie in the `filtered_movies` list, search for its availability on Netflix (US) using a web search or by navigating to Netflix's website.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Record whether each movie is available on Netflix (US).\n\n4. **Identify Highest-Rated Movie**:\n   - **Python Script**:\n     ```python\n     # Sample data structure with Netflix availability\n     filtered_movies_with_netflix = [\n         {\"title\": \"The Adventures of Tintin\", \"rating\": 7.3, \"runtime\": 107, \"netflix_available\": True},\n         {\"title\": \"Dream House\", \"rating\": 6.0, \"runtime\": 112, \"netflix_available\": False},\n         {\"title\": \"Infamous\", \"rating\": 7.0, \"runtime\": 111, \"netflix_available\": True},\n         {\"title\": \"The Jacket\", \"rating\": 6.8, \"runtime\": 112, \"netflix_available\": False},\n         {\"title\": \"Layer Cake\", \"rating\": 7.3, \"runtime\": 108, \"netflix_available\": True},\n         {\"title\": \"Love Actually\", \"rating\": 7.0, \"runtime\": 135, \"netflix_available\": True},\n         {\"title\": \"Enduring Love\", \"rating\": 6.7, \"runtime\": 105, \"netflix_available\": True},\n         {\"title\": \"The Invasion\", \"rating\": 6.3, \"runtime\": 105, \"netflix_available\": True},\n         {\"title\": \"Plunkett & Macleane\", \"rating\": 5.4, \"runtime\": 110, \"netflix_available\": False},\n         {\"title\": \"The Mother\", \"rating\": 6.5, \"runtime\": 92, \"netflix_available\": True},\n         {\"title\": \"The Trench\", \"rating\": 6.4, \"runtime\": 90, \"netflix_available\": True},\n         {\"title\": \"Flashbacks of a Fool\", \"rating\": 6.8, \"runtime\": 97, \"netflix_available\": True},\n         {\"title\": \"Knives Out\", \"rating\": 7.9, \"runtime\": 130, \"netflix_available\": True}\n     ]\n\n     # Filter movies available on Netflix\n     netflix_movies = [movie for movie in filtered_movies_with_netflix if movie[\"netflix_available\"]]\n\n     # Identify the highest-rated movie\n     highest_rated_movie = max(netflix_movies, key=lambda x: x[\"rating\"])\n     print(highest_rated_movie)\n     ```\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Start by navigating to Daniel Craig's IMDb page and extracting the list of movies, including titles, IMDb ratings, and roles.\n2. **WebSurfer**: For each movie, navigate to its individual IMDb page and extract the runtime.\n3. **Python Script**: Run the provided Python script to filter movies by runtime.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Check the availability of the filtered movies on Netflix (US).\n5. **Python Script**: Run the provided Python script to identify the highest-rated movie among those that meet all the criteria.\n\nLet's start with the first step.

His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \"Ring O'Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig has English, as well as Irish, Scottish and Welsh, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations.

His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \"Ring O'Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig has English, as well as Irish, Scottish and Welsh, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as Bond.He was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II at the 2022 Queen's New Years Honours for his services to Film and Theatre.Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy\n21 wins & 82 nominations totalPhotos\n901\n+ 895\nKnown for\nNo Time to Die\n7.3\nJames Bond2021Casino Royale\n8.0\nJames Bond2006Skyfall\n7.8\nJames Bond2012Spectre\n6.8\nJames Bond2015More to explore\nList\nIMDb Summer Watch Guide\nBrowse the guide\nEditorial lists\nRelated lists created by IMDb editors\nIMDb staff picks: The best movies & series of 2022\nupdated 2 years ago\n‚Ä¢\n56 images\nWeekend box office: Nov. 24 to Nov. 27\nupdated 2 years ago\n‚Ä¢\n10 images\nTop 100 Stars of 2021\nupdated 3 years ago\n‚Ä¢\n100 people\nThe Most Anticipated Movies of 2020\nupdated 4 years ago\n‚Ä¢\n10 images\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

\"Skyfall\" and \"Casino Royale\" are highly rated James Bond films, but they are typically longer than 150 minutes.\n   - \"Logan Lucky\" and \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" are well-received films that might be shorter than 150 minutes and could be available on Netflix.\n   - \"Dream House\" is another film that might fit the criteria, given its moderate runtime and rating.\n   - \"Layer Cake\" is a critically acclaimed film and might be available on Netflix.\n   - \"The Invasion\" is a lesser-known film but could be available on Netflix due to its moderate runtime and rating.\n\n5. **NEW INFORMATION**\n   -

His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \"Ring O'Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig has English, as well as Irish, Scottish and Welsh, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964.
