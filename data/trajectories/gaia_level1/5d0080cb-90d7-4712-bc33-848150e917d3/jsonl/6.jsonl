Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request mentions a paper titled \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet\" published by the University of Leicester.\n   - The specific information requested is the volume in m³ of the fish bag calculated in the paper.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact volume in m³ of the fish bag as reported in the University of Leicester paper \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet.\"\n   - The publication date and authors of the paper for verification purposes.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: The University of Leicester's official repository or academic databases like JSTOR, Google Scholar, or the university's departmental publications page.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information. The volume of the fish bag is a direct piece of data from the paper.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The volume of the fish bag is likely to be a significant size, given that it needs to supply enough fish for a dragon's diet.\n   - The paper probably includes calculations based on the estimated size of the dragon and its dietary requirements.\n   - The volume could be in the range of several cubic meters, but this is speculative without the actual data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1**: **WebSurfer** will search for the University of Leicester paper titled \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet\" using academic databases or the University of Leicester's official repository.\n- **Step 2**: Once the paper is located, **WebSurfer** will open the paper and locate the section that discusses the volume of the fish bag.\n- **Step 3**: **WebSurfer** will extract the specific volume in m³ of the fish bag from the paper.\n- **Step 4**: **WebSurfer** will provide the extracted information back to the **Assistant**.\n- **Step 5**: **Assistant** will verify the information and format the final answer to the request."}

In the 2010 film, Toothless is struck\ndown  during  a  dragon  raid  and  loses  his  left  tail-fin,  leaving  him  trapped  in  a  sunken  area.  This  paper\ninvestigates  the  feasibility  of  Hiccup,  a  teenage  boy,  being  able  to  supply  enough  fish  to  maintain  the\ndragon’s diet by catching and bringing fish to him. It was found that in the twelve days that Toothless was\ntrapped, he would have required 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, which totalled 716 kg.\nHiccup  would  have  had  to  carry  828  fish  weighing  at  total  of  8592  kg  over  the  twelve  days,  which  is\nunrealistic since he struggles to lift a shield in combat.\n\nIntroduction\nThe  How  to  Train  Your  Dragon  franchise  is  loosely\nbased on the popular book series by Cressida Cowell\n[1]. The events take  place in  Viking  Scotland, in the\nsmall village of Berk which is repeatedly attacked by\ndragons. One of the  deadliest  dragon  species  is the\nNight Fury, which was previously unseen by any living\nperson.  It  is  described  as  the  “unholy  offspring  of\nlightning  and  death  itself”  due  to  its  speed  and\ncamouflage abilities [2]. Toothless is the only known\nNight Fury, and is shown to be intelligent and playful\nwhile also deadly.\n\nHiccup Horrendous Haddock III, the main protagonist,\nis  a  small  teenage  boy  eager  to  prove  himself  as  a\nViking. Using an invention which closely resembles a\nnet  gun,  Hiccup  strikes  down  Toothless  during  a\ndragon  raid.  Toothless’  left  caudal  fin  is  severed,\nrendering him unable to fly out of the sunken area,\nknown as The Cove [3]. Fish are a large component of\nis  exclusively\na  dragon’s  diet,  and  Toothless\ndependent  on  fish  for  nutrition  [4].  This  paper\ninvestigates  whether  Hiccup  is  able  to  maintain\nToothless’ feeding habits while he is trapped in The\nCove.\n\nAssumptions\nSeveral  assumptions  and  simplifications  must  be\nmade  to  calculate  the  required  values.  During  the\ntime  lapse  montages  in  the  film,  it  is  taken  that\n\nToothless is in The Cove for a total of twelve days [5].\nIt is assumed that Hiccup visited once a day for the\nduration of Toothless’ stay.\n\nOn  the  third  day,  Hiccup  brings  a  sack  of  fish,  and\nmentions that it contains Icelandic cod and salmon.\nThere  is  also  a  pond  in  the  clearing,  and  one  scene\nshows  Toothless  hunting  for  fish.  However,  in  this\npaper,  it  is  assumed  that  Toothless  relies  solely  on\nHiccup for nutrition. During his time in The Cove, it is\nassumed  that  his  diet  consists  of  only  salmon  and\ncod. It is also assumed that each sack contained the\nsame amount of fish, and that he received the same\namount every day for twelve days.\n\nThe sack is modelled as a cylinder, while the fish have\nbeen modelled as prolate spheroids (see Appendix for\nvisual aids).\n\nFigure 1 – Comparison of size of Hiccup to bag [5].\n\nSize of the bag\nHiccup is said to be 1.625 m tall [6], and using average\nmale  proportions,  the  bag  appears  to  be  3/8  of  his\nheight [7]. Therefore, the height of the bag,\n\n:\n\n𝐻𝐻𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏\n\n\fCan Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?
