Annotation with generated and existing long and short read RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and ATAC-seq, revealed that 32.1% of lifted over CanFam3.1 gaps harboured previously hidden functional elements, including promoters, genes and miRNAs in GSD_1.0. A catalogue of canine \"dark\" regions was made to facilitate mapping rescue. Alignment in these regions is difficult, but we demonstrate that they harbour trait-associated variation. Key genomic regions were completed, including the Dog Leucocyte Antigen (DLA), T Cell Receptor (TCR) and 366 COSMIC cancer genes. 10x linked-read sequencing of 27 dogs (19 breeds) uncovered 22.1 million SNPs, indels and larger structural variants. Subsequent intersection with protein coding genes showed that 1.4% of these could directly influence gene products, and so provide a source of normal or aberrant phenotypic modifications. \nFull text links\n[x]\n[x]\nCite\n Copy \nDownload .nbib\nFormat:\nSend To\nClipboard\nEmail\nSave\nMy Bibliography\nCollections\nCitation Manager\n[x]\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"microdata\": [\n        {\n            \"itemType\": \"http://schema.org/WebPage\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"itemType\": \"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\",\n            \"associatedMedia\": [\n                [\n                    [\n                        [\n                            {\n                                \"itemType\": \"http://schema.org/ImageObject\",\n                                \"contentUrl\": \"\",\n                                \"thumbnail\": \"https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/df74/7875987/162c3199aaad/42003_2021_1698_Fig1_HTML.gif\",\n                                \"width\": \"720\",\n                                \"height\": \"742\",\n                                \"caption\": \"Fig. 1.

From this region, three homologous chr 18 fragments spanning MAGI2 (M1, M2 and M3) were present on chr 9 of CanFam3.1, but missing in the GSD_1.0. We proposed that those homologous fragments should be located together with a duplication (DUP2, chr 9: 10.03\\u201310.16 Mb) within a large duplicated region (DUP1, chr 9: 9.07\\u201310.25 Mb). b Reads from both original and homologous M1, M2 and M3 fragments were mapped to chr 18 of GSD_1.0. c Mischka and all 10x dogs have only two original chr 18 copies M1, M2 and M3, but carry between 0 and 6 copies of the chr 9 homologous fragments. d The example plot of normalised depth illustrates how the copy number of the reference alleles and variant alleles were measured to distinguish the original (red) and homologous (blue) of M1, M2 and M3.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"itemType\": \"http://schema.org/ImageObject\",\n            \"contentUrl\": \"\",\n            \"thumbnail\": \"https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/df74/7875987/10978a6dc61a/42003_2021_1698_Fig5_HTML.gif\",\n            \"width\": \"718\",\n            \"height\": \"327\",\n            \"caption\": \"Fig. 5.

Installation pip install ncbi-genome-download                                        Alternatively, clone this repository from GitHub, then run (in a python virtual environment) pip install .                                        If this fails on older versions of Python, try updating your pip tool first: pip install --upgrade pip                                        and then rerun the ncbi-genome-download install. Alternatively, ncbi-genome-download is packaged in conda. Refer the the Anaconda/miniconda site to install a distribution (highly recommended). With that installed one can do: conda install -c bioconda ncbi-genome-download                                        ncbi-genome-download is only developed and tested on Python releases still under active support by the Python project. At the moment, this means versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11. Specifically, no attempt at testing under Python versions older than 3.7 is being made. If your system is stuck on an older version of Python, consider using a tool like Homebrew to obtain a more up-to-date version. ncbi-genome-download 0.2.12 was the last version to support Python 2. Usage To download all bacterial RefSeq genomes in GenBank format from NCBI, run the following: ncbi-genome-download bacteria                                        Downloading multiple groups is also possible: ncbi-genome-download bacteria,viral                                        Note: To see all available groups, see ncbi-genome-download --help, or simply use all to check all groups. Naming a more specific group will reduce the download size and the time needed to find the sequences to download. If you're on a reasonably fast connection, you might want to try running multiple downloads in parallel: ncbi-genome-download bacteria --parallel 4                                        To download all fungal GenBank genomes from NCBI in GenBank format, run: ncbi-genome-download --section genbank fungi                                        To download all viral RefSeq genomes in FASTA format, run: ncbi-genome-download --formats fasta viral                                        It is possible to download multiple formats by supplying a list of formats or simply downloading all formats: ncbi-genome-download --formats fasta,assembly-report viral ncbi-genome-download --formats all viral                                        To download only completed bacterial RefSeq genomes in GenBank format, run: ncbi-genome-download --assembly-levels complete bacteria                                        It is possible to download multiple assembly levels at once by supplying a list: ncbi-genome-download --assembly-levels complete,chromosome bacteria                                        To download only bacterial reference genomes from RefSeq in GenBank format, run: ncbi-genome-download --refseq-categories reference bacteria                                        To download bacterial RefSeq genomes of the genus Streptomyces, run: ncbi-genome-download --genera Streptomyces bacteria                                        Note: This is a simple string match on the organism name provided by NCBI only. You can also use this with a slight trick to download genomes of a certain species as well: ncbi-genome-download --genera \\\"Streptomyces coelicolor\\\" bacteria                                        Note: The quotes are important. Again, this is a simple string match on the organism name provided by the NCBI. Multiple genera is also possible: ncbi-genome-download --genera \\\"Streptomyces coelicolor,Escherichia coli\\\" bacteria                                        You can also put genus names into a file, one organism per line, e.g.: Streptomyces Amycolatopsis                                        Then, pass the path to that file (e.g. my_genera.txt) to the --genera option, like so: ncbi-genome-download --genera my_genera.txt bacteria                                        Note: The above command will download all Streptomyces and Amycolatopsis genomes from RefSeq. You can make the string match fuzzy using the --fuzzy-genus option. This can be handy if you need to match a value in the middle of the NCBI organism name, like so: ncbi-genome-download --genera coelicolor --fuzzy-genus bacteria                                        Note: The above command will download all bacterial genomes containing \\\"coelicolor\\\" anywhere in their organism name from RefSeq. To download bacterial RefSeq genomes based on their NCBI species taxonomy ID, run: ncbi-genome-download --species-taxids 562 bacteria                                        Note: The above command will download all RefSeq genomes belonging to Escherichia coli. To download a specific bacterial RefSeq genomes based on its NCBI taxonomy ID, run: ncbi-genome-download --taxids 511145 bacteria                                        Note: The above command will download the RefSeq genome belonging to Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655. It is also possible to download multiple species taxids or taxids by supplying the numbers in a comma-separated list: ncbi-genome-download --taxids 9606,9685 --assembly-level chromosome vertebrate_mammalian                                        Note: The above command will download the reference genomes for cat and human. In addition, you can put multiple species taxids or taxids into a file, one per line and pass that filename to the --species-taxids or --taxids parameters, respectively. Assuming you had a file my_taxids.txt with the following contents: 9606 9685                                         You could download the reference genomes for cat and human like this: ncbi-genome-download --taxids my_taxids.txt --assembly-levels chromosome vertebrate_mammalian                                        It is possible to also create a human-readable directory structure in parallel to mirroring the layout used by NCBI: ncbi-genome-download --human-readable bacteria                                        This will use links to point to the appropriate files in the NCBI directory structure, so it saves file space. Note that links are not supported on some Windows file systems and some older versions of Windows. It is also possible to re-run a previous download with the --human-readable option. In this case, ncbi-genome-download will not download any new genome files, and just create human-readable directory structure. Note that if any files have been changed on the NCBI side, a file download will be triggered. There is a \\\"dry-run\\\" option to show which accessions would be downloaded, given your filters: ncbi-genome-download --dry-run bacteria                                        If you want to filter for the \\\"relation to type material\\\" column of the assembly summary file, you can use the --type-materials option. Possible values are \\\"any\\\", \\\"all\\\", \\\"type\\\", \\\"reference\\\", \\\"synonym\\\", \\\"proxytype\\\", and/or \\\"neotype\\\". \\\"any\\\" will include assemblies with no relation to type material value defined, \\\"all\\\" will download only assemblies with a defined value. Multiple values can be given, separated by comma: ncbi-genome-download --type-materials type,reference                                        By default, ncbi-genome-download caches the assembly summary files for the respective taxonomic groups for one day. You can skip using the cache file by using the --no-cache option. The output of --help also shows the cache directory, should you want to remove any of the cached files. To get an overview of all options, run ncbi-genome-download --help                                        As a method You can also use it as a method call: import ncbi_genome_download as ngd ngd.download()                                        Pass the pythonised keyword arguments as described above or in the --help. To specify taxonomic groups, like bacteria, use the groups keyword. To specify file formats, like for the --format CLI option, use file_formats. All other keywords should match the CLI options, with - converted to _. Note that because the method call follows the same logic as the CLI, lists data should still be passed as strings, separated by a comma but no spaces, just like on the command line. Contributed Scripts: gimme_taxa.py This script lets you find out what TaxIDs to pass to ngd, and will write a simple one-item-per-line file to pass in to it. It utilises the ete3 toolkit, so refer to their site to install the dependency if it's not already satisfied. You can query the database using a particular TaxID, or a scientific name. The primary function of the script is to return all the child taxa of the specified parent taxa. The script has various options for what information is written in the output. A basic invocation may look like: # Fetch all descendent taxa for Escherichia (taxid 561): python gimme_taxa.py -o ~/mytaxafile.txt 561  # Alternatively, just provide the taxon name python gimme_taxa.py -o all_descendent_taxids.txt Escherichia  # You can provide multiple taxids and/or names python gimme_taxa.py -o all_descendent_taxids.txt 561,Methanobrevibacter                                        On first use, a small sqlite database will be created in your home directory by default (change the location with the --database flag). You can update this database by using the --update flag. Note that if the database is not in your home directory, you must specify it with --database or a new database will be created in your home directory. To see all help: python gimme_taxa.py python gimme_taxa.py -h python gimme_taxa.py --help                                        To use the gimme_taxa.py script with ncbi-genome-download's --taxids option, you need to call gimme_taxa.py with the -j option, like this: gimme_taxa.py -j -o my_taxids.txt Escherichia ncbi-genome-download --taxids my_taxids.txt bacteria                                        Citing ncbi-genome-download You can cite ncbi-genome-download via the Zenodo deposit under DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.8192432 or the specific DOI for the version you used.

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The GSD_1.0 (German Shepherd Dog) genome assembly (canFam4) was released in 2021 and is a significant improvement over CanFam3.1, with increased contiguity and fewer gaps.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The exact location or URL where these files can be accessed.\n   - These details can likely be found on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website, specifically in the Canis lupus familiaris (dog) genome assembly section.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific facts need to be derived through logical deduction, simulation, or computation based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files in May 2020 were likely part of the CanFam3.1 assembly, as GSD_1.0 (canFam4) was released in 2021.\n   - The NCBI or a similar authoritative database would host these files, as they are standard repositories for genomic data.\n   - The NCBI FTP site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) or the NCBI Datasets page might provide the most direct and reliable access to the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n   - Given the improvements in GSD_1.0, it is possible that researchers might have started transitioning to this newer version even before its official release, but the most widely used and stable version in May 2020 would still be CanFam3.1.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **CanFam3.1 in May 2020**: Since GSD_1.0 (canFam4) was released in 2021, the most relevant and widely used assembly in May 2020 would have been CanFam3.1. This version was the most recent and stable at that time.\n- **NCBI FTP and Datasets**: The NCBI FTP site and the NCBI Datasets page are known for hosting genomic data and providing direct download links. These resources are likely to have the CanFam3.1 files.\n- **Transition to GSD_1.0**: While GSD_1.0 offers significant improvements, the transition to a new assembly version typically takes time. Therefore, CanFam3.1 would still have been the primary reference in May 2020.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Access Block**: The attempts to access the NCBI FTP site and other NCBI pages resulted in an \"Access Denied\" error due to a possible misuse/abuse situation.\n2. **Incorrect Search Queries**: The search queries used to find the GSD_1.0 genome files did not yield direct download links or official documentation.\n3. **Lack of Direct Links**: The search results often led to general pages or scripts for downloading genomes, but not the specific files for the GSD_1.0 assembly.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Use Official NCBI Datasets Page**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the official NCBI Datasets page for Canis lupus familiaris (dog) genome assemblies.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the CanFam3.1 assembly, as it was the most relevant version in May 2020.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Locate and extract the direct download link for the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n\n2. **Check NCBI FTP Site via Command Line**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Use `rsync` or `wget` to access the NCBI FTP site and download the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the following command to list the files in the CanFam3.1 directory:\n     ```sh\n     wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R \"index.html*\" ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/002/285\n     ```\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Identify the specific files needed and download them.\n\n3. **Use NCBI Datasets Command Line Tools**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Install the NCBI Datasets command-line tools if not already installed.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Use the `ncbi-datasets` command to download the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n     ```sh\n     ncbi-datasets download genome --accession GCF_000002285.2 --filename canFam3.1\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for Alternative Sources**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for alternative repositories or databases that might host the CanFam3.1 assembly files, such as Ensembl or UCSC Genome Browser.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Ensembl or UCSC Genome Browser pages for the dog genome and locate the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download links for the files.\n\n5. **Document the Steps**:\n   - **Assistant**: Document the steps taken and the direct download links found to ensure the information is clear and accessible.\n\n### Summary of Steps\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the NCBI Datasets page for Canis lupus familiaris and locate the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n- **ComputerTerminal**: Use `rsync` or `wget` to list and download the CanFam3.1 files from the NCBI FTP site.\n- **ComputerTerminal**: Install and use the NCBI Datasets command-line tools to download the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n- **WebSurfer**: Check alternative repositories like Ensembl or UCSC Genome Browser for the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n- **Assistant**: Document the steps and direct download links."}

Here is the updated fact sheet, incorporating the new information and adjusting the educated guesses accordingly:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The GSD_1.0 (German Shepherd Dog) genome assembly (canFam4) was released in 2021 and is a significant improvement over CanFam3.1, with increased contiguity and fewer gaps.\n   - Access to the NCBI website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is currently blocked due to a possible misuse/abuse situation, preventing us from directly accessing the NCBI Datasets page or FTP site.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The exact location or URL where these files can be accessed.\n   - These details can likely be found on alternative authoritative databases such as Ensembl or the UCSC Genome Browser, as the NCBI website is currently inaccessible.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific facts need to be derived through logical deduction, simulation, or computation based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files in May 2020 were likely part of the CanFam3.1 assembly, as GSD_1.0 (canFam4) was released in 2021.\n   - Given the current block on the NCBI website, alternative repositories such as Ensembl (https://www.ensembl.org/Canis_lupus_familiaris/Info/Index) or the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?org=Dog) are likely to host the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n   - The Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browser websites are known for providing comprehensive and reliable genomic data, including direct download links for various assemblies.\n   - The CanFam3.1 assembly files can be found in the FTP directories of these alternative repositories, which should be accessible without the current restrictions faced with the NCBI site.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **CanFam3.1 in May 2020**: Since GSD_1.0 (canFam4) was released in 2021, the most relevant and widely used assembly in May 2020 would have been CanFam3.1. This version was the most recent and stable at that time.\n- **Alternative Repositories**: Given the current block on the NCBI website, it is reasonable to assume that other well-known and trusted genomic data repositories like Ensembl and the UCSC Genome Browser will have the necessary files. These sites are often used as secondary sources for genomic data and are less likely to face the same access restrictions.\n- **FTP Directories**: Both Ensembl and the UCSC Genome Browser provide FTP access to their genomic data, which can be a reliable method for downloading the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Access Ensembl for CanFam3.1 Assembly**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Ensembl website for Canis lupus familiaris (dog) genome assemblies.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Locate the CanFam3.1 assembly and extract the direct download links for the files.\n\n2. **Access UCSC Genome Browser for CanFam3.1 Assembly**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser website for Canis lupus familiaris (dog) genome assemblies.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Locate the CanFam3.1 assembly and extract the direct download links for the files.\n\n3. **Check FTP Directories**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Use `wget` or `rsync` to access the FTP directories of Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browser.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the following commands to list the files in the CanFam3.1 directories:\n     ```sh\n     wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R \"index.html*\" ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-104/fasta/canis_lupus_familiaris/dna/\n     wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R \"index.html*\" ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/canFam3/bigZips/\n     ```\n\n4. **Document the Steps**:\n   - **Assistant**: Document the steps taken and the direct download links found to ensure the information is clear and accessible.\n\n### Summary of Steps\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Ensembl website for Canis lupus familiaris and locate the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser website for Canis lupus familiaris and locate the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n- **ComputerTerminal**: Use `wget` or `rsync` to list and download the CanFam3.1 files from the Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browser FTP sites.\n- **Assistant**: Document the steps and direct download links.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Access Block on NCBI Website**:\n   - The NCBI website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is currently blocked due to a possible misuse/abuse situation, preventing direct access to the NCBI Datasets page and FTP site.\n\n2. **Incorrect Search Queries**:\n   - Initial search queries did not yield direct download links or official documentation for the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n\n3. **Lack of Direct Links**:\n   - The search results often led to general pages or scripts for downloading genomes, but not the specific files for the CanFam3.1 assembly.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Access Ensembl for CanFam3.1 Assembly**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Ensembl website for Canis lupus familiaris (dog) genome assemblies.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the CanFam3.1 assembly.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download links for the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n\n2. **Access UCSC Genome Browser for CanFam3.1 Assembly**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser website for Canis lupus familiaris (dog) genome assemblies.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for the CanFam3.1 assembly.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download links for the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n\n3. **Check FTP Directories via Command Line**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Use `wget` to list the files in the Ensembl FTP directory for CanFam3.1.\n     ```sh\n     wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R \"index.html*\" ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-104/fasta/canis_lupus_familiaris/dna/\n     ```\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Use `wget` to list the files in the UCSC Genome Browser FTP directory for CanFam3.1.\n     ```sh\n     wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R \"index.html*\" ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/canFam3/bigZips/\n     ```\n\n4. **Document the Steps and Links**:\n   - **Assistant**: Document the steps taken and the direct download links found to ensure the information is clear and accessible.\n\n### Summary of Steps\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Ensembl website for Canis lupus familiaris and locate the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser website for Canis lupus familiaris and locate the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n- **ComputerTerminal**: Use `wget` to list and download the CanFam3.1 files from the Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browser FTP sites.\n- **Assistant**: Document the steps and direct download links."}

As with the previous GRCh37 assembly, the \nGenome Reference Consortium (GRC) is now the primary source for human genome assembly data submitted to GenBank. Beginning with this release, the UCSC Genome Browser version numbers for the human assemblies now match those of the GRC to minimize version confusion. Hence, the GRCh38 assembly is referred to as \"hg38\" in the Genome Browser datasets and documentation. For a glossary of assembly-related terms, see the GRC \nAssembly Terminology page. \nGRCh38 HighlightsAlternate sequences - Several human chromosomal regions exhibit sufficient variability to prevent adequate representation by a single sequence. To address this, the GRCh38 assembly provides alternate sequence for selected variant regions through the inclusion of \nalternate loci scaffolds (or \nalt loci). Alt loci are separate accessioned sequences that are aligned to reference chromosomes. The GRCh38 initial assembly contained 261 alt loci, many of which are associated with the LRC/KIR area of chr19 and the MHC region on chr6. Subsequent GRC patch releases have added additional alt loci and fix patches. See the \nsequences page for the latest list of the reference chromosomes, alternate, and patch sequences in GRCh38. \nFix sequences - Fix patches denoted by \nchr__fix represent changes to the existing sequence. These are generally error corrections (such as base changes, component replacements/updates, switch point updates or tiling path changes) or assembly improvements (such as extension of sequence into gaps). These fix patch scaffold sequences are given chromosome context through alignments to the corresponding chromosome regions. A list of all chromosomes including \nchr_fix sequences can be found in the \nsequences page. \nCentromere representation - Debuting in this release, the large megabase-sized gaps that represented centromeric regions in previous assemblies have been replaced by sequences from centromere models created by \nKaren Miga et al., using centromere databases developed during her work in the Willard lab at Duke University (now at the \nUniversity of Chicago) and analysis software developed while working in the \nKent lab at UCSC. The models, which provide the approximate repeat number and order for each centromere, will be useful for read mapping and variation studies. \nMitochondrial genome - The mitochondrial reference sequence included in the GRCh38 assembly (termed \"chrM\" in the UCSC Genome Browser) is the \nRevised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) from \nMITOMAP with GenBank accession number J01415.2 and RefSeq accession number NC_012920.1. This differs from the chrM sequence (RefSeq accession number NC_001807) provided by the Genome Browser for hg19, which was not updated when the GRCh37 assembly later transitioned to the new version. \nSequence updates - Several erroneous bases and misassembled regions in GRCh37 have been corrected in the GRCh38 assembly, and more than 100 gaps have been filled or reduced. Much of the data used to improve the reference sequence was obtained from other genome sequencing and analysis projects, such as the \n1000 Genomes Project. \nAnalysis set - The GRCh38 assembly offers an \"analysis set\" that was created to accommodate next generation sequencing read alignment pipelines. To avoid false mapping of reads, duplicate copies of centromeric arrays and WGS on several chromosomes have been hard-masked with Ns. The two PAR regions on chromosome Y have also been hard-masked, and the Epstein-Barr virus sequence has been added as a decoy to attract contamination in samples. Two versions of the analysis set are available on our \ndownloads page: one without the alternate chromosomes from this assembly, and one that includes them. \nChromosome naming conventions UCSC has introduced some slight changes to the Genome Browser chromosome naming scheme with this release: \nHaplotype chromosome, unplaced contig and unlocalized contig names now include their NCBI accession number (e.g., chr6_GL000256v2_alt)\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nThe dog genome was first mapped in 2004 and has been updated several times since. What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Let's update the fact sheet to reflect the current state of our efforts and any new insights we've gained.\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the files that were most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The GSD_1.0 (German Shepherd Dog) genome assembly (canFam4) was released in 2021 and is a significant improvement over CanFam3.1, with increased contiguity and fewer gaps.\n   - Access to the NCBI website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is currently blocked due to a possible misuse/abuse situation, preventing us from directly accessing the NCBI Datasets page or FTP site.\n   - The Ensembl website (https://www.ensembl.org/Canis_lupus_familiaris/Info/Index) provides access to multiple genome assemblies, including CanFam3.1.\n   - The UCSC Genome Browser website (https://genome.ucsc.edu/) is another authoritative source for genomic data, including the CanFam3.1 assembly.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The exact location or URL where these files can be accessed.\n   - These details can likely be found on the Ensembl or UCSC Genome Browser websites, as the NCBI website is currently inaccessible.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific facts need to be derived through logical deduction, simulation, or computation based on the given information.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files in May 2020 were likely part of the CanFam3.1 assembly, as GSD_1.0 (canFam4) was released in 2021.\n   - Given the current block on the NCBI website, alternative repositories such as Ensembl (https://www.ensembl.org/Canis_lupus_familiaris/Info/Index) or the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/) are likely to host the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n   - The Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browser websites are known for providing comprehensive and reliable genomic data, including direct download links for various assemblies.\n   - The CanFam3.1 assembly files can be found in the FTP directories of these alternative repositories, which should be accessible without the current restrictions faced with the NCBI site.\n\n**New Educated Guesses and Hunches:**\n   - **UCSC Genome Browser**: The UCSC Genome Browser is a robust resource for genomic data and is likely to have a dedicated section for downloading the CanFam3.1 assembly files. This section is typically found under the 'Downloads' or 'Files' tab on the species-specific page.\n   - **Ensembl FTP Directory**: The Ensembl FTP directory for CanFam3.1 is likely to contain the necessary files in the `/pub/release-104/fasta/canis_lupus_familiaris/dna/` directory. This is a common structure for Ensembl FTP directories.\n   - **UCSC FTP Directory**: The UCSC FTP directory for CanFam3.1 is likely to contain the necessary files in the `/goldenPath/canFam3/bigZips/` directory. This is a common structure for UCSC FTP directories.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **CanFam3.1 in May 2020**: Since GSD_1.0 (canFam4) was released in 2021, the most relevant and widely used assembly in May 2020 would have been CanFam3.1. This version was the most recent and stable at that time.\n- **Alternative Repositories**: Given the current block on the NCBI website, it is reasonable to assume that other well-known and trusted genomic data repositories like Ensembl and the UCSC Genome Browser will have the necessary files. These sites are often used as secondary sources for genomic data and are less likely to face the same access restrictions.\n- **FTP Directories**: Both Ensembl and the UCSC Genome Browser provide FTP access to their genomic data, which can be a reliable method for downloading the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Access Ensembl for CanFam3.1 Assembly**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Ensembl website for Canis lupus familiaris (https://www.ensembl.org/Canis_lupus_familiaris/Info/Index).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the \"Other reference assemblies\" section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"CanFam3.1 (Ensembl release 104)\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download links for the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n\n2. **Access UCSC Genome Browser for CanFam3.1 Assembly**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser website (https://genome.ucsc.edu/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Genomes\" in the top menu.\n   - **WebSurfer**: In the \"Mammals\" section, find and click on \"Dog (Canis lupus familiaris)\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: On the Dog genome page, locate and click on \"CanFam3.1\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download links for the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n\n3. **Check FTP Directories**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Use `wget` to list the files in the CanFam3.1 directories from the Ensembl FTP site.\n     ```sh\n     wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R \"index.html*\" ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-104/fasta/canis_lupus_familiaris/dna/\n     ```\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Use `wget` to list the files in the CanFam3.1 directories from the UCSC FTP site.\n     ```sh\n     wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R \"index.html*\" ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/canFam3/bigZips/\n     ```\n\n4. **Document the Steps**:\n   - **Assistant**: Document the steps taken and the direct download links found to ensure the information is clear and accessible.\n\n### Summary of Steps\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Ensembl website for Canis lupus familiaris and locate the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser website for Canis lupus familiaris and locate the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n- **ComputerTerminal**: Use `wget` to list the files in the CanFam3.1 directories from the Ensembl and UCSC FTP sites.\n- **Assistant**: Document the steps and direct download links found.\n\n### Action Items\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Ensembl website for Canis lupus familiaris and click on the \"Other reference assemblies\" section to select CanFam3.1.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser website for Canis lupus familiaris, click on \"Genomes\", find and click on \"Dog (Canis lupus familiaris)\", and then click on \"CanFam3.1\".\n3. **ComputerTerminal**: Use the provided `wget` commands to list the files in the CanFam3.1 directories from the Ensembl and UCSC FTP sites.\n4. **Assistant**: Document the steps and direct download links found.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps:\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Ensembl website for Canis lupus familiaris and click on the \"Other reference assemblies\" section to select CanFam3.1.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser website for Canis lupus familiaris and search for the CanFam3.1 assembly.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation on Ensembl**:\n   - Despite navigating to the Ensembl website, the WebSurfer did not successfully locate and click on the CanFam3.1 assembly link. The focus remained on the main page, and the \"Other reference assemblies\" section was not explored properly.\n\n2. **Incorrect Navigation on UCSC**:\n   - The WebSurfer navigated to the UCSC Genome Browser homepage but did not correctly identify and click on the 'Dog (Canis lupus familiaris)' link in the 'Popular Species' section. Instead, it navigated to a different page, leading to confusion and incorrect actions.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Access Ensembl for CanFam3.1 Assembly**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Ensembl website for Canis lupus familiaris (https://www.ensembl.org/Canis_lupus_familiaris/Info/Index).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the \"Other reference assemblies\" section.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"CanFam3.1 (Ensembl release 104)\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download links for the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n\n2. **Access UCSC Genome Browser for CanFam3.1 Assembly**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser website (https://genome.ucsc.edu/).\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on \"Genomes\" in the top menu.\n   - **WebSurfer**: In the \"Mammals\" section, find and click on \"Dog (Canis lupus familiaris)\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: On the Dog genome page, locate and click on \"CanFam3.1\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the direct download links for the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n\n3. **Check FTP Directories**:\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Use `wget` to list the files in the CanFam3.1 directories from the Ensembl FTP site.\n     ```sh\n     wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R \"index.html*\" ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-104/fasta/canis_lupus_familiaris/dna/\n     ```\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: Use `wget` to list the files in the CanFam3.1 directories from the UCSC FTP site.\n     ```sh\n     wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R \"index.html*\" ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/canFam3/bigZips/\n     ```\n\n4. **Document the Steps**:\n   - **Assistant**: Document the steps taken and the direct download links found to ensure the information is clear and accessible.\n\n### Action Items\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the Ensembl website for Canis lupus familiaris and click on the \"Other reference assemblies\" section to select CanFam3.1.\n- **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the UCSC Genome Browser website for Canis lupus familiaris, click on \"Genomes\", find and click on \"Dog (Canis lupus familiaris)\", and then click on \"CanFam3.1\".\n- **ComputerTerminal**: Use the provided `wget` commands to list the files in the CanFam3.1 directories from the Ensembl and UCSC FTP sites.\n- **Assistant**: Document the steps and direct download links found.\n\n### Detailed Instructions for WebSurfer\n\n1. **Ensembl**:\n   - Navigate to https://www.ensembl.org/Canis_lupus_familiaris/Info/Index.\n   - Scroll down to the \"Other reference assemblies\" section.\n   - Click on \"CanFam3.1 (Ensembl release 104)\".\n   - Extract the direct download links for the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n\n2. **UCSC**:\n   - Navigate to https://genome.ucsc.edu/.\n   - Click on \"Genomes\" in the top menu.\n   - In the \"Mammals\" section, find and click on \"Dog (Canis lupus familiaris)\".\n   - On the Dog genome page, locate and click on \"CanFam3.1\".\n   - Extract the direct download links for the CanFam3.1 assembly files.\n\n### Detailed Instructions for ComputerTerminal\n\n1. **Ensembl FTP**:\n   - Run the following command to list the files in the CanFam3.1 directories from the Ensembl FTP site:\n     ```sh\n     wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R \"index.html*\" ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-104/fasta/canis_lupus_familiaris/dna/\n     ```\n\n2. **UCSC FTP**:\n   - Run the following command to list the files in the CanFam3.1 directories from the UCSC FTP site:\n     ```sh\n     wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R \"index.html*\" ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/canFam3/bigZips/\n     ```\n\n### Final Step\n\n- **Assistant**: Document the steps taken and the direct download links found to ensure the information is clear and accessible."}
