It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking about the US version of Survivor.\n   - The winner must have been born in the month of May.\n   - The information is as of August 2023.\n   - The Famous Birthdays website provides a list of US Survivor winners, but it does not directly list their birth months.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The birth months of all the winners of the US version of Survivor.\n   - This information can be found on official Survivor websites, fan sites, and possibly Wikipedia pages dedicated to Survivor contestants and winners.\n   - Individual Wikipedia pages for each Survivor winner might contain their birth dates.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information. Once the birth months are known, it will be straightforward to identify the winner(s) born in May.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the number of seasons and the diverse backgrounds of the winners, it is highly likely that at least one winner was born in May.\n   - One potential candidate is **Earl Cole**, who won Season 14: Fiji. His birth month is often mentioned in trivia and fan discussions, and he is a well-known figure in the Survivor community. Checking his birth month could be a good starting point.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the individual Wikipedia pages for each Survivor winner to extract their birth dates.\n- **WebSurfer**: Start with Earl Cole's Wikipedia page to check his birth month.\n- **WebSurfer**: Continue checking the birth months of other winners until the one born in May is identified.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Inefficient Data Extraction**: The initial approach involved scrolling through the Famous Birthdays page, which did not provide the birth months of the winners directly. This led to a lot of time spent without obtaining the necessary information.\n- **Lack of Direct Source**: The Famous Birthdays page was not the most efficient source for extracting the birth months of the winners. We should have directly accessed individual Wikipedia pages or another reliable source that lists the birth dates of the winners.\n- **Insufficient Focus on Key Information**: The focus should have been on finding a direct source of birth dates rather than relying on a page that did not provide this information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Conduct a web search to find a reliable source that lists the birth dates of all US Survivor winners.\n2. **WebSurfer**: Visit the Wikipedia page for each US Survivor winner to extract their birth dates.\n3. **WebSurfer**: Compile a list of all US Survivor winners and their birth months.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Identify the winner(s) born in May.\n5. **Assistant**: Verify the information and format the final answer.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1**: Conduct a web search for a comprehensive list of US Survivor winners and their birth dates.\n  - **Query**: \"US Survivor winners birth dates\"\n  - **Expected Result**: Find a reliable source such as Wikipedia or a dedicated fan site.\n\n- **Step 2**: Visit the Wikipedia page for each US Survivor winner.\n  - **Action**: Navigate to the Wikipedia page for each winner and extract their birth date.\n  - **Example**: Search for \"Richard Hatch\" on Wikipedia and note his birth date.\n\n- **Step 3**: Compile a list of all US Survivor winners and their birth months.\n  - **Action**: Create a list with the names and birth months of all winners.\n\n- **Step 4**: Identify the winner(s) born in May.\n  - **Action**: Filter the list to find the winner(s) born in May.\n\n- **Step 5**: Verify the information and format the final answer.\n  - **Action**: Double-check the birth month of the identified winner and provide the final answer.\n\n### Example of Initial Web Search\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for \"US Survivor winners birth dates\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Open the first reliable link, such as the Wikipedia page for Survivor winners.\n- **WebSurfer**: Extract the birth dates from the Wikipedia page for each winner.\n\n### Example of Extracting Birth Dates\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the Wikipedia page for Richard Hatch.\n- **WebSurfer**: Note his birth date (e.g., May 6, 1965).\n- **WebSurfer**: Repeat for all other winners.\n\n### Final Verification\n\n- **Assistant**: Compile the list and identify the winner born in May.\n- **Assistant**: Format the final answer.\n\nThis plan ensures that we directly access the necessary information and avoid the inefficiencies of the previous approach."}

The American series premiered on May 31, 2000, on \nCBS. It is hosted by \nJeff Probst, who is also an \nexecutive producer along with \nMark Burnett and the original creator, Parsons. \nSurvivor places a group of people in an isolated location, where they must provide food, fire, and shelter for themselves. The contestants compete in challenges including testing the contestants' physical abilities like running and swimming or their mental abilities like puzzles and endurance challenges for rewards and \nimmunity from elimination. The contestants are progressively eliminated from the game as they are voted out by their fellow contestants until only two or three remain. At that point, the contestants who were eliminated vote for the winner. They are given the title of \"Sole Survivor\" and are awarded the grand prize of $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 in \nWinners at War). \nThe American version has been very successful. From the \n2000–01 through the \n2005–06 television seasons, its first 11 seasons (competitions) rated among the top 10 most-watched shows. It is commonly considered the leader of American \nreality TV because it was the first \nhighly rated and profitable reality show on \nbroadcast television in the U.S., and is considered one of the best shows of the 2000s (decade).\n[1][2][3] The series has been nominated for 63 \nEmmy Awards, including winning for Outstanding Sound Mixing in 2001, Outstanding Special Class Program in 2002, and was subsequently nominated four times for \nOutstanding Reality-Competition Program when the category was introduced in 2003. Probst won the award for \nOutstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Survivor (American TV series)\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series)\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q28856068\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q28856068\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2007-11-16T16:45:01Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-11T12:12:19Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/400px-Survivor.borneo.logo.png\",\n        \"headline\": \"American version of the international Survivor reality competition television franchise\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/400px-Survivor.borneo.logo.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"400\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Survivor (American TV series) - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Contestants are referred to as \"castaways\", and they compete against one another to become the \"Sole Survivor\" and win one million \nU.S. dollars. First airing in 2000, there currently have been a total of 48 seasons aired. The program itself has been filmed on five continents. \nContestants usually apply to be on the show, but the series has been known to recruit contestants for various seasons. For \nSurvivor: Fiji, the producers had hoped to have a more racially diverse cast, and hoped that a more diverse group would apply after the success of the racially segregated \nSurvivor: Cook Islands. When this did not happen, the producers turned to recruiting and in the end, only one contestant had actually submitted an application to be on the show.\n[1] For the most part, contestants are virtually unknown prior to their \nSurvivor appearance, but occasionally some well-known people are cast. \nA total of 733 participants (castaways) have competed so far (as of \nSurvivor 48). 104 of those participants have competed in multiple seasons: 75 of them have competed in two seasons, 23 have competed in three seasons, six have competed in four seasons, and \nRob Mariano has competed in five seasons of the show. Fifteen seasons have featured or will feature returning players: five with all-returnees (\nSurvivor: All-Stars in 2004, \nSurvivor: Heroes vs. Villains in 2010,\n[2] \nSurvivor: Cambodia in 2015, \nSurvivor: Game Changers in 2017, \nSurvivor: Winners at War in 2020 and the upcoming \nSurvivor 50[3]),\n[4]six with one to four returning players on tribes with new players (\nSurvivor: Guatemala in 2005, \nSurvivor: Redemption Island and \nSurvivor: South Pacific in 2011,\n[5][6] \nSurvivor: Philippines in 2012, \nSurvivor: Edge of Extinction in 2019 and \nSurvivor 45 in 2023),\n[7] two with a tribe of ten returning \"Favorites\" facing off against a tribe of ten \"Fans\" (\nSurvivor: Micronesia in 2008 and \nSurvivor: Caramoan in 2013), and one featuring a tribe of ten returning players playing against a tribe of their family members (\nSurvivor: Blood vs. Water in 2013). Additionally, five contestants (Russell Hantz, Sandra Diaz-Twine, Cirie Fields, Parvati Shallow, Tony Vlachos) have competed on international editions of the series (namily, \nAustralian Survivor, with Fields, Shallow and Vlachos competing on the international cross-over season, \nAustralian Survivor: Australia V The World) \nOn two occasions, contestants have been cast but ultimately withdrew before the game began without being replaced: a 20th contestant, model agency owner Mellisa McNulty, was originally cast in \nSurvivor: Fiji, but dropped out and returned home the night before the show began because of panic attacks,\n[8] while in \nSurvivor: San Juan del Sur, the 19th and 20th contestants, sisters So and Doo Kim, were removed just before filming due to a medical emergency.\n[9] So would later appear on the following season \nSurvivor: Worlds Apart. \nFiji and \nSan Juan del Sur proceeded with an uneven gender balance. But because \nFiji had only one player withdraw, it is the only season in the history of the show to start with an odd number of players.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"List of Survivor (American TV series) contestants\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Survivor_(American_TV_series)_contestants\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6598744\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6598744\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2007-06-15T23:09:24Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-06-29T17:03:41Z\",\n        \"headline\": \"Wikimedia list article\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"List of Survivor (American TV series) contestants - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAs of August 2023, who is the only winner of the US version of Survivor to be born in the month of May?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and a revised plan:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking about the US version of Survivor.\n   - The winner must have been born in the month of May.\n   - The information is as of August 2023.\n   - The Famous Birthdays website provides a list of US Survivor winners, but it does not directly list their birth months.\n   - Initial web searches have not provided a comprehensive list of birth dates for all US Survivor winners.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The birth months of all the winners of the US version of Survivor.\n   - This information can be found on official Survivor websites, fan sites, and possibly Wikipedia pages dedicated to Survivor contestants and winners.\n   - Individual Wikipedia pages for each Survivor winner might contain their birth dates.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given information. Once the birth months are known, it will be straightforward to identify the winner(s) born in May.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the number of seasons and the diverse backgrounds of the winners, it is highly likely that at least one winner was born in May.\n   - One potential candidate is **Earl Cole**, who won Season 14: Fiji. His birth month is often mentioned in trivia and fan discussions, and he is a well-known figure in the Survivor community. Checking his birth month could be a good starting point.\n   - Another potential candidate is **Parvati Shallow**, who has won multiple seasons and is a prominent figure in the Survivor community. Her birth month is also worth checking.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Visit the individual Wikipedia pages for each Survivor winner to extract their birth dates.\n   - **Start with Earl Cole's Wikipedia page** to check his birth month.\n   - **Check Parvati Shallow's Wikipedia page** to verify her birth month.\n   - **Continue checking the birth months of other winners** until the one born in May is identified.\n\n2. **WebSurfer**: If Wikipedia pages do not provide the necessary information, visit fan sites and other reliable sources that might list the birth dates of Survivor winners.\n\n3. **WebSurfer**: Compile a list of all US Survivor winners and their birth months.\n4. **WebSurfer**: Identify the winner(s) born in May.\n5. **Assistant**: Verify the information and format the final answer.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1**: Visit the Wikipedia page for Earl Cole.\n  - **Action**: Search for \"Earl Cole Survivor\" on Wikipedia and note his birth date.\n  - **Expected Result**: Extract Earl Cole's birth date.\n\n- **Step 2**: Visit the Wikipedia page for Parvati Shallow.\n  - **Action**: Search for \"Parvati Shallow Survivor\" on Wikipedia and note her birth date.\n  - **Expected Result**: Extract Parvati Shallow's birth date.\n\n- **Step 3**: Continue visiting the Wikipedia pages for other US Survivor winners.\n  - **Action**: Navigate to the Wikipedia page for each winner and extract their birth dates.\n  - **Example**: Search for \"Richard Hatch Survivor\" on Wikipedia and note his birth date.\n\n- **Step 4**: Compile a list of all US Survivor winners and their birth months.\n  - **Action**: Create a list with the names and birth months of all winners.\n\n- **Step 5**: Identify the winner(s) born in May.\n  - **Action**: Filter the list to find the winner(s) born in May.\n\n- **Step 6**: Verify the information and format the final answer.\n  - **Action**: Double-check the birth month of the identified winner and provide the final answer.\n\n### Example of Initial Web Search\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Earl Cole Survivor\" on Wikipedia.\n- **WebSurfer**: Note his birth date (e.g., May 15, 1979).\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Parvati Shallow Survivor\" on Wikipedia.\n- **WebSurfer**: Note her birth date (e.g., May 23, 1982).\n\n### Final Verification\n\n- **Assistant**: Compile the list and identify the winner born in May.\n- **Assistant**: Format the final answer.\n\nThis plan ensures that we directly access the necessary information and avoid the inefficiencies of the previous approach. Let's start with Earl Cole's and Parvati Shallow's Wikipedia pages to check their birth months.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: The initial attempts to navigate through the Wikipedia page for the list of Survivor contestants did not lead to the specific section listing the winners and their birth dates.\n- **Lack of Direct Source**: The search for a comprehensive list of birth dates on the Famous Birthdays website and other search results did not provide the necessary information.\n- **Incomplete Search Strategy**: The search strategy did not systematically cover all possible sources, leading to missed opportunities to find the required information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: Perform a focused web search for a reliable source that lists the birth dates of all US Survivor winners.\n   - **Query**: \"US Survivor winners birth dates\"\n   - **Expected Result**: Find a reliable source such as a dedicated fan site or a comprehensive list on a reputable platform.\n\n2. **WebSurfer**: Visit the Wikipedia page for each US Survivor winner to extract their birth dates.\n   - **Action**: Search for each winner's name followed by \"Survivor\" on Wikipedia (e.g., \"Earl Cole Survivor\").\n   - **Example**: Search for \"Earl Cole Survivor\" and note his birth date.\n\n3. **WebSurfer**: Compile a list of all US Survivor winners and their birth months.\n   - **Action**: Create a list with the names and birth months of all winners.\n\n4. **WebSurfer**: Identify the winner(s) born in May.\n   - **Action**: Filter the list to find the winner(s) born in May.\n\n5. **Assistant**: Verify the information and format the final answer.\n   - **Action**: Double-check the birth month of the identified winner and provide the final answer.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1**: Perform a focused web search for a reliable source.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"US Survivor winners birth dates\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Open the first reliable link, such as a dedicated fan site or a comprehensive list on a reputable platform.\n\n- **Step 2**: Visit the Wikipedia page for each US Survivor winner.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Earl Cole Survivor\" on Wikipedia and note his birth date.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Parvati Shallow Survivor\" on Wikipedia and note her birth date.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Continue searching for other winners (e.g., \"Richard Hatch Survivor\", \"Tina Wesson Survivor\").\n\n- **Step 3**: Compile a list of all US Survivor winners and their birth months.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Create a list with the names and birth months of all winners.\n\n- **Step 4**: Identify the winner(s) born in May.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Filter the list to find the winner(s) born in May.\n\n- **Step 5**: Verify the information and format the final answer.\n  - **Assistant**: Double-check the birth month of the identified winner and provide the final answer.\n\n### Example of Initial Web Search\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for \"US Survivor winners birth dates\".\n- **WebSurfer**: Open the first reliable link, such as a dedicated fan site or a comprehensive list on a reputable platform.\n\n### Example of Extracting Birth Dates\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the Wikipedia page for Earl Cole.\n- **WebSurfer**: Note his birth date (e.g., May 15, 1979).\n- **WebSurfer**: Visit the Wikipedia page for Parvati Shallow.\n- **WebSurfer**: Note her birth date (e.g., May 23, 1982).\n\n### Final Verification\n\n- **Assistant**: Compile the list and identify the winner born in May.\n- **Assistant**: Format the final answer.\n\nThis plan ensures a systematic and focused approach to finding the necessary information, avoiding the inefficiencies of the previous attempts."}

The season was filmed in the \nFiji Islands from October 30 until December 7, 2006, and aired from February 8, 2007, until the two-hour season finale on May 13, 2007, followed by a live reunion from \nEd Sullivan Theater in \nNew York City, where Earl Cole was named the Sole Survivor over Andria \"Dreamz\" Herd and Cassandra Franklin in the first unanimous vote of the show's history. \nThis is, to date, the only season of \nSurvivor to have an odd number of castaways, with 19, after a 20th castaway, Mellisa McNulty, withdrew the night before filming began.\n[1][2] Due to the timing and lack of alternates, her spot could not be replaced.\n[3] Gary Stritesky was the only contestant who applied to be on the show; McNulty and the other 18 contestants were recruited.\n[4] The cast maintained a similarly racially diverse cast (with the intended 20 person cast containing equal amounts of \nAfrican American, \nAsian American, \nHispanic American, and \nEuropean American castaways) as \nSurvivor: Cook Islands, in a conscious effort intended to show that the racial diversity of \nSurvivor: Cook Islands was not just a ratings stunt.\n[3]Overview[edit]Gameplay[edit]This season introduced the \"Haves vs. Have Nots\" twist, regarded as one of the worst twists in \nSurvivor history.\n[citation needed] At the start of the season, the 19 castaways lived on a single beach and built a furnished camp, including shelters built from pre-cut wood, a kitchen area with dishware, a shower, a toilet, furniture, and the means to maintain fire, with supplies provided by the production. When the castaways were divided into two tribes, the winning tribe, Moto, won the furnished camp while the losing tribe, Ravu, had to build a new camp from scratch, and given merely a pot and a machete to survive.

During the broadcast of the season, host Jeff Probst admitted that this concept did not play out quite as the producers hoped, as it led to the \"haves\" tribe predictably dominating in the challenges over the \"have-nots\" week after week.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"Article\",\n        \"name\": \"Survivor: Fiji\",\n        \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor:_Fiji\",\n        \"sameAs\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3495121\",\n        \"mainEntity\": \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3495121\",\n        \"author\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Contributors to Wikimedia projects\"\n        },\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\",\n            \"logo\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.wikimedia.org/static/images/wmf-hor-googpub.png\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"datePublished\": \"2006-04-17T16:03:15Z\",\n        \"dateModified\": \"2025-07-08T23:50:29Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Survivor_fiji_fourteenth_season_region_1_dvd.png\",\n        \"headline\": \"season of television series\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"ResourceLoaderDynamicStyles\": \"\",\n        \"generator\": \"MediaWiki 1.45.0-wmf.9\",\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"robots\": \"max-image-preview:standard\",\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\n        \"og:image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Survivor_fiji_fourteenth_season_region_1_dvd.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"640\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"914\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=1120\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Survivor: Fiji - Wikipedia\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
