I have everything I need for the crust, but I'm not sure about the filling. I got the recipe from my friend Aditi, but she left it as a voice memo and the speaker on my phone is buzzing so I can't quite make out what she's saying. Could you please listen to the recipe and list all of the ingredients that my friend described? I only want the ingredients for the filling, as I have everything I need to make my favorite pie crust. I've attached the recipe as Strawberry pie.mp3.\n\nIn your response, please only list the ingredients, not any measurements. So if the recipe calls for \"a pinch of salt\" or \"two cups of ripe strawberries\" the ingredients on the list would be \"salt\" and \"ripe strawberries\".\n\nPlease format your response as a comma separated list of ingredients. Also, please alphabetize the ingredients. Please solve the problem carefully.The attached file path is: ../2023/validation/99c9cc74-fdc8-46c6-8f8d-3ce2d3bfeea3.mp3.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nListen to the provided audio file ../2023/validation/99c9cc74-fdc8-46c6-8f8d-3ce2d3bfeea3.mp3 and list all of the ingredients mentioned for the pie filling.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The audio transcription expert will transcribe the audio file to text.\n2. The culinary expert will identify and list the ingredients for the pie filling from the transcription.\n3. The checker will verify the accuracy of the transcription and the final list of ingredients.\n\n## Output format\nList of ingredients in a comma-separated format, alphabetized.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Only list the ingredients for the pie filling.\n- Do not include any measurements.\n- Alphabetize the ingredients.\n\n## Results from last response\nThe transcription script using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API was executed successfully."}
