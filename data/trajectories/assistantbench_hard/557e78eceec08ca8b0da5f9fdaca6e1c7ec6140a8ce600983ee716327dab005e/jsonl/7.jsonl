{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich bar is closest to Mummers Museum in Philadelphia and is wheel chair accessible?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a bar closest to the Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n   - The bar must be wheelchair accessible.\n   - The Mummers Museum is located at 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of bars near the Mummers Museum.\n   - Information on the wheelchair accessibility of these bars.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Google Maps for locations and accessibility information; local tourism websites or Yelp for reviews and accessibility details.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The distance between the Mummers Museum and the nearest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n   - The relative proximity of each bar to the Mummers Museum.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Mummers Museum is located in a part of Philadelphia that has several bars nearby, given its cultural significance and the surrounding area.\n   - Popular tourist areas in Philadelphia often have multiple venues that cater to accessibility needs.\n   - Based on the search results, some of the bars near the Mummers Museum include:\n     - **The Pub on Passyunk East** (1501 E Passyunk Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19147)\n     - **Dirty Franks** (1212 S 11th St, Philadelphia, PA 19147)\n     - **Milkboy Coffee** (Exact location needs verification)\n     - **Varga Bar & Restaurant** (Exact location needs verification)\n     - **Alma de Cuba** (1623 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19103)\n\n5. **NEW INFORMATION**\n   - The distance from the Mummers Museum to The Pub on Passyunk East is approximately 1.1 miles (7 minutes by car).\n   - The distance from the Mummers Museum to Dirty Franks is approximately 0.9 miles (18 minutes by car).\n\n6. **NEXT STEPS**\n   - Verify the exact locations and wheelchair accessibility of Milkboy Coffee, Varga Bar & Restaurant, and Alma de Cuba.\n   - Check the wheelchair accessibility of The Pub on Passyunk East and Dirty Franks.\n   - Determine the exact distances from the Mummers Museum to these bars and compare them to find the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n\nBy focusing on these next steps, we can narrow down the list and identify the closest wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Search Process**: The search process for the distances and accessibility information was not streamlined. We repeatedly searched for the same information without consolidating the findings.\n2. **Lack of Clear Tracking**: We did not keep a clear record of the distances and accessibility status of each bar, leading to redundant searches and confusion.\n3. **Incomplete Verification**: We did not fully verify the wheelchair accessibility of the bars, which is a critical requirement of the task.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Consolidate Bar List**: Create a consolidated list of bars near the Mummers Museum with their addresses.\n2. **Verify Accessibility**: For each bar on the list, verify its wheelchair accessibility using web searches and reviews.\n3. **Calculate Distances**: Use Google Maps to calculate the exact distances from the Mummers Museum to each wheelchair-accessible bar.\n4. **Record Findings**: Keep a clear record of the distances and accessibility status of each bar.\n5. **Identify Closest Bar**: Determine the closest wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum based on the recorded data.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Consolidate Bar List**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for a list of bars near the Mummers Museum (1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147) and compile their addresses.\n   - **Record**: Create a list of bars with their addresses.\n\n2. **Verify Accessibility**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each bar on the list, search for information on wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **Record**: Note whether each bar is wheelchair accessible.\n\n3. **Calculate Distances**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to calculate the distance from the Mummers Museum to each wheelchair-accessible bar.\n   - **Record**: Note the distance for each bar.\n\n4. **Record Findings**\n   - **FileSurfer**: Create a file to record the distances and accessibility status of each bar.\n   - **Format**: Include the bar name, address, wheelchair accessibility status, and distance from the Mummers Museum.\n\n5. **Identify Closest Bar**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the recorded data to determine the closest wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum.\n   - **Final Answer**: Provide the name and address of the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n\n### Example Script\n\n```python\n# Example Python script to record findings\nimport csv\n\n# List of bars with their addresses\nbars = [\n    {\"name\": \"The Pub on Passyunk East\", \"address\": \"1501 E Passyunk Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19147\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Dirty Franks\", \"address\": \"1212 S 11th St, Philadelphia, PA 19147\"},\n    # Add more bars as needed\n]\n\n# Function to record findings\ndef record_findings(bars, filename):\n    with open(filename, mode='w', newline='') as file:\n        writer = csv.writer(file)\n        writer.writerow([\"Name\", \"Address\", \"Wheelchair Accessible\", \"Distance (miles)\"])\n        for bar in bars:\n            writer.writerow([bar[\"name\"], bar[\"address\"], bar.get(\"accessible\", \"Unknown\"), bar.get(\"distance\", \"Unknown\")])\n\n# Record initial findings\nrecord_findings(bars, \"bar_distances.csv\")\n```\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Use Google Maps API**: If necessary, consider using the Google Maps API to automate distance calculations.\n- **Check Multiple Sources**: Use multiple sources (Google Maps, Yelp, and local tourism websites) to verify wheelchair accessibility.\n- **Keep Track of Progress**: Regularly update the record file to avoid redundant searches and ensure accuracy."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich bar is closest to Mummers Museum in Philadelphia and is wheel chair accessible?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a bar closest to the Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n   - The bar must be wheelchair accessible.\n   - The Mummers Museum is located at 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n   - **The Pub on Passyunk East** is located at 1501 E Passyunk Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n   - **Dirty Franks** is located at 1212 S 11th St, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n   - **Milkboy Coffee** is located at 1100 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19107.\n   - **Varga Bar & Restaurant** is located at 941 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19107.\n   - **Alma de Cuba** is located at 1623 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19103.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Information on the wheelchair accessibility of The Pub on Passyunk East, Dirty Franks, Milkboy Coffee, Varga Bar & Restaurant, and Alma de Cuba.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Google Maps for locations and accessibility information; local tourism websites or Yelp for reviews and accessibility details.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The distance between the Mummers Museum and the nearest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n   - The relative proximity of each bar to the Mummers Museum.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Mummers Museum is located in a part of Philadelphia that has several bars nearby, given its cultural significance and the surrounding area.\n   - Popular tourist areas in Philadelphia often have multiple venues that cater to accessibility needs.\n   - Based on the search results, some of the bars near the Mummers Museum include:\n     - **The Pub on Passyunk East** (1501 E Passyunk Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19147)\n     - **Dirty Franks** (1212 S 11th St, Philadelphia, PA 19147)\n     - **Milkboy Coffee** (1100 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19107)\n     - **Varga Bar & Restaurant** (941 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19107)\n     - **Alma de Cuba** (1623 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19103)\n\n5. **NEW INFORMATION**\n   - The distance from the Mummers Museum to The Pub on Passyunk East is approximately 1.1 miles (7 minutes by car).\n   - The distance from the Mummers Museum to Dirty Franks is approximately 0.9 miles (18 minutes by car).\n   - The distance from the Mummers Museum to Milkboy Coffee is approximately 1.7 miles (10 minutes by car).\n   - The distance from the Mummers Museum to Varga Bar & Restaurant is approximately 1.1 miles (10 minutes by car).\n   - The distance from the Mummers Museum to Alma de Cuba is approximately 2.2 miles (15 minutes by car).\n\n6. **NEXT STEPS**\n   - Verify the wheelchair accessibility of The Pub on Passyunk East, Dirty Franks, Milkboy Coffee, Varga Bar & Restaurant, and Alma de Cuba.\n   - Determine the exact distances from the Mummers Museum to these bars and compare them to find the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n\n### Educated Guesses and Reasoning\n- **Milkboy Coffee** is likely to be wheelchair accessible given its location in a busy, tourist-friendly area and its reputation as a modern, inclusive venue.\n- **Varga Bar & Restaurant** is also likely to be wheelchair accessible due to its central location and the trend of newer establishments catering to diverse needs.\n- **Alma de Cuba** is a well-known establishment and is likely to have accessibility features, but it is farther away from the Mummers Museum compared to the other options.\n- **The Pub on Passyunk East** and **Dirty Franks** are closer to the Mummers Museum, but their accessibility status needs to be confirmed.\n\nBy focusing on these next steps, we can narrow down the list and identify the closest wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Search Process**: The search process for the distances and accessibility information was not streamlined. We repeatedly searched for the same information without consolidating the findings.\n2. **Lack of Clear Tracking**: We did not keep a clear record of the distances and accessibility status of each bar, leading to redundant searches and confusion.\n3. **Incomplete Verification**: We did not fully verify the wheelchair accessibility of the bars, which is a critical requirement of the task.\n4. **Overlooking Specific Details**: We sometimes overlooked specific details such as exact addresses and distances, which are crucial for the final decision.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Consolidate Bar List**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for a list of bars near the Mummers Museum (1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147) and compile their addresses.\n   - **Record**: Create a list of bars with their addresses.\n\n2. **Verify Accessibility**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each bar on the list, search for information on wheelchair accessibility.\n   - **Record**: Note whether each bar is wheelchair accessible.\n\n3. **Calculate Distances**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to calculate the exact distances from the Mummers Museum to each wheelchair-accessible bar.\n   - **Record**: Note the distance for each bar.\n\n4. **Record Findings**\n   - **FileSurfer**: Create a file to record the distances and accessibility status of each bar.\n   - **Format**: Include the bar name, address, wheelchair accessibility status, and distance from the Mummers Museum.\n\n5. **Identify Closest Bar**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the recorded data to determine the closest wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum.\n   - **Final Answer**: Provide the name and address of the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Consolidate Bar List**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"bars near Mummers Museum 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147\" and compile a list of bars with their addresses.\n   - **Record**: Create a list of bars with their addresses.\n\n2. **Verify Accessibility**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each bar on the list, search for \"wheelchair accessible [bar name] [address]\" and note the accessibility status.\n   - **Record**: Update the list with the accessibility status.\n\n3. **Calculate Distances**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to calculate the distance from the Mummers Museum to each wheelchair-accessible bar.\n   - **Record**: Update the list with the distance for each bar.\n\n4. **Record Findings**\n   - **FileSurfer**: Create a file named `bar_distances.csv` to record the findings.\n   - **Python Script**: Use the following Python script to record the findings.\n\n```python\n# Example Python script to record findings\nimport csv\n\n# List of bars with their addresses and initial unknown values\nbars = [\n    {\"name\": \"The Pub on Passyunk East\", \"address\": \"1501 E Passyunk Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19147\", \"accessible\": \"Unknown\", \"distance\": \"Unknown\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Dirty Franks\", \"address\": \"1212 S 11th St, Philadelphia, PA 19147\", \"accessible\": \"Unknown\", \"distance\": \"Unknown\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Milkboy Coffee\", \"address\": \"1100 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19107\", \"accessible\": \"Unknown\", \"distance\": \"Unknown\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Varga Bar & Restaurant\", \"address\": \"941 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19107\", \"accessible\": \"Unknown\", \"distance\": \"Unknown\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Alma de Cuba\", \"address\": \"1623 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19103\", \"accessible\": \"Unknown\", \"distance\": \"Unknown\"}\n]\n\n# Function to record findings\ndef record_findings(bars, filename):\n    with open(filename, mode='w', newline='') as file:\n        writer = csv.writer(file)\n        writer.writerow([\"Name\", \"Address\", \"Wheelchair Accessible\", \"Distance (miles)\"])\n        for bar in bars:\n            writer.writerow([bar[\"name\"], bar[\"address\"], bar[\"accessible\"], bar[\"distance\"]])\n\n# Record initial findings\nrecord_findings(bars, \"bar_distances.csv\")\n```\n\n5. **Identify Closest Bar**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the `bar_distances.csv` file to determine the closest wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum.\n   - **Final Answer**: Provide the name and address of the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Use Google Maps API**: If necessary, consider using the Google Maps API to automate distance calculations.\n- **Check Multiple Sources**: Use multiple sources (Google Maps, Yelp, and local tourism websites) to verify wheelchair accessibility.\n- **Keep Track of Progress**: Regularly update the record file to avoid redundant searches and ensure accuracy.\n- **Be Specific**: Ensure that the search queries are specific to avoid irrelevant results. For example, use \"wheelchair accessible [bar name] [address]\" instead of just \"[bar name] wheelchair accessible\"."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich bar is closest to Mummers Museum in Philadelphia and is wheel chair accessible?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a bar closest to the Mummers Museum in Philadelphia.\n   - The bar must be wheelchair accessible.\n   - The Mummers Museum is located at 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n   - **The Pub on Passyunk East** is located at 1501 E Passyunk Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n   - **Dirty Franks** is located at 1212 S 11th St, Philadelphia, PA 19147.\n   - **Milkboy Coffee** is located at 1100 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19107.\n   - **Varga Bar & Restaurant** is located at 941 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19107.\n   - **Alma de Cuba** is located at 1623 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19103.\n   - The distance from the Mummers Museum to The Pub on Passyunk East is approximately 1.1 miles (7 minutes by car).\n   - The distance from the Mummers Museum to Dirty Franks is approximately 0.9 miles (18 minutes by car).\n   - The distance from the Mummers Museum to Milkboy Coffee is approximately 1.7 miles (10 minutes by car).\n   - The distance from the Mummers Museum to Varga Bar & Restaurant is approximately 1.1 miles (10 minutes by car).\n   - The distance from the Mummers Museum to Alma de Cuba is approximately 2.2 miles (15 minutes by car).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Information on the wheelchair accessibility of The Pub on Passyunk East, Dirty Franks, Milkboy Coffee, Varga Bar & Restaurant, and Alma de Cuba.\n   - **WHERE SPECIFICALLY**: Google Maps for locations and accessibility information; local tourism websites or Yelp for reviews and accessibility details.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The distance between the Mummers Museum and the nearest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n   - The relative proximity of each bar to the Mummers Museum.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **The Pub on Passyunk East** is likely to be wheelchair accessible given its modern setup and popularity in a tourist-friendly area.\n   - **Dirty Franks** is likely to be wheelchair accessible as it is a well-established bar in a bustling neighborhood.\n   - **Milkboy Coffee** is very likely to be wheelchair accessible due to its modern design and focus on inclusivity.\n   - **Varga Bar & Restaurant** is likely to be wheelchair accessible due to its central location and modern facilities.\n   - **Alma de Cuba** is likely to be wheelchair accessible as it is a high-profile establishment, but it is farther away from the Mummers Museum compared to the other options.\n\n5. **NEW INFORMATION**\n   - The distances from the Mummers Museum to the listed bars have been confirmed.\n   - **The Pub on Passyunk East** and **Dirty Franks** are the closest bars to the Mummers Museum, with distances of 1.1 miles and 0.9 miles, respectively.\n\n6. **NEXT STEPS**\n   - Verify the wheelchair accessibility of The Pub on Passyunk East, Dirty Franks, Milkboy Coffee, Varga Bar & Restaurant, and Alma de Cuba.\n   - Determine the exact distances from the Mummers Museum to these bars and compare them to find the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n\n### Educated Guesses and Reasoning\n- **The Pub on Passyunk East** and **Dirty Franks** are the closest bars to the Mummers Museum, making them the most likely candidates for the final answer.\n- **Milkboy Coffee** and **Varga Bar & Restaurant** are also strong contenders due to their likely accessibility and reasonable distances.\n- **Alma de Cuba**, while a well-known and likely accessible bar, is the farthest from the Mummers Museum and is less likely to be the closest option.\n\nBy verifying the wheelchair accessibility of these bars, we can confidently determine the closest wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum. Let's start with The Pub on Passyunk East and Dirty Franks, as they are the closest options.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Search Process**: The search process for the wheelchair accessibility status of the bars was not focused enough. We tried to search for multiple bars at once, which led to irrelevant results and made it difficult to extract specific information.\n2. **Lack of Clear Tracking**: We did not keep a clear and organized record of the search results, leading to redundant searches and confusion.\n3. **Incomplete Verification**: We did not fully verify the wheelchair accessibility of the bars, which is a critical requirement of the task.\n4. **Overlooking Specific Details**: We sometimes overlooked specific details such as exact addresses and distances, which are crucial for the final decision.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Consolidate Bar List**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"bars near Mummers Museum 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147\" and compile a list of bars with their addresses.\n   - **Record**: Create a list of bars with their addresses.\n\n2. **Verify Accessibility One by One**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each bar on the list, search for \"wheelchair accessible [bar name] [address]\" and note the accessibility status.\n   - **Record**: Update the list with the accessibility status for each bar.\n\n3. **Calculate Distances**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to calculate the exact distances from the Mummers Museum to each wheelchair-accessible bar.\n   - **Record**: Update the list with the distance for each bar.\n\n4. **Record Findings**\n   - **FileSurfer**: Create a file named `bar_distances.csv` to record the findings.\n   - **Python Script**: Use the following Python script to record the findings.\n\n```python\n# Example Python script to record findings\nimport csv\n\n# List of bars with their addresses and initial unknown values\nbars = [\n    {\"name\": \"The Pub on Passyunk East\", \"address\": \"1501 E Passyunk Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19147\", \"accessible\": \"Unknown\", \"distance\": \"Unknown\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Dirty Franks\", \"address\": \"1212 S 11th St, Philadelphia, PA 19147\", \"accessible\": \"Unknown\", \"distance\": \"Unknown\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Milkboy Coffee\", \"address\": \"1100 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19107\", \"accessible\": \"Unknown\", \"distance\": \"Unknown\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Varga Bar & Restaurant\", \"address\": \"941 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19107\", \"accessible\": \"Unknown\", \"distance\": \"Unknown\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Alma de Cuba\", \"address\": \"1623 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19103\", \"accessible\": \"Unknown\", \"distance\": \"Unknown\"}\n]\n\n# Function to record findings\ndef record_findings(bars, filename):\n    with open(filename, mode='w', newline='') as file:\n        writer = csv.writer(file)\n        writer.writerow([\"Name\", \"Address\", \"Wheelchair Accessible\", \"Distance (miles)\"])\n        for bar in bars:\n            writer.writerow([bar[\"name\"], bar[\"address\"], bar[\"accessible\"], bar[\"distance\"]])\n\n# Record initial findings\nrecord_findings(bars, \"bar_distances.csv\")\n```\n\n5. **Identify Closest Bar**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the `bar_distances.csv` file to determine the closest wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum.\n   - **Final Answer**: Provide the name and address of the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Consolidate Bar List**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"bars near Mummers Museum 1100 S 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19147\" and compile a list of bars with their addresses.\n   - **Record**: Create a list of bars with their addresses.\n\n2. **Verify Accessibility One by One**\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each bar on the list, search for \"wheelchair accessible [bar name] [address]\" and note the accessibility status.\n   - **Record**: Update the list with the accessibility status for each bar.\n   - **Example Searches**:\n     - \"wheelchair accessible The Pub on Passyunk East 1501 E Passyunk Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19147\"\n     - \"wheelchair accessible Dirty Franks 1212 S 11th St, Philadelphia, PA 19147\"\n     - \"wheelchair accessible Milkboy Coffee 1100 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19107\"\n     - \"wheelchair accessible Varga Bar & Restaurant 941 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19107\"\n     - \"wheelchair accessible Alma de Cuba 1623 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19103\"\n\n3. **Calculate Distances**\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to calculate the exact distances from the Mummers Museum to each wheelchair-accessible bar.\n   - **Record**: Update the list with the distance for each bar.\n   - **Example Searches**:\n     - Distance from Mummers Museum to The Pub on Passyunk East\n     - Distance from Mummers Museum to Dirty Franks\n     - Distance from Mummers Museum to Milkboy Coffee\n     - Distance from Mummers Museum to Varga Bar & Restaurant\n     - Distance from Mummers Museum to Alma de Cuba\n\n4. **Record Findings**\n   - **FileSurfer**: Create a file named `bar_distances.csv` to record the findings.\n   - **Python Script**: Use the provided Python script to record the findings.\n\n5. **Identify Closest Bar**\n   - **Assistant**: Review the `bar_distances.csv` file to determine the closest wheelchair-accessible bar to the Mummers Museum.\n   - **Final Answer**: Provide the name and address of the closest wheelchair-accessible bar.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Use Specific Search Queries**: Use specific search queries to avoid irrelevant results. For example, use \"wheelchair accessible [bar name] [address]\" instead of just \"[bar name] wheelchair accessible\".\n- **Check Multiple Sources**: Use multiple sources (Google Maps, Yelp, and local tourism websites) to verify wheelchair accessibility.\n- **Keep Track of Progress**: Regularly update the record file to avoid redundant searches and ensure accuracy.\n- **Be Thorough**: Ensure that the search queries are thorough and cover all necessary details, such as exact addresses and distances."}
