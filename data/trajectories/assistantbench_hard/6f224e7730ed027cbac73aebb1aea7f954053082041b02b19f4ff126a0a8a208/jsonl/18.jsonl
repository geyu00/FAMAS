{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich members of Fubo's Management Team joined the company during the same year Fubo's IPO happened?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - Fubo had an IPO (Initial Public Offering).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The year Fubo's IPO occurred.\n   - The current members of Fubo's Management Team.\n   - The years each member of Fubo's Management Team joined the company.\n   - Sources: Fubo's official website, SEC filings, press releases, and corporate news articles.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Which members of the Management Team joined in the same year as Fubo's IPO.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Fubo's IPO likely occurred within the last few years, given the company's relatively recent rise in the streaming market.\n   - Some members of the Management Team might have been part of the founding team, while others could have joined later, possibly around the time of the IPO to support growth and expansion.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Determine the Year of Fubo's IPO**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find the exact year Fubo went public.\n  \n- **Step 2: Identify Current Members of Fubo's Management Team**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit Fubo's official website and navigate to the \"Management Team\" or \"About Us\" section to compile a list of current management team members.\n\n- **Step 3: Find Joining Dates of Management Team Members**\n  - **WebSurfer**: For each identified member, search for their joining date. This information might be available on the company's website, press releases, or in news articles about their appointments.\n\n- **Step 4: Cross-Reference Joining Dates with IPO Year**\n  - **Assistant**: Compare the joining dates of the management team members with the year of Fubo's IPO to identify those who joined in the same year.\n\n- **Step 5: Compile and Present the Final List**\n  - **Assistant**: Create a list of the management team members who joined in the same year as Fubo's IPO and present it clearly."}
