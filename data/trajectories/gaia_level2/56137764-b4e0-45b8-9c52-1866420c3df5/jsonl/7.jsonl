{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a contributor to a version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n   - The contributors to that specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Authoritative sources for OpenCV contributors: OpenCV GitHub repository, official OpenCV documentation, release notes, and commit history.\n   - Authoritative sources for former Chinese heads of government: historical records, official government websites, and reputable news archives.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the names of contributors to the relevant OpenCV version with the names of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on common knowledge, the most prominent former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor is Deng Xiaoping, but this needs verification.\n   - Another possibility could be Li Peng, but again, this needs to be checked against the actual contributors.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added:**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to find the specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was introduced. Look for official OpenCV release notes or changelogs.\n  \n- **List the contributors to that version of OpenCV:**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Once the specific version is identified, navigate to the OpenCV GitHub repository and find the contributors to that version. This can be done by checking the release notes, commit history, or contributors list for that version.\n\n- **List the names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet:**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin script. Use reliable sources such as government websites, historical records, or reputable news archives.\n\n- **Cross-reference the names of contributors with the names of former Chinese heads of government:**\n  - **Assistant**: Compare the lists of contributors and former Chinese heads of government to identify any matches.\n\n- **Verify the findings:**\n  - **WebSurfer**: If a potential match is found, verify the contributor's involvement in the specific version of OpenCV by checking their contributions in the GitHub repository or other official sources.\n\n- **Report the findings:**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile the results and provide a clear answer to the original request."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a contributor to a version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - The OpenCV GitHub repository and its release notes are authoritative sources for identifying the version and contributors.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n   - The contributors to that specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Authoritative sources for OpenCV contributors: OpenCV GitHub repository, official OpenCV documentation, release notes, and commit history.\n   - Authoritative sources for former Chinese heads of government: historical records, official government websites, and reputable news archives.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the names of contributors to the relevant OpenCV version with the names of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on common knowledge, the most prominent former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor is Deng Xiaoping, but this needs verification.\n   - Another possibility could be Li Peng, but again, this needs to be checked against the actual contributors.\n   - From the release notes, it appears that Mask-RCNN support was likely added in a version around 4.5.5 or earlier, as this is a significant feature that would be mentioned in the change logs. We need to confirm this by reviewing the detailed change logs for these versions.\n   - The contributors to the OpenCV project are numerous, and the names are often in various languages. Therefore, it is important to carefully check the transliterations of names to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Additional Hunches:**\n   - Given the prominence of Deng Xiaoping in Chinese history and the likelihood of his name being used in various contexts, it is a strong candidate for matching a contributor's name. However, we should also consider other well-known figures like Li Peng and Zhu Rongji.\n   - The OpenCV project has contributors from various countries, including China. Therefore, it is plausible that a contributor with a name similar to a former Chinese head of government might be involved in the development of the Mask-RCNN support.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n   - Continue to review the detailed change logs for OpenCV versions around 4.5.5 to identify the exact version where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n   - Once the specific version is identified, compile a list of contributors to that version.\n   - Cross-reference the list of contributors with the names of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Navigation**: The previous attempts involved scrolling through multiple pages of release notes without a clear strategy to quickly locate the specific version where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n2. **Lack of Specific Search**: Instead of searching for the specific feature (Mask-RCNN support) within the release notes, the approach was too broad, leading to a time-consuming and ineffective process.\n3. **Incomplete Verification**: Even when the change logs were accessed, there was no systematic verification to ensure that the correct version and feature were identified.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Direct Search for Mask-RCNN Support**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a direct search on the OpenCV GitHub repository for the specific commit or pull request that added Mask-RCNN support. Use search terms like \"Mask-RCNN support added\" or \"Mask-RCNN feature\".\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the OpenCV GitHub repository and use the search function within the repository to find the relevant commit or pull request.\n\n2. **Identify the Specific Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the specific commit or pull request is found, note the version number and the date of the release.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the version number by checking the release notes or changelog for that version.\n\n3. **List Contributors to the Specific Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the release page for the identified version and find the contributors.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the contributors are not listed directly, navigate to the commit history for that version and compile a list of contributors.\n\n4. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin script. Use reliable sources such as government websites, historical records, or reputable news archives.\n\n5. **Cross-Reference Names**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the list of contributors to the list of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the match by checking the contributor's involvement in the specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n\n6. **Report the Findings**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the results and provide a clear answer to the original request.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**: When searching for the specific feature, use precise terms to narrow down the results.\n- **Navigate Efficiently**: Use the search function within the GitHub repository to quickly locate the relevant commit or pull request.\n- **Verify Information**: Double-check the version number and contributors to ensure accuracy.\n- **Systematic Comparison**: Ensure a systematic comparison of names to avoid missing any potential matches."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a contributor to a version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - The OpenCV GitHub repository and its release notes are authoritative sources for identifying the version and contributors.\n   - Initial searches for 'Mask-RCNN support added' and 'Mask-RCNN feature added' on the OpenCV GitHub repository did not yield direct results.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n   - The contributors to that specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Authoritative sources for OpenCV contributors: OpenCV GitHub repository, official OpenCV documentation, release notes, and commit history.\n   - Authoritative sources for former Chinese heads of government: historical records, official government websites, and reputable news archives.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the names of contributors to the relevant OpenCV version with the names of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on common knowledge, the most prominent former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor is Deng Xiaoping, but this needs verification.\n   - Another possibility could be Li Peng, but again, this needs to be checked against the actual contributors.\n   - From the release notes, it appears that Mask-RCNN support was likely added in a version around 4.5.5 or earlier, as this is a significant feature that would be mentioned in the change logs. We need to confirm this by reviewing the detailed change logs for these versions.\n   - The contributors to the OpenCV project are numerous, and the names are often in various languages. Therefore, it is important to carefully check the transliterations of names to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Additional Hunches:**\n   - Given the prominence of Deng Xiaoping in Chinese history and the likelihood of his name being used in various contexts, it is a strong candidate for matching a contributor's name. However, we should also consider other well-known figures like Li Peng and Zhu Rongji.\n   - The OpenCV project has contributors from various countries, including China. Therefore, it is plausible that a contributor with a name similar to a former Chinese head of government might be involved in the development of the Mask-RCNN support.\n   - Since direct searches for 'Mask-RCNN support added' did not yield results, it might be more effective to search for specific commits or pull requests that mention Mask-RCNN in the commit messages or titles.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n   - Perform a more targeted search on the OpenCV GitHub repository for specific commits or pull requests that mention Mask-RCNN.\n   - Use search terms like 'Mask-RCNN implementation', 'Mask-RCNN feature', or 'Mask-RCNN support'.\n   - Once the specific commit or pull request is found, note the version number and the date of the release.\n   - Navigate to the release page for the identified version and find the contributors.\n   - If the contributors are not listed directly, navigate to the commit history for that version and compile a list of contributors.\n   - Cross-reference the list of contributors with the names of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n1. **Perform a Targeted Search for Mask-RCNN Support**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the OpenCV GitHub repository and use the search function to find specific commits or pull requests that mention Mask-RCNN. Use search terms like 'Mask-RCNN implementation', 'Mask-RCNN feature', or 'Mask-RCNN support'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the version number and the date of the release once the relevant commit or pull request is found.\n\n2. **Identify the Specific Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the version number by checking the release notes or changelog for that version.\n\n3. **List Contributors to the Specific Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the release page for the identified version and find the contributors.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the contributors are not listed directly, navigate to the commit history for that version and compile a list of contributors.\n\n4. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin script. Use reliable sources such as government websites, historical records, or reputable news archives.\n\n5. **Cross-Reference Names**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the list of contributors to the list of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the match by checking the contributor's involvement in the specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n\n6. **Report the Findings**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the results and provide a clear answer to the original request.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**: When searching for the specific feature, use precise terms to narrow down the results.\n- **Navigate Efficiently**: Use the search function within the GitHub repository to quickly locate the relevant commit or pull request.\n- **Verify Information**: Double-check the version number and contributors to ensure accuracy.\n- **Systematic Comparison**: Ensure a systematic comparison of names to avoid missing any potential matches.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Search Terms**: The initial search terms used ('Mask-RCNN support added') were too broad and did not yield specific results.\n2. **Lack of Direct Commit Search**: The search was not focused enough on finding specific commits or pull requests that added Mask-RCNN support.\n3. **Missed Detailed Change Logs**: The detailed change logs and commit history were not thoroughly reviewed to identify the exact version and contributors.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Perform a More Targeted Search**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the OpenCV GitHub repository.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search function with more specific terms like 'Mask-RCNN implementation', 'Mask-RCNN feature', or 'Mask-RCNN support' to find the relevant commit or pull request.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the version number and the date of the release once the relevant commit or pull request is found.\n\n2. **Verify the Specific Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the release notes or changelog for the identified version to verify the addition of Mask-RCNN support.\n\n3. **List Contributors to the Specific Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the release page for the identified version and find the contributors.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the contributors are not listed directly, navigate to the commit history for that version and compile a list of contributors.\n\n4. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin script.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a contributor to a version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - The OpenCV GitHub repository and its release notes are authoritative sources for identifying the version and contributors.\n   - Initial searches for 'Mask-RCNN support added' and 'Mask-RCNN feature added' on the OpenCV GitHub repository did not yield direct results.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n   - The contributors to that specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Authoritative sources for OpenCV contributors: OpenCV GitHub repository, official OpenCV documentation, release notes, and commit history.\n   - Authoritative sources for former Chinese heads of government: historical records, official government websites, and reputable news archives.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-referencing the names of contributors to the relevant OpenCV version with the names of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on common knowledge, the most prominent former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor is Deng Xiaoping, but this needs verification.\n   - Another possibility could be Li Peng, but again, this needs to be checked against the actual contributors.\n   - From the release notes, it appears that Mask-RCNN support was likely added in a version around 4.5.5 or earlier, as this is a significant feature that would be mentioned in the change logs. We need to confirm this by reviewing the detailed change logs for these versions.\n   - The contributors to the OpenCV project are numerous, and the names are often in various languages. Therefore, it is important to carefully check the transliterations of names to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Additional Hunches:**\n   - Given the prominence of Deng Xiaoping in Chinese history and the likelihood of his name being used in various contexts, it is a strong candidate for matching a contributor's name. However, we should also consider other well-known figures like Li Peng and Zhu Rongji.\n   - The OpenCV project has contributors from various countries, including China. Therefore, it is plausible that a contributor with a name similar to a former Chinese head of government might be involved in the development of the Mask-RCNN support.\n   - Since direct searches for 'Mask-RCNN support added' did not yield results, it might be more effective to search for specific commits or pull requests that mention Mask-RCNN in the commit messages or titles.\n\n**New Hunches:**\n   - The specific commit or pull request that added Mask-RCNN support might be buried in the commit history and not easily found using search terms. Manually browsing through the commit history or release notes might be necessary.\n   - The name of the contributor might be a partial match or a variant of the name of a former Chinese head of government. For example, a contributor named \"Deng\" or \"Xiaoping\" might be sufficient to match Deng Xiaoping.\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n1. **Perform a Targeted Search for Mask-RCNN Support**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the OpenCV GitHub repository and use the search function to find specific commits or pull requests that mention Mask-RCNN. Use search terms like 'Mask-RCNN implementation', 'Mask-RCNN feature', or 'Mask-RCNN support'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If no results are found, manually browse through the commit history and release notes to identify the specific commit or pull request that added Mask-RCNN support.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note the version number and the date of the release once the relevant commit or pull request is found.\n\n2. **Identify the Specific Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the version number by checking the release notes or changelog for that version.\n\n3. **List Contributors to the Specific Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the release page for the identified version and find the contributors.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the contributors are not listed directly, navigate to the commit history for that version and compile a list of contributors.\n\n4. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin script. Use reliable sources such as government websites, historical records, or reputable news archives.\n\n5. **Cross-Reference Names**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the list of contributors to the list of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the match by checking the contributor's involvement in the specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n   - **Assistant**: Consider partial matches or variants of the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n6. **Report the Findings**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the results and provide a clear answer to the original request.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**: When searching for the specific feature, use precise terms to narrow down the results.\n- **Navigate Efficiently**: Use the search function within the GitHub repository to quickly locate the relevant commit or pull request.\n- **Verify Information**: Double-check the version number and contributors to ensure accuracy.\n- **Systematic Comparison**: Ensure a systematic comparison of names to avoid missing any potential matches.\n- **Manual Browsing**: If automated searches fail, manually browse through the commit history and release notes to find the relevant information.\n- **Consider Variants**: Be open to partial matches or variants of the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Ineffective Search Terms**: The search terms used ('Mask-RCNN support added', 'Mask-RCNN feature added') were too broad and did not yield specific results.\n2. **Lack of Manual Browsing**: Relying solely on automated searches without manually browsing through the commit history and release notes led to missing the relevant information.\n3. **Incomplete Cross-Referencing**: The list of contributors was not thoroughly cross-referenced with the names of former Chinese heads of government, considering partial matches and variants.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Perform a More Targeted Search**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the OpenCV GitHub repository.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use the search function with more specific terms like 'Mask-RCNN implementation', 'Mask-RCNN feature', or 'Mask-RCNN support'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If no results are found, manually browse through the commit history and release notes to identify the specific commit or pull request that added Mask-RCNN support.\n\n2. **Identify the Specific Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Once the relevant commit or pull request is found, note the version number and the date of the release.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the version number by checking the release notes or changelog for that version.\n\n3. **List Contributors to the Specific Version**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the release page for the identified version and find the contributors.\n   - **WebSurfer**: If the contributors are not listed directly, navigate to the commit history for that version and compile a list of contributors.\n\n4. **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search to compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin script. Use reliable sources such as government websites, historical records, or reputable news archives.\n\n5. **Cross-Reference Names**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the list of contributors to the list of former Chinese heads of government to find a match.\n   - **Assistant**: Consider partial matches or variants of the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n   - **Assistant**: Verify the match by checking the contributor's involvement in the specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n\n6. **Report the Findings**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile the results and provide a clear answer to the original request.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**: Use precise terms to narrow down the results.\n- **Manual Browsing**: If automated searches fail, manually browse through the commit history and release notes to find the relevant information.\n- **Verify Information**: Double-check the version number and contributors to ensure accuracy.\n- **Systematic Comparison**: Ensure a systematic comparison of names to avoid missing any potential matches.\n- **Consider Variants**: Be open to partial matches or variants of the names of former Chinese heads of government."}
