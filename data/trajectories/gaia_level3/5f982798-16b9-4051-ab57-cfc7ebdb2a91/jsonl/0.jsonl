There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - The paper contained a diagram of an X-ray time profile.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors published in July 2020.\n   - The user is asking for the difference in seconds in the measured time span between the two diagrams.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact duration of the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact duration of the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - The specific papers on Arxiv where these diagrams are found.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the measured time spans of the two diagrams.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The difference in seconds could be significant if the bursts have different characteristics or were observed under different conditions.\n   - The papers are likely to be well-documented, and the time spans should be clearly stated in the respective diagrams or in the text accompanying them.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Papers**: Use WebSurfer to search for the specific papers on Arxiv.org from March 2021 and July 2020 that contain the X-ray time profile and burst-1 diagram, respectively.\n- **Locate the Diagrams**: Once the papers are identified, use WebSurfer to navigate to the relevant sections of each paper to locate the diagrams.\n- **Extract Time Span Data**: Use WebSurfer to extract the measured time spans from the diagrams or the text accompanying the diagrams.\n- **Calculate the Difference**: Use Assistant to calculate the difference in seconds between the two measured time spans.\n- **Report the Result**: Provide the final difference in seconds as the answer to the user."}

Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks to be the only viable strategy. Additionally, small/medium size radiotelescopes co-pointing higher energies telescopes look a very interesting and cheap complementary observational strategy. \nComments:\n44 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication on Universe\nSubjects:\nHigh Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)Cite as:\narXiv:2103.07786 [astro-ph.HE] \n(or \narXiv:2103.07786v2 [astro-ph.HE] for this version) \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2103.07786\nFocus to learn more\nJournal reference:\nUniverse 2021, 7, 76\nRelated DOI: \nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/universe7030076\nFocus to learn more\nSubmission history\n From: Luciano Nicastro Dr. [\nview email] \n[v1] Sat, 13 Mar 2021 20:39:49 UTC (14,577 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 25 Mar 2021 10:44:14 UTC (1,195 KB)\nAccess Paper:\nView PDFTeX SourceOther Formatsview license Current browse context: \nastro-ph.HE\n< prev  |  \nnext >new \n | recent \n | 2021-03 Change to browse by: \nastro-phReferences & Citations\nINSPIRE HEPNASA ADSGoogle ScholarSemantic Scholarexport BibTeX citation\nBookmark\n Bibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer \nCode, Data, Media\nDemos\nRelated Papers\n About arXivLabs\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"msapplication-TileColor\": \"#da532c\",\n        \"theme-color\": \"#ffffff\",\n        \"description\": \"Abstract page for arXiv paper 2103.07786: Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"arXiv.org\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07786v2\",\n        \"og:image\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:secure_url\": \"/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"1200\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"700\",\n        \"og:image:alt\": \"arXiv logo\",\n        \"og:description\": \"The origin and phenomenology of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) remains unknown despite more than a decade of efforts.

Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives …其他人也問了以下問題\nWhat is a fast radio burst?\nProvided by the Springer Nature SharedIt content-sharing initiative Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio transients originating from sources at extragalactic distances1, the origin of which is unknown. Some FRB sources emit repeat bursts, ruling out cataclysmic origins for those events2–4.Periodic activity from a fast radio burst source - NatureWhat is the periodicity of the fast radio burst 180916 J0158+65?\nA periodicity of roughly 16 days is detected for the fast radio burst 180916.J0158+65, suggesting that the burst arises from a periodically modulated mechanism instead of a cataclysmic or sporadic process.Periodic activity from a fast radio burst source - NatureAre FRB 121102 bursts clustered 8?\nHowever, for the first repeater, FRB 121102, in which no periodicity has yet been found, the bursts are observed to be clustered 8. This triggers the concern that the arrival times of nearby bursts in FRB 180916.J0158+65 may not be independent.Periodic activity from a fast radio burst source - NatureWhat is the arrival phase of a burst?\nThe arrival phase of the bursts within the 16.35-d cycle is given in the top left corner of each spectrum. Each plot also gives the 0.98304-ms time-resolution dedispersed intensity data with the integrated burst profile on top and the on-pulse spectrum on the right (arbitrary units). Intensity values are saturated at the 5th and 95th percentiles.Periodic activity from a fast radio burst source - NatureWhat is the DM of the brightest burst detected by EVN?\nAs the DMs fitted at high time resolution are all consistent with one average DM = 348.82 pc cm −3 (which is also consistent with the DM of the brightest burst detected by the EVN), we use that value to dedisperse intensity data for visualization of the millisecond-resolution data.Periodic activity from a fast radio\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\n        \"SystemEntropyOriginTrialToken\": \"A5is4nwJJVnhaJpUr1URgj4vvAXSiHoK0VBbM9fawMskbDUj9WUREpa3JzGAo6xd1Cp2voQEG1h6NQ71AsMznU8AAABxeyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaW5nLmNvbTo0NDMiLCJmZWF0dXJlIjoiTXNVc2VyQWdlbnRMYXVuY2hOYXZUeXBlIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNzUzNzQ3MjAwLCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZX0=\",\n        \"ConfidenceOriginTrialToken\": \"Aqw360MHzRcmtEVv55zzdIWcTk2BBYHcdBAOysNJZP4qkN8M+5vUq36ITHFVst8LiX36KBZJXB8xvyBgdK2z5Q0AAAB6eyJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL2JpbmcuY29tOjQ0MyIsImZlYXR1cmUiOiJQZXJmb3JtYW5jZU5hdmlnYXRpb25UaW1pbmdDb25maWRlbmNlIiwiZXhwaXJ5IjoxNzYwNDAwMDAwLCJpc1N1YmRvbWFpbiI6dHJ1ZX0=\",\n        \"og:description\": \"Bing \\u7684\\u667a\\u6167\\u578b\\u641c\\u5c0b\\u53ef\\u8b93\\u60a8\\u66f4\\u8f15\\u800c\\u6613\\u8209\\u627e\\u5230\\u60f3\\u627e\\u7684\\u8cc7\\u8a0a\\uff0c\\u540c\\u6642\\u9084\\u56e0\\u6b64\\u7372\\u5f97\\u734e\\u52f5\\u3002\",\n        \"og:site_name\": \"Bing\",\n        \"og:title\": \"Arxiv.org paper July 2020 burst-1 diagram author Luciano Nicastro Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts - Bing\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://www.bing.com/search?q=Arxiv.org+paper+July+2020+burst-1+diagram+author+Luciano+Nicastro+Multiwavelength+observations+of+Fast+Radio+Bursts&FORM=QBLH\",\n        \"fb:app_id\": \"3732605936979161\",\n        \"og:image\": \"http://www.bing.com/sa/simg/facebook_sharing_5.png\",\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\n        \"og:image:width\": \"600\",\n        \"og:image:height\": \"315\"\n    }\n}\n\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nI read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The user read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n   - The paper contained a diagram of an X-ray time profile.\n   - There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors published in July 2020.\n   - The user is asking for the difference in seconds in the measured time span between the two diagrams.\n   - The March 2021 paper is titled \"Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts\" by Luciano Nicastro et al. and is available on Arxiv.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact duration of the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n   - The exact duration of the burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n   - The specific paper on Arxiv from July 2020 that includes a burst-1 diagram and is authored by one of the same authors as the March 2021 paper.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The difference in seconds between the measured time spans of the two diagrams.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The difference in seconds could be significant if the bursts have different characteristics or were observed under different conditions.\n   - The papers are likely to be well-documented, and the time spans should be clearly stated in the respective diagrams or in the text accompanying them.\n   - Given that both papers are on the topic of fast radio bursts and involve the same authors, there is a high likelihood that the methodologies and terminologies used are consistent, which could help in locating the relevant data more efficiently.\n   - The July 2020 paper might be related to a specific event or observation that was later expanded upon in the March 2021 paper, which could provide additional context for the differences in the time spans.\n\n**Additional Hunches:**\n   - Since the March 2021 paper is a summary of multiwavelength observations, it might reference or build upon the findings from the July 2020 paper. Checking the references or citations in the March 2021 paper could lead us to the July 2020 paper.\n   - The X-ray time profile and the burst-1 diagram might have been observed using different instruments or telescopes, which could account for variations in the measured time spans.\n\nLet's proceed with the next steps to locate the July 2020 paper and extract the necessary data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Ineffective Search Queries**: The search queries used to find the July 2020 paper were too broad and did not yield the specific paper the user was referring to.\n2. **Rate Limiting**: One of the search attempts led to a rate limit issue on the Internet Archive Scholar, preventing further access to that resource.\n3. **Lack of Specificity**: The search terms did not sufficiently narrow down the results to the specific paper with the burst-1 diagram.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Query**:\n   - Use a more specific search query to find the July 2020 paper.\n   - Include keywords like \"burst-1 diagram\" and the author's name in the search query.\n\n2. **Direct Access to Arxiv**:\n   - Directly access Arxiv.org and use their advanced search features to find the July 2020 paper.\n   - Use the author's name and the specific date range to narrow down the search.\n\n3. **Check References**:\n   - Review the references in the March 2021 paper to see if it cites the July 2020 paper.\n   - This can provide a direct link to the relevant paper.\n\n4. **Manual Verification**:\n   - Once the papers are located, manually verify the diagrams and extract the time span data.\n   - Ensure that the diagrams are correctly identified and the time spans are accurately measured.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Query**\n  - Use the search query: `Arxiv.org paper July 2020 burst-1 diagram author Luciano Nicastro site:arxiv.org`\n  - Perform the search on a search engine and review the results.\n\n- **Step 2: Direct Access to Arxiv**\n  - Go to Arxiv.org.\n  - Use the advanced search feature.\n  - Enter the author's name (Luciano Nicastro) and the date range (July 2020).\n\n- **Step 3: Check References**\n  - Open the March 2021 paper on Arxiv.\n  - Scroll to the references section.\n  - Look for any citations to a paper from July 2020 that includes a burst-1 diagram.\n\n- **Step 4: Manual Verification**\n  - Once the July 2020 paper is located, open it.\n  - Locate the burst-1 diagram.\n  - Extract the time span data from the diagram or the accompanying text.\n  - Compare the time span with the X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n  - Calculate the difference in seconds.\n\n### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes\n\n- **Use Specific Keywords**: Always include specific keywords like \"burst-1 diagram\" and the author's name to narrow down the search results.\n- **Check Rate Limits**: Be aware of rate limits on external sites and avoid excessive requests in a short period.\n- **Verify Results**: Manually verify the relevance of the search results to ensure they match the user's requirements.\n- **Cross-Reference**: Use multiple methods (search engines, Arxiv, and references) to cross-verify the location of the July 2020 paper."}

We find no strict periodicity[2206.03759] A burst storm from the repeating FRB 20200120E in an M…Does a burst storm have a strict periodicity?\nWe find no strict periodicity in the burst arrival times, nor any evidence for periodicity in the source's activity between observations. The burst storm shows a steep energy distribution (power-law index α = 2.39 ± 0.12) and a bi-modal wait-time distribution, with log-normal means of 0.94 +0.07−0.06 s and 23.61 +3.06−2.71 s.[2206.03759] A burst storm from the repeating FRB 20200120E in an M…What is the energy distribution of a burst storm?\nThe burst storm shows a steep energy distribution (power-law index α = 2.39 ± 0.12) and a bi-modal wait-time distribution, with log-normal means of 0.94 +0.07−0.06 s and 23.61 +3.06−2.71 s. We attribute these wait-time distribution peaks to a characteristic event timescale and pseudo-Poisson burst rate, respectively.[2206.03759] A burst storm from the repeating FRB 20200120E in an M…What is the narrowest burst component?\nThe narrowest component has a width of ≲ 100 ns, which corresponds to a light travel time size as small as 30 m, the smallest associated with an FRB to date.
