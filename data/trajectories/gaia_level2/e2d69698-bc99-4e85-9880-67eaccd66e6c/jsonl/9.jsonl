Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question is asking about the US version of Survivor.\n   - The specific criterion is being born in the month of May.\n   - The time frame is as of August 2023.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of all winners of the US version of Survivor.\n   - The birth months of these winners.\n   - These details can be found on official Survivor websites, Wikipedia pages dedicated to Survivor, and possibly fan sites or databases that track Survivor contestants and their personal information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are needed beyond cross-referencing the birth months with the list of winners.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on my knowledge of Survivor, I recall that several notable winners have been discussed in interviews and articles, but I do not have immediate recall of their specific birth months. Therefore, I cannot confidently guess the answer without looking up the information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to search for a comprehensive list of all US Survivor winners.\n- **Step 2**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to a reliable source (e.g., Wikipedia, official Survivor website) that provides detailed information about each winner, including their birth dates.\n- **Step 3**: Use WebSurfer to extract and compile the birth months of all the winners.\n- **Step 4**: Identify the winner(s) born in May.\n- **Step 5**: Verify the information to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n- **Step 6**: Provide the final answer, including the name of the winner born in May."}

The American series premiered on May 31, 2000, on \nCBS. It is hosted by \nJeff Probst, who is also an \nexecutive producer along with \nMark Burnett and the original creator, Parsons. \nSurvivor places a group of people in an isolated location, where they must provide food, fire, and shelter for themselves. The contestants compete in challenges including testing the contestants' physical abilities like running and swimming or their mental abilities like puzzles and endurance challenges for rewards and \nimmunity from elimination. The contestants are progressively eliminated from the game as they are voted out by their fellow contestants until only two or three remain. At that point, the contestants who were eliminated vote for the winner. They are given the title of \"Sole Survivor\" and are awarded the grand prize of $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 in \nWinners at War). \nThe American version has been very successful. From the \n2000–01 through the \n2005–06 television seasons, its first 11 seasons (competitions) rated among the top 10 most-watched shows. It is commonly considered the leader of American \nreality TV because it was the first \nhighly rated and profitable reality show on \nbroadcast television in the U.S., and is considered one of the best shows of the 2000s (decade).\n[1][2][3] The series has been nominated for 63 \nEmmy Awards, including winning for Outstanding Sound Mixing in 2001, Outstanding Special Class Program in 2002, and was subsequently nominated four times for \nOutstanding Reality-Competition Program when the category was introduced in 2003.

Sixteen or more players, split between two or more \"tribes\", are taken to a remote isolated location (usually in a tropical climate) and are forced to live off the land with meager supplies for 39 days (42 in \nThe Australian Outback, 26 in post-\nCOVID seasons).\n[a] Frequent physical and mental challenges are used to pit the teams against each other for rewards, such as food or luxuries, or for \"immunity\", forcing the other tribe to attend \"Tribal Council\", where they must vote off one of their tribemates. \nSignaling the halfway point in the game, survivors from both tribes come together to live as one, making it to the \"merge\". At this point, survivors will compete against each other to win individual immunity; winning immunity prevents that player from being voted out at Tribal Council. Most players that are voted out after the merge form the game's \"jury\". Once the group gets down to two or three people, a Final Tribal Council is held where the remaining players plead their case to the jury members. The jury then votes for which player should be considered the \"Sole Survivor\" and win the show's grand prize. In all seasons for the American version (excluding \nSurvivor: Winners at War whose winner won $2 million), this has included a $1-million prize in addition to the Sole Survivor title; some seasons (particularly earlier seasons) have included additional prizes offered during the game, such as a car, as well as fan-favorite prizes awarded at the finale. All contestants are paid on a sliding scale based on the order they were voted out: the first player voted out has been given \nUS$2,500 and the amount increases from there. Some of the seasons that have featured returning players have increased these amounts: \nSurvivor: All-Stars featured payouts starting at \nUS$5,000, while \nWinners at War had a minimum \nUS$25,000 payout. All players are offered \nUS$10,000 for participating in the finale show.\n[9]\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

All players are offered \nUS$10,000 for participating in the finale show.\n[9]The American version has introduced numerous modifications, or \"twists\", on the core rules in order to keep the players on their toes and to prevent players from relying on strategies that succeeded in prior seasons. These changes have included tribal switches, seasons starting with more than two tribes, the ability to exile a player from a tribe for a short time on \"Exile Island\", hidden immunity idols that players can use to save themselves or others at Tribal Council, special voting powers which can be used to influence the result at Tribal Council, the chance to return to regular gameplay after elimination through \"Redemption Island\", \"Edge of Extinction\" or \"The Outcast Tribe\" twists, and special advantages to help players in the game like an extra vote, the ability to steal a vote, a idol nullifier, and a final four fire-making challenge as of season 35. \nSeries overview[edit]See also: \nList of Survivor (American TV series) episodes (seasons 1–20), \nList of Survivor (American TV series) episodes (seasons 21–40), and \nList of Survivor (American TV series) episodes (seasons 41–present)The United States version is produced by \nMark Burnett and hosted by \nJeff Probst, who also serves as an executive producer.

Starting with the third season, \nSurvivor: Africa, there have been two seasons aired during each American television season.\n[b] Starting with the 41st season, no subtitle has been used in promotion of the season. Instead, the show began following a number format similar to \nBig Brother and \nThe Amazing Race. \nIn the first season, there was a 75-person crew.

Parsons formed Planet 24 with \nBob Geldof to produce the show and tried to have the \nBBC broadcast it, but the network turned it down. Parsons went to Swedish television and was able to find a broadcaster, ultimately producing \nExpedition Robinson in 1997. The show was a success, and plans for international versions were made.\n[25]Mark Burnett intended to be the person to bring the show to the United States, though he viewed the Swedish version as a bit crude and mean-spirited. Burnett retooled the concept to use better production values, based on his prior \nEco-Challenge show, and wanted to focus more on the human drama experienced while under pressure. Burnett spent about a year trying to find a broadcaster that would take the show, retooling the concept based on feedback. On November 24, 1999, Burnett made his pitch to \nLes Moonves of \nCBS, and Moonves agreed to pick up the show.\n[25] The first season, \nSurvivor: Borneo, was filmed during March and April 2000, and was first broadcast on May 31, 2000. The first season became a ratings success, leading to its ongoing run.\n[25]Locations[edit]\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAs of August 2023, who is the only winner of the US version of Survivor to be born in the month of May?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question is asking about the US version of Survivor.\n   - The specific criterion is being born in the month of May.\n   - The time frame is as of August 2023.\n   - Richard Hatch, the winner of Survivor: Borneo, was born on May 31, 1963.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of all winners of the US version of Survivor.\n   - The birth months of these winners.\n   - These details can be found on official Survivor websites, Wikipedia pages dedicated to Survivor, and possibly fan sites or databases that track Survivor contestants and their personal information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the birth months with the list of winners to identify the winner(s) born in May.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Richard Hatch** is the only verified winner born in May based on the information we have so far. Given that he is the only one we have confirmed, it is a strong possibility that he is the only winner of the US version of Survivor born in May.\n   - We need to verify the birth months of the other winners to confirm if there are any other May-born winners.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Richard Hatch** is the only winner whose birth date we have confirmed to be in May.\n- The search results provided some birth dates, but they were mostly incorrect or incomplete. For example, many winners were listed with the same birth date (February 11, 1964), which is likely a placeholder or error.\n- To ensure accuracy, we need to verify the birth months of the other winners from a reliable source.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Use WebSurfer to find a reliable source that lists the birth dates of all US Survivor winners.\n- Cross-reference the birth months to confirm if Richard Hatch is the only May-born winner.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Information**: The search results provided incorrect or placeholder birth dates for many of the winners, which led to confusion and incorrect data.\n- **Lack of Reliable Source**: The sources used did not provide accurate and comprehensive birth date information for all the winners.\n- **Incomplete Verification**: We did not systematically verify the birth dates of all winners, focusing too much on the initial search results.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to search for a reliable and comprehensive list of all US Survivor winners with their detailed biographies, including birth dates.\n  - **Hint**: Use a search query like \"US Survivor winners detailed biographies\" or \"US Survivor winners full profiles.\"\n- **Step 2**: Navigate to a reliable source, such as the official Survivor website, Wikipedia, or a reputable fan site.\n  - **Hint**: Look for pages that have detailed contestant profiles, such as the Survivor Wiki or official CBS pages.\n- **Step 3**: Extract the birth dates of all the winners from the chosen source.\n  - **Hint**: Ensure the source is reputable and the information is consistent across multiple entries.\n- **Step 4**: Compile a list of all the winners and their birth months.\n- **Step 5**: Identify the winner(s) born in May.\n- **Step 6**: Verify the information to ensure accuracy.\n- **Step 7**: Provide the final answer, including the name of the winner born in May.\n\n### Execution\n\n- **Step 1**: Perform a web search for a reliable source.\n  - **Action**: Type \"US Survivor winners detailed biographies\" into the search bar.\n- **Step 2**: Navigate to the most reliable source found.\n  - **Action**: Click on the most relevant and reputable link.\n- **Step 3**: Extract the birth dates of all the winners.\n  - **Action**: Scroll through the page and note the birth dates of each winner.\n- **Step 4**: Compile the list.\n  - **Action**: Create a list of winners and their birth months.\n- **Step 5**: Identify the winner(s) born in May.\n  - **Action**: Filter the list to find the winner(s) born in May.\n- **Step 6**: Verify the information.\n  - **Action**: Double-check the birth dates from another reliable source if necessary.\n- **Step 7**: Provide the final answer.\n  - **Action**: State the name of the winner born in May."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAs of August 2023, who is the only winner of the US version of Survivor to be born in the month of May?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The question is asking about the US version of Survivor.\n   - The specific criterion is being born in the month of May.\n   - The time frame is as of August 2023.\n   - Richard Hatch, the winner of Survivor: Borneo, was born on May 31, 1963.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of all winners of the US version of Survivor.\n   - The birth months of these winners.\n   - These details can be found on official Survivor websites, Wikipedia pages dedicated to Survivor, and possibly fan sites or databases that track Survivor contestants and their personal information.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the birth months with the list of winners to identify the winner(s) born in May.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Richard Hatch** is the only verified winner born in May based on the information we have so far. Given that he is the only one we have confirmed, it is a strong possibility that he is the only winner of the US version of Survivor born in May.\n   - **Other Potential Sources**: We should explore additional sources like the official Survivor website, Wikipedia, and fan sites like SurvivorHistory.com or the Survivor Wiki to gather accurate birth dates for all winners.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Richard Hatch** is the only winner whose birth date we have confirmed to be in May.\n- The search results provided some birth dates, but they were mostly incorrect or incomplete. For example, many winners were listed with the same birth date (February 11, 1964), which is likely a placeholder or error.\n- To ensure accuracy, we need to verify the birth months of the other winners from a reliable source.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Use WebSurfer to find a reliable source that lists the birth dates of all US Survivor winners.\n  - **Action**: Perform a web search using queries like \"US Survivor winners detailed profiles with birth dates\" or \"US Survivor winners complete list with birth dates.\"\n- Cross-reference the birth months to confirm if Richard Hatch is the only May-born winner.\n  - **Action**: Navigate to the most reliable source found and extract the birth dates of all the winners.\n- Verify the information to ensure accuracy.\n  - **Action**: Double-check the birth dates from another reliable source if necessary.\n- Provide the final answer, including the name of the winner born in May.\n  - **Action**: State the name of the winner born in May once all the information is verified.\n\n### Execution:\n- **Step 1**: Perform a web search for a reliable source.\n  - **Action**: Type \"US Survivor winners detailed profiles with birth dates\" into the search bar.\n- **Step 2**: Navigate to the most reliable source found.\n  - **Action**: Click on the most relevant and reputable link.\n- **Step 3**: Extract the birth dates of all the winners.\n  - **Action**: Scroll through the page and note the birth dates of each winner.\n- **Step 4**: Compile a list of all the winners and their birth months.\n  - **Action**: Create a list of winners and their birth months.\n- **Step 5**: Identify the winner(s) born in May.\n  - **Action**: Filter the list to find the winner(s) born in May.\n- **Step 6**: Verify the information.\n  - **Action**: Double-check the birth dates from another reliable source if necessary.\n- **Step 7**: Provide the final answer.\n  - **Action**: State the name of the winner born in May.\n\nPlease proceed with the next step by performing a web search for a reliable source that lists the birth dates of all US Survivor winners.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Information**: The search results provided incorrect or placeholder birth dates for many of the winners, leading to confusion and incorrect data.\n- **Lack of Reliable Source**: The sources used did not provide accurate and comprehensive birth date information for all the winners.\n- **Incomplete Verification**: We did not systematically verify the birth dates of all winners, focusing too much on the initial search results.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Perform a web search for a reliable and comprehensive list of all US Survivor winners with their detailed biographies, including birth dates.\n  - **Action**: Type \"US Survivor winners detailed profiles with birth dates\" into the search bar.\n  - **Hint**: Look for reputable sources like the official Survivor website, Wikipedia, or fan sites like SurvivorHistory.com or the Survivor Wiki.\n\n- **Step 2**: Navigate to the most reliable source found.\n  - **Action**: Click on the most relevant and reputable link.\n  - **Hint**: Ensure the source is well-maintained and has detailed contestant profiles.\n\n- **Step 3**: Extract the birth dates of all the winners from the chosen source.\n  - **Action**: Scroll through the page and note the birth dates of each winner.\n  - **Hint**: Pay attention to the format and consistency of the birth dates to avoid placeholder or incorrect data.\n\n- **Step 4**: Compile a list of all the winners and their birth months.\n  - **Action**: Create a list of winners and their birth months.\n  - **Hint**: Use a structured format to ensure clarity and accuracy.\n\n- **Step 5**: Identify the winner(s) born in May.\n  - **Action**: Filter the list to find the winner(s) born in May.\n  - **Hint**: Double-check the birth dates to ensure no errors.\n\n- **Step 6**: Verify the information to ensure accuracy.\n  - **Action**: Cross-reference the birth dates from another reliable source if necessary.\n  - **Hint**: Use multiple sources to cross-verify critical information.\n\n- **Step 7**: Provide the final answer.\n  - **Action**: State the name of the winner born in May.\n  - **Hint**: Clearly state the final answer and any additional relevant information.\n\n### Execution\n\n- **Step 1**: Perform a web search.\n  - **Action**: Type \"US Survivor winners detailed profiles with birth dates\" into the search bar.\n- **Step 2**: Navigate to the most reliable source.\n  - **Action**: Click on the most relevant and reputable link.\n- **Step 3**: Extract the birth dates.\n  - **Action**: Scroll through the page and note the birth dates of each winner.\n- **Step 4**: Compile the list.\n  - **Action**: Create a list of winners and their birth months.\n- **Step 5**: Identify the winner(s) born in May.\n  - **Action**: Filter the list to find the winner(s) born in May.\n- **Step 6**: Verify the information.\n  - **Action**: Cross-reference the birth dates from another reliable source if necessary.\n- **Step 7**: Provide the final answer.\n  -
