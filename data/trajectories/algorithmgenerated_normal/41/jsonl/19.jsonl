I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin. Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nTranslate the sentence 'I like apples' to Tizin language.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Identify the correct sentence structure in Tizin (Verb - Direct Object - Subject).\n2. Determine the appropriate verb form for 'like' in the present tense.\n3. Find the correct accusative form of 'apples'.\n4. Use the nominative form for 'I'.\n5. Combine the elements following the Tizin sentence structure.\n\n## Output format\nProvide the translated sentence in Tizin.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\nEnsure the translation accurately follows the Tizin language rules and structure."}

Let's go through each step together to ensure everything aligns with the Tizin language rules.\n\n1. The sentence structure in Tizin is confirmed as Verb - Direct Object - Subject.\n2. The verb \"Maktay\" is indeed the correct form for \"like\" in the present tense.\n3. \"Zapple\" is correctly identified as the accusative form of \"apples\".\n4. \"Pa\" is accurate for the nominative form of \"I\".\n\nNow, combining all the elements as per the Tizin structure results in:\n\n- **Verb**: Maktay\n- **Direct Object**: Zapple\n- **Subject**: Pa\n\nThus, the translation of \"I like apples\" is:\n\n**Maktay Zapple Pa**.\n\nI agree with the translation and confirm it follows the rules of Tizin accurately.
