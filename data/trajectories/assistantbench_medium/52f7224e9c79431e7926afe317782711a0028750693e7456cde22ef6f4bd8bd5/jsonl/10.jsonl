{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be an Isabelle Adjani feature film.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDB ratings for Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, but without looking up the specific ratings and runtimes, it's difficult to guess which one would be the highest-rated and under 2 hours.\n   - Fandango at Home likely has a catalog of Isabelle Adjani's films, but the exact titles and their availability need to be verified.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to search for Isabelle Adjani's filmography on IMDB.\n- **Step 2:** Use WebSurfer to filter the results to show only feature films with a runtime less than 2 hours.\n- **Step 3:** Use WebSurfer to note the IMDB ratings of these filtered films.\n- **Step 4:** Use WebSurfer to navigate to Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu) and search for the availability of the top-rated films from the previous step.\n- **Step 5:** Identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n- **Step 6:** Provide the final answer, including the title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be an Isabelle Adjani feature film.\n   - The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The IMDB ratings for Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, but without looking up the specific ratings and runtimes, it's difficult to guess which one would be the highest-rated and under 2 hours. However, some of her well-known films include \"Possession\" (1981), \"Camille Claudel\" (1988), and \"One Deadly Summer\" (1983).\n   - Fandango at Home likely has a catalog of Isabelle Adjani's films, but the exact titles and their availability need to be verified. Given her international acclaim, it is reasonable to assume that many of her films are available on major streaming platforms.\n   - Based on her filmography, \"Possession\" (1981) and \"Camille Claudel\" (1988) are highly rated and might be under 2 hours. \"Possession\" has a runtime of 1 hour and 42 minutes, and \"Camille Claudel\" has a runtime of 2 hours and 15 minutes, so \"Possession\" is a strong candidate.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **\"Possession\" (1981)**: This film is known for its high critical acclaim and has a runtime of 1 hour and 42 minutes, making it a strong candidate.\n- **\"Camille Claudel\" (1988)**: While highly rated, it exceeds the 2-hour limit, so it is not a viable option.\n- **\"One Deadly Summer\" (1983)**: Another critically acclaimed film, but its runtime needs to be verified.\n\nNext Steps:\n- **Step 1:** Use WebSurfer to navigate to Isabelle Adjani's filmography on IMDB and extract the IMDB ratings and runtimes for her feature films.\n- **Step 2:** Filter the films to those that are less than 2 hours long.\n- **Step 3:** Check the availability of these filtered films on Fandango at Home.\n- **Step 4:** Identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of Failure\n\n1. **Navigation Issues**: The WebSurfer did not successfully navigate to the 'Filmography' section of Isabelle Adjani's IMDB page, despite multiple attempts to scroll down. This suggests that the viewport might not be correctly positioned or the content might not be loading as expected.\n2. **Incomplete Data Collection**: Even when the WebSurfer managed to scroll down, it did not capture the necessary data (ratings and runtimes) for Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n3. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were too general, leading to inefficiencies in navigating and extracting the required information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the 'Filmography' Section Directly**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate directly to the 'Filmography' section of Isabelle Adjani's IMDB page using a specific URL or by clicking on the 'Filmography' tab.\n   - Ensure the viewport is positioned correctly to capture the 'Filmography' section.\n\n2. **Extract Detailed Information**:\n   - Once in the 'Filmography' section, use WebSurfer to extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Filter the films to those that are less than 2 hours long.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to search for the filtered films on Fandango at Home.\n   - Verify the availability of each film to buy or rent.\n\n4. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - Compare the IMDB ratings of the available films that meet all criteria.\n   - Identify the highest-rated film and provide the final answer.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the 'Filmography' Section**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's IMDB page: `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/`.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on the 'Filmography' tab or use a direct link to the 'Filmography' section if available.\n\n2. **Extract Detailed Information**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down to the 'Actress' section within the 'Filmography'.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Filter the films to those that are less than 2 hours long.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to Fandango at Home: `https://www.fandango.com/vod`.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for each of the filtered films.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the availability of each film to buy or rent.\n\n4. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Compare the IMDB ratings of the available films.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Identify the highest-rated film that meets all criteria.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Provide the final answer, including the title, IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home.\n\n### Example Commands\n\n1. **Navigate to the 'Filmography' Section**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/\")\n   WebSurfer.click(\"a[data-testid='name-filmography']\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Extract Detailed Information**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.scroll_down(3)  # Scroll down to ensure the 'Actress' section is visible\n   filmography = WebSurfer.extract_elements(\"div[data-testid='filmo-row']\")\n   for film in filmography:\n       title = film.find_element(\"a\").text\n       rating = film.find_element(\"span[data-testid='title-rating']\").text\n       runtime = film.find_element(\"span[data-testid='runtime']\").text\n       if int(runtime.split()[0]) < 120:  # Filter films less than 2 hours\n           print(f\"Title: {title}, Rating: {rating}, Runtime: {runtime}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://www.fandango.com/vod\")\n   for title in filtered_films:\n       WebSurfer.search(title)\n       availability = WebSurfer.extract_element(\"button[data-testid='rent-or-buy-button']\").text\n       if \"Rent\" in availability or \"Buy\" in availability:\n           print(f\"{title} is available on Fandango at Home\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   ```sh\n   highest_rated_film = max(filtered_films, key=lambda x: x['rating'])\n   print(f\"Highest Rated Film: {highest_rated_film['title']}, Rating: {highest_rated_film['rating']}, Runtime: {highest_rated_film['runtime']}, Available on Fandango at Home\")\n   ```\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to efficiently navigate to the required sections, extract the necessary data, and identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n- The film must be an Isabelle Adjani feature film.\n- The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n- The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n- The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n#### 2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n- The IMDB ratings for Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n- The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n- The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n#### 3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n- The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n#### 4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n- **Isabelle Adjani's Filmography**: Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, but without looking up the specific ratings and runtimes, it's difficult to guess which one would be the highest-rated and under 2 hours. However, some of her well-known films include \"Possession\" (1981), \"Camille Claudel\" (1988), and \"One Deadly Summer\" (1983).\n- **Fandango at Home Catalog**: Fandango at Home likely has a catalog of Isabelle Adjani's films, but the exact titles and their availability need to be verified. Given her international acclaim, it is reasonable to assume that many of her films are available on major streaming platforms.\n- **\"Possession\" (1981)**: This film is known for its high critical acclaim and has a runtime of 1 hour and 42 minutes, making it a strong candidate.\n- **\"Camille Claudel\" (1988)**: While highly rated, it exceeds the 2-hour limit, so it is not a viable option.\n- **\"One Deadly Summer\" (1983)**: Another critically acclaimed film, but its runtime needs to be verified.\n- **\"La Reine Margot\" (1994)** and **\"Lumière\" (1996)**: These films are also well-regarded and should be checked for runtime and availability.\n\n**New Educated Guess**:\n- **Direct Link Issue**: The direct link to Isabelle Adjani's filmography page (`https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/filmography/`) resulted in a 404 error. This suggests that the URL structure might have changed or there might be a temporary issue with the page. We should try navigating to her main IMDB page and then clicking on the 'Filmography' section instead.\n\n#### **Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses**:\n- **\"Possession\" (1981)**: This film remains a strong candidate due to its high critical acclaim and appropriate runtime.\n- **Direct Link Issue**: The 404 error indicates that the direct link might not be reliable. Navigating through the main IMDB page and then to the 'Filmography' section is a more robust approach.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's Main IMDB Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Isabelle Adjani's main IMDB page: `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/`.\n   - Wait for the page to fully load.\n   - Click on the 'Filmography' section to access the list of her films.\n\n2. **Extract Detailed Information**:\n   - Scroll down to ensure all relevant data is visible.\n   - Extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Filter the films to those that are less than 2 hours long.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - Navigate to Fandango at Home: `https://www.fandango.com/vod`.\n   - Search for each filtered film.\n   - Verify the availability of each film to buy or rent.\n\n4. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - Compare the IMDB ratings of the available films.\n   - Identify the highest-rated film and provide the final answer.\n\n### Example Commands\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's Main IMDB Page**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/\")\n   WebSurfer.wait_for_selector(\"a[data-testid='name-filmography']\")\n   WebSurfer.click(\"a[data-testid='name-filmography']\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Extract Detailed Information**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.scroll_down(3)  # Scroll down to ensure the 'Actress' section is visible\n   filmography = WebSurfer.extract_elements(\"div[data-testid='filmo-row']\")\n   films = []\n   for film in filmography:\n       title = film.find_element(\"a\").text\n       rating = film.find_element(\"span[data-testid='title-rating']\").text\n       runtime = film.find_element(\"span[data-testid='runtime']\").text\n       if int(runtime.split()[0]) < 120:  # Filter films less than 2 hours\n           films.append({\"title\": title, \"rating\": rating, \"runtime\": runtime})\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://www.fandango.com/vod\")\n   available_films = []\n   for film in films:\n       WebSurfer.search(film['title'])\n       WebSurfer.wait_for_selector(\"button[data-testid='rent-or-buy-button']\")\n       availability = WebSurfer.extract_element(\"button[data-testid='rent-or-buy-button']\").text\n       if \"Rent\" in availability or \"Buy\" in availability:\n           available_films.append(film)\n   ```\n\n4. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   ```sh\n   highest_rated_film = max(available_films, key=lambda x: float(x['rating']))\n   print(f\"Highest Rated Film: {highest_rated_film['title']}, Rating: {highest_rated_film['rating']}, Runtime: {highest_rated_film['runtime']}, Available on Fandango at Home\")\n   ```\n\nBy following this updated plan, we should be able to navigate to the correct sections, extract the necessary data, and identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Direct Link**:\n   - The direct link to Isabelle Adjani's filmography page (`https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/filmography/`) resulted in a 404 error, indicating that the URL structure might have changed or there was a temporary issue with the page.\n\n2. **Element Not Found**:\n   - The attempt to click on the 'Filmography' section using the selector `a[data-testid='name-filmography']` failed, likely because the selector was incorrect or the element was not present in the DOM at the time of the interaction.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's Main IMDB Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Isabelle Adjani's main IMDB page: `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/`.\n   - Wait for the page to fully load.\n\n2. **Click on the 'Filmography' Section**:\n   - Use a more robust selector to find and click on the 'Filmography' section. For example, use the text content \"Filmography\" to locate the link.\n   - Wait for the 'Filmography' section to fully load.\n\n3. **Extract Detailed Information**:\n   - Scroll down to ensure all relevant data is visible.\n   - Extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Filter the films to those that are less than 2 hours long.\n\n4. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - Navigate to Fandango at Home: `https://www.fandango.com/vod`.\n   - Search for each filtered film.\n   - Verify the availability of each film to buy or rent.\n\n5. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - Compare the IMDB ratings of the available films.\n   - Identify the highest-rated film and provide the final answer.\n\n### Example Commands\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's Main IMDB Page**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/\")\n   WebSurfer.wait_for_selector(\"a[href='/name/nm0000254/filmography/']\")\n   WebSurfer.click(\"a[href='/name/nm0000254/filmography/']\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Extract Detailed Information**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.scroll_down(3)  # Scroll down to ensure the 'Actress' section is visible\n   filmography = WebSurfer.extract_elements(\"div[data-testid='filmo-row']\")\n   films = []\n   for film in filmography:\n       title = film.find_element(\"a\").text\n       rating = film.find_element(\"span[data-testid='title-rating']\").text\n       runtime = film.find_element(\"span[data-testid='runtime']\").text\n       if int(runtime.split()[0]) < 120:  # Filter films less than 2 hours\n           films.append({\"title\": title, \"rating\": rating, \"runtime\": runtime})\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://www.fandango.com/vod\")\n   available_films = []\n   for film in films:\n       WebSurfer.search(film['title'])\n       WebSurfer.wait_for_selector(\"button[data-testid='rent-or-buy-button']\")\n       availability = WebSurfer.extract_element(\"button[data-testid='rent-or-buy-button']\").text\n       if \"Rent\" in availability or \"Buy\" in availability:\n           available_films.append(film)\n   ```\n\n4. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   ```sh\n   highest_rated_film = max(available_films, key=lambda x: float(x['rating']))\n   print(f\"Highest Rated Film: {highest_rated_film['title']}, Rating: {highest_rated_film['rating']}, Runtime: {highest_rated_film['runtime']}, Available on Fandango at Home\")\n   ```\n\n### Additional Hints\n\n- **Wait for Elements to Load**: Use `WebSurfer.wait_for_selector` to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n- **Use Robust Selectors**: Use multiple attributes or text content to locate elements more reliably.\n- **Scroll and Wait**: Scroll down and wait for the page to load additional content before extracting data.\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to avoid the previous issues and successfully complete the task."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n- The film must be an Isabelle Adjani feature film.\n- The film must have a rating on IMDB.\n- The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n- The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent.\n\n#### 2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n- The IMDB ratings for Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n- The runtime of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n- The availability of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n#### 3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n- The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n#### 4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n- **Isabelle Adjani's Filmography**: Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, but without looking up the specific ratings and runtimes, it's difficult to guess which one would be the highest-rated and under 2 hours. However, some of her well-known films include \"Possession\" (1981), \"Camille Claudel\" (1988), and \"One Deadly Summer\" (1983).\n- **Fandango at Home Catalog**: Fandango at Home likely has a catalog of Isabelle Adjani's films, but the exact titles and their availability need to be verified. Given her international acclaim, it is reasonable to assume that many of her films are available on major streaming platforms.\n- **\"Possession\" (1981)**: This film is known for its high critical acclaim and has a runtime of 1 hour and 42 minutes, making it a strong candidate.\n- **\"Camille Claudel\" (1988)**: While highly rated, it exceeds the 2-hour limit, so it is not a viable option.\n- **\"One Deadly Summer\" (1983)**: Another critically acclaimed film, but its runtime needs to be verified.\n- **\"La Reine Margot\" (1994)** and **\"Lumière\" (1996)**: These films are also well-regarded and should be checked for runtime and availability.\n\n**New Educated Guess**:\n- **Direct Link Issue**: The direct link to Isabelle Adjani's filmography page (`https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/filmography/`) resulted in a 404 error. This suggests that the URL structure might have changed or there might be a temporary issue with the page. We should try navigating to her main IMDB page and then clicking on the 'Filmography' section instead.\n- **Filmography Section Visibility**: The 'Filmography' section is not immediately visible on the main IMDB page. Scrolling down is necessary to ensure the section is in view before clicking.\n\n#### **Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses**:\n- **\"Possession\" (1981)**: This film remains a strong candidate due to its high critical acclaim and appropriate runtime.\n- **Direct Link Issue**: The 404 error indicates that the direct link might not be reliable. Navigating through the main IMDB page and then to the 'Filmography' section is a more robust approach.\n- **Filmography Section Visibility**: Since the 'Filmography' section is not initially visible, scrolling down ensures that the section is in view before attempting to click it.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's Main IMDB Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Isabelle Adjani's main IMDB page: `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/`.\n   - Wait for the page to fully load.\n   - Scroll down to ensure the 'Filmography' section is in view.\n   - Click on the 'Filmography' section to access the list of her films.\n\n2. **Extract Detailed Information**:\n   - Scroll down to ensure all relevant data is visible.\n   - Extract the titles, IMDB ratings, and runtimes of Isabelle Adjani's feature films.\n   - Filter the films to those that are less than 2 hours long.\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   - Navigate to Fandango at Home: `https://www.fandango.com/vod`.\n   - Search for each filtered film.\n   - Verify the availability of each film to buy or rent.\n\n4. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   - Compare the IMDB ratings of the available films.\n   - Identify the highest-rated film and provide the final answer.\n\n### Example Commands\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's Main IMDB Page**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/\")\n   WebSurfer.wait_for_selector(\"a[data-testid='name-filmography']\")\n   WebSurfer.scroll_down(1)  # Scroll down to ensure the 'Filmography' section is in view\n   WebSurfer.click(\"a[data-testid='name-filmography']\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Extract Detailed Information**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.scroll_down(3)  # Scroll down to ensure the 'Actress' section is visible\n   filmography = WebSurfer.extract_elements(\"div[data-testid='filmo-row']\")\n   films = []\n   for film in filmography:\n       title = film.find_element(\"a\").text\n       rating = film.find_element(\"span[data-testid='title-rating']\").text\n       runtime = film.find_element(\"span[data-testid='runtime']\").text\n       if int(runtime.split()[0]) < 120:  # Filter films less than 2 hours\n           films.append({\"title\": title, \"rating\": rating, \"runtime\": runtime})\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Availability on Fandango at Home**:\n   ```sh\n   WebSurfer.navigate(\"https://www.fandango.com/vod\")\n   available_films = []\n   for film in films:\n       WebSurfer.search(film['title'])\n       WebSurfer.wait_for_selector(\"button[data-testid='rent-or-buy-button']\")\n       availability = WebSurfer.extract_element(\"button[data-testid='rent-or-buy-button']\").text\n       if \"Rent\" in availability or \"Buy\" in availability:\n           available_films.append(film)\n   ```\n\n4. **Identify the Highest-Rated Film**:\n   ```sh\n   highest_rated_film = max(available_films, key=lambda x: float(x['rating']))\n   print(f\"Highest Rated Film: {highest_rated_film['title']}, Rating: {highest_rated_film['rating']}, Runtime: {highest_rated_film['runtime']}, Available on Fandango at Home\")\n   ```\n\nBy following this updated plan, we should be able to navigate to the correct sections, extract the necessary data, and identify the highest-rated film that meets all the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Selector for 'Filmography' Section**:\n   - The selector `a[data-testid='name-filmography']` did not match the actual HTML structure of the page, leading to the \"No such element\" error.\n\n2. **Insufficient Scrolling**:\n   - The 'Filmography' section was not immediately visible, and the script did not scroll down enough to bring it into view before attempting to click it.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to Isabelle Adjani's Main IMDB Page**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Isabelle Adjani's main IMDB page: `https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000254/`.\n   - Wait for the page to fully load.\n\n2. **Scroll Down to Ensure 'Filmography' Section is Visible**:\n   - Scroll down the page to ensure the 'Filmography' section is in view.\n   - Use a more robust method to locate and click the 'Filmography' section, such as searching for the text \"Filmography\".\n\n3. **Extract Detailed Information**:\n   -
