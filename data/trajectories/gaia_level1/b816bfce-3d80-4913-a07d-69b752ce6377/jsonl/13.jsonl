{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in a journal named for the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house, what word was quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The article was written by Emily Midkiff.\n   - The article was published in June 2014.\n   - The journal is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The word in question was quoted from two different authors.\n   - The word expresses distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The name of the journal, which is named after one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house.\n   - The specific word quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for dragon depictions.\n   - The identity of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n   - The exact context in which the word was used in the article.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The identity of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house, as mentioned in Norse mythology.\n   - The relevance of the chosen word to the overall theme of the article.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The journal is likely named after Fafnir, one of Hreidmar's sons who is known for transforming into a dragon in Norse mythology.\n   - The word in question might be something like \"cliché,\" \"stereotypical,\" or \"overdone,\" given the context of distaste for dragon depictions.\n   - The authors quoted could be scholars or writers who have critiqued modern or traditional depictions of dragons.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Journal Name**: Use knowledge of Norse mythology to determine the name of Hreidmar's son who guarded his house. This will help identify the journal name.\n- **Search for the Article**: Use WebSurfer to search for Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the identified journal.\n- **Locate the Quoted Word**: Once the article is found, use WebSurfer to locate the specific word quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for dragon depictions.\n- **Identify the Authors**: Note the names of the two authors whose quotes were used.\n- **Summarize Findings**: Compile the information into a clear and concise response, including the journal name, the quoted word, and the authors."}

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children's literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children's literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children's literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons' intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children's literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children's literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"ScholarlyArticle\",\n        \"author\": [\n            {\n                \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Emily Midkiff\",\n                \"url\": \"https://independent.academia.edu/EmilyMidkiff\",\n                \"image\": \"https://0.academia-photos.com/241368800/96358925/85391189/s200_emily.midkiff.jpeg\",\n                \"sameAs\": []\n            }\n        ],\n        \"contributor\": [],\n        \"dateCreated\": \"2023-12-05\",\n        \"datePublished\": \"2014-06-01\",\n        \"headline\": \"\\u201cDragons are Tricksy\\u201d: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\\u2019s Literature\",\n        \"image\": \"https://attachments.academia-assets.com/108389002/thumbnails/1.jpg\",\n        \"inLanguage\": \"en\",\n        \"keywords\": [\n            \"Uncanny\",\n            \"Fafnir\"\n        ],\n        \"publication\": \"Fafnir\",\n        \"publisher\": {\n            \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n            \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n            \"name\": null\n        },\n        \"sourceOrganization\": [\n            {\n                \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n                \"@type\": \"EducationalOrganization\",\n                \"name\": null\n            }\n        ],\n        \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://attachments.academia-assets.com/108389002/thumbnails/1.jpg\",\n        \"url\": \"https://www.academia.edu/110630816/_Dragons_are_Tricksy_The_Uncanny_Dragons_of_Children_s_Literature\"\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n        \"google-site-verification\": \"bKJMBZA7E43xhDOopFZkssMMkBRjvYERV-NaN4R6mrs\",\n        \"csrf-param\": \"authenticity_token\",\n        \"csrf-token\": \"vj_SKxWNvlSKQPBhedo0uH0IH5svs_04wk2fj4CmCsApF7wHeJkZ-dzuIS1_-0rsldmMrhPhK4AwfRUVPKyenw\",\n        \"citation_title\": \"\\u201cDragons are Tricksy\\u201d: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\\u2019s Literature\",\n        \"citation_publication_date\": \"2014/06/01\",\n        \"citation_journal_title\": \"Fafnir\",\n        \"citation_author\": \"Emily Midkiff\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary\",\n        \"twitter:url\": \"https://www.academia.edu/110630816/_Dragons_are_Tricksy_The_Uncanny_Dragons_of_Children_s_Literature\",\n        \"twitter:title\": \"\\u201cDragons are Tricksy\\u201d: The Uncanny Dragons of Children\\u2019s Literature\",\n        \"twitter:description\": \"As early as the sixties, scholars of children&#39;s literature have noted a trend to soften and satirize the dragon for children.

This potential reveals that dragons are \nstill strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a \nFreudian uncanny lens. \nKeywords: Dragon, uncanny, Freud, children’s literature \nBiography and contact info: Emily Midkiff (MA, English and Children's Literature) is teaching and \nworking on her PhD at the University of Minnesota. \nJ.R.R. Tolkien once declared that “the dragon in legend is a potent creation of men’s imagination, \nricher in significance than his barrow is in gold” (“The Monsters” 16). Dragons in mythology have \ncome to be recognized for their value as representations of ancient cultures or as worldwide \narchetypes. Anthropologists have found and studied dragons in nearly all surviving mythologies; \nmedievalists have examined them in manuscripts and bestiaries. In modern literature, dragons have \nflourished in their newer realm of fantasy and children’s literature as one of its most pervasive \nmythic animals. \n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org) \n41 \nEmily Midkiff \nThe Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature \nYet within children’s literature, scholars have noted a trend beginning even before the \ndragon’s mass popularity in fantasy to soften and satirize the dragon for children. While this type of \nfriendly dragon has become a well known resident of children’s books, this article argues that \nchildren’s literature dragons have been not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for \nuncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many \nmodern children’s literature dragons. \nFluffy Dragons \nIn comparison to ancient dragon lore, modern dragons for children inspire less terror and more \nlaughter, beginning most noticeably with Kenneth Grahame’s “The Reluctant Dragon” in 1898. \nRuth Stein in 1968 and Margaret Blount in 1974 both comment with distaste on the increasingly \ncuddly, “fluffy” nature of dragons in children’s literature. In a short article for \nElementary \nEducation\n, Stein expresses hope that Tolkien’s Smaug would improve the literary dragon’s \nevolution and encourage properly scary dragons. While this has since proved true in part, the \nbemoaned fluffy dragons remain prevalent alongside Tolkien’s menacing breed. Nonetheless \nBlount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they \ncould be less than terrifying and still remain “real dragons” (129). She points out several stories that \nfail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally \nHistory Education Research Journal\ndownload\nDownload free PDF\nView PDF\nchevron_right\nBeowulf's Dragon\nShawn L .

Nonetheless \nBlount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they \ncould be less than terrifying and still remain “real dragons” (129). She points out several stories that \nfail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally \nbehave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in \norder to inspire conflict. Jon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a “real” dragon is and \neven praises the proliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame’s dragon, as parodies of the \noutdated cultural codes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223). \nHope Shastri’s 1992 dissertation on the picture book dragon gives concrete results to support \nthe observations of scholars like Stein, Blount, and Stott. Shastri performed a content analysis of \n151 picture books produced between 1950 and 1992 in order to ascertain whether or not dragons \nhave preserved their range of mythic capabilities in that form of children’s literature. She divides \npicture book dragons into three categories: Household (the type that Blount accused of failure), \nWildwood (untamed, living in the wild and closer to Tolkien’s sort), and Imaginary (clearly pretend \nor a dream on the part of a child) and identifies thirty traditional dragon traits such as breathing fire, \nconsuming humans, guarding treasure, talking, flying, and being vanquished. After applying these \ncategories and traits to all 151 books, Shastri concludes that picture book dragons have effectively \nlost the majority of their original mythic qualities, save fire-breathing, and have largely become \ntame and meek—especially the Household dragons, out of which she finds 86% to be denatured as \nopposed to 34% of Wildwood and 42% of Imaginary dragons (77). Tina L. Hanlon generally agrees \nwith Shastri’s findings in her own examination of 100 picture books in 2003, but she also notes with \nsome hope the resurgence of strong dragons in retold fairy tales. In total, the work of these scholars \nover the past two decades indicates that dragons in children’s books are increasingly humorous and \nless and less fearsome, just as Stein feared when she wrote over forty years ago. \nDragons and the Uncanny \nThere may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than these observations and \nstudies indicate, due to one significant aspect of Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast \nby a dragon. The traits listed by Shastri focus on characteristics of the dragons themselves but do \nnot include the emotional environment created by the dragon within the literature or with the \naudience.

Joyce Tally Lionarons and Jonathan \nEvans, scholars of medieval dragon-lore, assert that dragons such as the famous Fáfnir were \nterrifying and effective characters in epics because they vied with people for the right to be \n“human.” According to the classic definition by Freud, the uncanny double occurs when “one \n[person] possesses knowledge, feelings and experience in common with the other” and is also \nsometimes “marked by the fact that the subject identifies himself with someone else, so that he is in \ndoubt as to which his self is, or substitutes the extraneous self for his own” (234). \n1 \nFreudian \npsychoanalysis has been applied to dragons in fairy tales by such scholars as Bruno Bettelheim, but \nhe posits dragons as the dangerous, untamed id or the projection of oedipal issues by the child hero \n(76). Bettelheim’s analysis also locates dragons as an internal hero conflict, which in many ways \ncomplements to my argument here, but I focus on Freud’s concept of the uncanny rather than his \nsuperego-ego-id construct to explain the way that modern dragons can still unsettle readers even \nwhen the plot does not follow the traditional human hero questing to slay a physically fearsome \ndragon. Modern tamed and human-like children’s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny \nqualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not life or ego-threatening \ncharacters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire the uncanny doubling with \nhumans: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. \nThe remainder of this article will further explain how the dragon’s potent powers of vision \nand language operate as uncanny traits, how vision and language are recognized by scholars of \nGermanic dragon-lore, and how these traits were translated into children’s literature through such \nlandmark texts as Grahame’s \nThe Reluctant Dragon \nand J.R.R. Tolkien’s Smaug in \nThe Hobbit \n(1937). Finally, I will examine some examples of the uncanny vision and language of the dragons of \nmodern children’s literature through the middle-grade reader \nHow to Train Your Dragon Vol. 1 \nand \nthe picture book \nHush, Little Dragon\n. These books serve as purposeful case studies intended to \nrepresent recent English-language literature for the youngest to middle-grade readers. Each book \nwas selected out of a pool of potential recent dragon books because they represent clear, but not \nextraordinary or unusual, examples of tamed and human-like dragons, respectively. I mean to \nultimately use these texts to demonstrate that while many commonplace modern dragons have \nevolved away from their ancestors to good or bad effect, the visual potency and intimacy with \nlanguage inherited from older dragons remain a potent, if largely invisible, means of creating \nuncanny dragons in children’s literature. Stein and Blount protest the appearance of increasingly \nhuman dragons, but this very doubling has the potential to rescue the awe of dragons as long as they \nare just different and frightening enough to achieve the uncanny. \n1 \nAdmittedly, Freud dismisses fantastic tales as potential hosts for the uncanny, saying “I cannot think of any genuine fairy story \nwhich has anything uncanny about it” (246). However, many scholars before me have disregarded this qualification of the uncanny \nand applied it to fantasy and fairy tales alike. See Peter Straub’s “American Fantastic Tales: Terror and the Uncanny from Poe to the \nPulps” for an overview of the uncanny in fantastic American stories or David Rudd’s “An Eye for an I: Neil Gaiman's Coraline and \nQuestions of Identity” for a more specific application of Freud’s uncanny to a fantasy text. \n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org) \n43 \nLion Kings or puppies: The influence of fantasy on children's understanding of pretense\nAngeline LillardDevelopmental Science, 1999\ndownload\nDownload free PDF\nView PDF\nchevron_right\nFASTITOCALON Studies in Fantasticism Ancient to Modern Vol. VI · 2016 FANTASTIC ANIMALS, ANIMALS IN THE FANTASTIC Issue 1 & 2\nTziona Grossmarkdownload\nDownload free PDF\nView PDF\nchevron_right\nAnimals and Emotions in Medieval German Literature: The Various Functions of Bestial Imagery in the Staging of Emotions\nSandra HofertAestimatio, 2024\ndownload\nDownload free PDF\nView PDF\nchevron_right\nDragon-Ridden\" Days: Yeats, Apocalypse, and the Anthropocene\nMalcolm SenInternational Yeats Studies\ndownload\nDownload free PDF\nView PDF\nchevron_right\nRepresenting Beasts in Early Medieval England and Scandinavia ed. by Michael D.

In Freud’s \nconcept of the uncanny, the eyes are a frequent site of fear in two ways: as a displaced castration \ncomplex if the eyes are threatened, and as the evil-eye threatening oneself (231, 240). Colloquially \nconsidered windows to the soul, the eyes are also a significant cultural location for human identity. \nLikewise, the dragon’s powerful eyes are one of its identifying features and greatest assets in its \nefforts to seize human identity. When discussing the Indo-European name for the dragon, Jonathan \nEvans says that the Greek root “*drk-” originally means “to see, to watch” and “*drk-on” would \nmean something like “seeing one” (“As Rare” 23). Evans asserts that accordingly many \nIndo-European dragons are watchers and guarders responsible for keeping an eye on a treasure of \nsome sort, and many have piercing or unnatural stares to discomfit potential attackers (23). The \nGreek dragon’s name and identity is based on its power of sight. The “unnatural” stare that Evans \nmentions also creates an eerie sense of the intelligence behind the dragon’s guardianship, a power \nand vision comparable if not superior to humanity’s. The human hero is responsible for guarding the \npeople, the dragon for guarding the treasure. Until one defeats the other, they are equally identified \nas powerful over-seers threatening one another’s guardianship. Traditionally, when a hero faces and \ndefeats a dragon, the slaying extinguishes the dragon’s superior vision. In doing so, the hero \nestablishes himself as the greater power and superior identity as watcher-guardian. This challenge \nover the hero’s watcher-identity invokes the Freudian evil-eye or blindness as castration, making the \ndragon’s threat to one’s identity as watcher-guardian uncanny. \nAlongside the eyes, the dragon’s uncanny powers manifest in its associations with speech. \nAs far as we know, dragons are primarily imaginary creatures that emerged from within the oral and \nwritten realms of storytelling. \n2 \nIn Western literature, they leapt into being as an invention of \nlanguage and shortly after acquired, within stories, the ability to out-speak humans. \n3 \nIn creating \nlanguage-capable monsters proficient with the tools of linguistic creation, poets and bards fashioned \nin dragons a double for themselves: the dragon as wielder of language and the raw potential for \nlanguage—including the risk that language could escape human control and become dangerous. In \nthis way dragons stole the human invention that created them and ventured uncomfortably close to \nhumanity through the ability to speak with equal or superior eloquence. While other animals speak \nin legend and fairy tale, most of these creatures existed before language named them, and their \nwords are simple and communicative. \nDragons in contrast could not exist without language, and \nhave a high language skill demonstrated through fondness for riddling talk and a tendency to use it \naggressively. \n4 \nFurthermore, traditional dragons are notoriously evil where regular animals are not. \nDeirdre Dwen Pitts writes that folklore animals \n“date from the time when the world was not yet \nman-oriented and man and animal struggled together against uncontrollable natural forces” (169). \nThese animals are on the humans’ side: “Animals are rarely the antagonists in these tales; enemies \nare usually undefined monsters, ogres, witches, giants, devils, demons, with only an occasional \nwolf” (169). Oddly missing from this list are dragons, which are also frequent enemies and shadows \nof humanity. The dragon is, like the uncanny, that which “ought to have remained secret and hidden \nbut has come to light” (Freud 225). Many of the most terrifying and memorable dragons rely on \n2 \nSee Grafton Elliot Smith’s \nThe Evolution of the Dragon\n, Charles Gould’s \nDragons, Unicorns, and Sea Serpents: A Classic \nStudy of the Evidence for their Existence \n, Ernest Ingersoll’s \nDragons and Dragon Lore\n, and David E.

It is \nat this point that the dragon’s relationship with language becomes noticeable and also problematic. \n4 \nThe sphinx and trolls, other frequently riddling creatures, are recognized as proto-dragons. See the work of Charles Gould \nand Ernest Ingersoll in works cited. \n44 \n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org) \nEmily Midkiff \nISSN: 2342-2009 \nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 41–54 \ntheir use of language to inspire fear and awe due to being distinctly unwelcome doubles for \nhumanity. \nAlthough the dragon may imitate humanity through its roles as watcher and speaker, its \nphysical properties keep it unfamiliar enough to be uncanny. The dragon’s appearance comes down \nas inconsistent through European lore, but the medieval dragon is never nice-looking or \naesthetically pleasing. This traditional dragon combines frightening and uncomfortable aspects \ntaken from beasts who threaten humanity: snakes, big cats, and birds of prey. \n5 \nTherefore when this \nundesirable anti-human claims human identity, the thought becomes inherently unsettling to \nhumans. Having this conglomeration of everything that one finds frightening and uncomfortable \nnearly become the same as oneself produces the uncanny doubling effect. Furthermore, Freud \nsuggests that the familiar unfamiliar of the uncanny is the result of repressed experiences (241); \naccordingly many of these old stories imply that the dragon embodies the repressed dark side of the \nhero. \nIn the medieval Germanic dragon myths, the dragon watching over a hoard becomes an \nuncanny double for the hero watching over the people. In \nBeowulf\n, the poet uses identical words to \ndescribe the roles of Beowulf and the dragon. At different times he calls them both \naglæcan\n, \nmeaning “warrior,” and only context distinguishes the hero from the dragon (Lionarons 30). The \nsame phrase \nhordweard \nor “hoard-guardian” refers to both. The dragon’s lair is called a \ndryhtsele\n, \nthe term used for a human king’s hall (30). These examples of parallel naming reveal the doubled \nnatures of hero and dragon as well as their conflicting positions. They perform the same job, but \nonly one can succeed. In the inevitable conflict, the two guardians are so similar they nearly cancel \none another out. Both kill one another; only narrowly does Beowulf come out on top as the \nsuccessful overseer. By killing the dragon, he proves an effective guardian of his people from the \ndragon menace, but he also performs the final viewing and therefore possession of the dragon’s \ntreasure. The two concepts are connected, as the poet shows through Beowulf’s insistence upon \nseeing the treasure before dying. When Wiglaf brings it to him, Beowulf gazes on it and says, “I \ngive thanks / that I behold this treasure here in front of me, / that I have been allowed to leave my \npeople / so well endowed on the day I die” (ln 2795-2798). He believes the treasure he has won \ncould support his people, and therefore what the dragon has been watching over has been converted \nto a part of Beowulf’s ward. His ability to look on the treasure assures him that he has won the \nbattle of eyes. \nThe language of the Germanic dragons also doubled them with humans, and in two ways: \nthe way that the dragons were spoken about and the way that they spoke. Aside from how similar \nwords are used in \nBeowulf \nto align the hero and the dragon, the Indo-European dragon-slaying myth\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Aside from how similar \nwords are used in \nBeowulf \nto align the hero and the dragon, the Indo-European dragon-slaying myth \nhas its own special verb formula reserved for the epic killing of dragons. In her book on medieval \ndragons, Lionarons points out that instead of an active verb such as “to slay,” the dragon-slaying \nverb is self-reflexive and roughly translates “to become slayer to” (6). The action of slaying defines \nthe hero/slayer against the dragon/slain. The way this particular verb functions, Lionarons notes, \n“suggests a covert similarity between subject and object, hero and dragon” (6). The cosmic \ndragon-slaying myth and later the legendary hero tale, she explains, worked through one voice \nsilencing the other—the battle is over language since the winner gets to declare himself to be the \ngod/hero and the loser to be the dragon (8). The need for such a battle reveals the uncomfortable \nsimilarity between heroes and dragons in the tales of dragon-slayers such as Sigurd, \nÞ\niđrek, \nBeowulf, and Thor. Each hero ultimately defines himself as the hero; it is the narrow margin of \nsuccess and uncertain hero status that creates the uncanniness. \n5 \nSmith uses this combination of predator traits as the foundation for his theory that dragons result from residual \npredator-prey instincts left over from the evolution of humanity. In his book, he details how these attributes are present in \nevery mythological dragon in every culture across the world. \n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org) \n45 \nEmily Midkiff \nThe Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature \nThe dragons also use language to fight for the speaking, dominant role, as can be seen in the \nverbal battle that occurs at the death of the dragon Fáfnir. In the \nVolsunga Saga \nversion, the hero \nSigurd kills Fáfnir through a trick; the actual violence is brief. As the dragon slowly dies, it speaks \n(\nVolsunga \n78). Lionarons claims that the conversation is riskier than the attack, for despite Fáfnir’s \nmortal wounds, he threatens to take the winner’s right as silencer through engaging the Germanic \ngenres of the \nsenna\n, death song, and wisdom poetry (69). The \nsenna \nis a stylized battle of words \naccomplished through ritual insults and challenges meant to establish one’s social place. When \nFáfnir engages Sigurd in this battle, as Armann Jakobsson puts it, “readers will be prone to an eerie \nfeeling that the dragon is somehow outwitting Sigurđr” (31). This eerie feeling results from a \ndistinctly non-human entity fighting for the human social rank of hero, and doing well. The \ndragon’s skill at word-play indicates that the non-human may actually be better at the human’s \ngame of language. Fáfnir nearly wins through wisdom poetry that touches on the cosmological and \nsilences the hero. Sigurd, in his efforts to outsmart Fáfnir and find an unanswerable question, asks \nabout the end of the world: “How namest thou the holm whereon Surt and the Æsir mix and mingle \nin the water of the sword?” (\nVolsung \n80) Surt, the fire giant, is fated to destroy the world at \nRagnarok in a battle against the Æsir. The beginning and the end of the world in Norse myth \nrevolve around the conquering and resurgence of chaos, embodied in part by the Midgard Serpent, \nJormungandr, the immense dragon that was defeated at the world’s creation by Thor and will in turn \ndefeat Thor at Ragnarok. In asking about the cosmic end, Sigurd questions the farthest reaches of \nwisdom and speech, being and non-being, and the cosmic battle of dragon and hero, which he is \nre-enacting in miniature. Fáfnir replies, in many translations: “Unshapen is that holm hight,” or the \nisland is not named (80). In the original Icelandic, he calls the island “Oskopnir” (Hunt).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Fáfnir replies, in many translations: “Unshapen is that holm hight,” or the \nisland is not named (80). In the original Icelandic, he calls the island “Oskopnir” (Hunt). \nTranslations of the “The Lay of Fafnir” from the Elder Edda often phrase the reply: “Oskopnir it is \ncalled” (174). August Hunt claims that translating the word as a mere lack of name misrepresents it. \nThe –nir is a basic Icelandic suffix, but combined with Oskop-, meaning “umade,” it could instead \nindicate the “island of unmaking” (Hunt). Therefore the island could be not yet made, not yet \nnamed, or the place of the final unmaking. Possibly all three at once, straining the human mind to \nembrace the dragon’s polysemic phrasing. Fáfnir’s bewildering understanding and deft verbal \nexpression of cosmic knowledge hushes Sigurd. The dragon’s next words, Lionarons claims, change \nfrom wisdom poetry to a death song—a genre reserved for dying heroes. Sigurd interrupts and \nsteers them back into the \nsenna, \nnarrowly getting the last word and walking away with his victory \nand identity as the hero intact. This threatening similarity between Sigurd and Fáfnir exemplifies \nthe speaking dragon’s uncanny ability to become the supreme double and threat to humanity. \nFrom Victorian Satire to Modern Fantasy \nFollowing the medieval surge of Christianity in Europe, the Germanic legends of Western dragons \nbecame inextricably tied to the Devil-dragon of Revelation and far too allegorical for use in \ncommon secular stories, according to Ruth Berman. Not until the late 1800’s, with the discoveries \nof dinosaur remains, were dragons tenable outside of allegory (Berman 220). At that point, Berman \nclaims, Kenneth Grahame’s lighthearted, secular story “The Reluctant Dragon” in 1898 helped \nresurrect the dragon from its allegorical existence. Grahame’s was a carefree and satirical dragon— \nfar removed from the heavy religious matter of Revelation. Grahame’s version retained only subtle \ntraces of the dragon’s menacing eyes and language and made his dragon prefer poetry or being a \nspectacle over fighting. Again, a human hero of the tale, the shepherd’s boy, doubles the dragon in \nthat he also writes poetry, “heaps of it” in fact, and would very much like to watch a spectacle \n(335). The dragon and the boy differ though, when it comes to violence. The dragon prefers \ngrammar and chastises the boy: “Don’t be \nviolent\n, Boy, . . .

In a short article for \nElementary \nEducation\n, Stein expresses hope that Tolkien’s Smaug would improve the literary dragon’s \nevolution and encourage properly scary dragons. While this has since proved true in part, the \nbemoaned fluffy dragons remain prevalent alongside Tolkien’s menacing breed. Nonetheless \nBlount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they \ncould be less than terrifying and still remain “real dragons” (129). She points out several stories that \nfail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally \nbehave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in \norder to inspire conflict. \n47 \n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org) \nEmily Midkiff \nISSN: 2342-2009 \nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 41–54 \nJon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a “real” dragon is and even praises the \nproliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame’s dragon, as parodies of the outdated cultural \ncodes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223). \nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>\n\nBased on the text, the word quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions is **\"cuddly\"**.
