{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat time was the Tri-Rail train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019 scheduled to arrive in Pompano Beach? Express your answer in the 12-hour digital clock format without leading zero if any, and include whether it is AM or PM.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The date in question is May 27, 2019.\n   - The location of interest is Pompano Beach.\n   - The transportation method is a Tri-Rail train.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The schedule of Tri-Rail trains for May 27, 2019.\n   - The specific train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019.\n   - The scheduled arrival time of the train that carried the most passengers in Pompano Beach.\n   - These details can be found in historical records or archives of Tri-Rail schedules and passenger data, which might be available on the Tri-Rail official website, transportation department records, or news articles covering the event.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019, by comparing the passenger counts of different trains.\n   - The corresponding scheduled arrival time for that train in Pompano Beach.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on typical commuter patterns, a train that carries the most passengers might be one that runs during peak hours, such as morning or evening rush hours.\n   - The arrival time could be around 5:00 PM or 8:00 PM, assuming these are common times for high passenger volume. However, this is speculative and needs verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: Search for historical Tri-Rail schedules and passenger data for May 27, 2019.\n- **WebSurfer**: Identify the specific train that carried the most passengers on that day.\n- **WebSurfer**: Find the scheduled arrival time of that train in Pompano Beach.\n- **Assistant**: Verify the time format and ensure it is in the 12-hour digital clock format without leading zeros and includes AM or PM.\n- **Assistant**: Provide the final answer based on the information gathered."}

Express your answer in the 12-hour digital clock format without leading zero if any, and include whether it is AM or PM.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser.

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The date in question is May 27, 2019.\n   - The location of interest is Pompano Beach.\n   - The transportation method is a Tri-Rail train.\n   - Tri-Rail set a ridership record in 2019, carrying 4,495,039 passengers, according to news articles and official reports.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The detailed historical schedule of Tri-Rail trains for May 27, 2019.\n   - The specific train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019.\n   - The scheduled arrival time of the train that carried the most passengers in Pompano Beach.\n   - Historical records or archives of Tri-Rail schedules and passenger data for May 27, 2019, which might be available on the Tri-Rail official website, transportation department records, or news articles covering the event.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019, by comparing the passenger counts of different trains.\n   - The corresponding scheduled arrival time for that train in Pompano Beach.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on typical commuter patterns, a train that carries the most passengers might be one that runs during peak hours, such as morning or evening rush hours.\n   - The arrival time could be around 5:00 PM or 8:00 PM, assuming these are common times for high passenger volume. However, this is speculative and needs verification.\n   - Given that May 27, 2019, was a Monday, it is likely that the train with the highest passenger count was during the evening rush hour, as many commuters return home after work.\n   - The Tri-Rail website and customer service might have archived data or reports from 2019 that could provide the specific train and its schedule for May 27, 2019.\n\n**NEXT STEPS:**\n- Contact Tri-Rail customer service directly to inquire about the historical schedule and passenger data for May 27, 2019.\n- Check the Tri-Rail website for any archived schedules or reports from 2019.\n- Search for any news articles or press releases from 2019 that might mention specific train schedules or passenger counts for Tri-Rail.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Lack of Specific Historical Data:** The search queries did not yield specific historical schedules and passenger data for May 27, 2019. The results were too broad and did not provide the detailed information needed.\n- **Ineffective Search Strategies:** The search terms used were not precise enough to find the exact data required. General searches for \"Tri-Rail historical schedules and passenger data 2019\" did not narrow down to the specific date and train.\n- **Limited Exploration of Official Resources:** The official Tri-Rail website and customer service were not thoroughly explored for historical data and specific train schedules.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Refine Search Queries:**\n  - Use more specific search terms such as \"Tri-Rail schedule May 27, 2019\" and \"Tri-Rail passenger data May 27, 2019.\"\n  - Include terms like \"historical,\" \"archive,\" and \"records\" to find more detailed and specific data.\n\n- **Explore Official Resources:**\n  - Navigate to the official Tri-Rail website and look for sections like \"Archives,\" \"Historical Data,\" or \"Annual Reports.\"\n  - Check if there is a \"Contact Us\" or \"Customer Service\" section to inquire about historical schedules and passenger data for May 27, 2019.\n\n- **Use WebSurfer More Effectively:**\n  - Perform a more detailed exploration of the Tri-Rail website, including all sub-pages and sections.\n  - Use the site's search function to look for specific keywords related to the date and data needed.\n  - Scroll through search results and click on relevant links to find the specific train and its schedule.\n\n- **Contact Customer Service:**\n  - Use the contact information provided on the Tri-Rail website to send an email or make a phone call inquiring about the historical schedule and passenger data for May 27, 2019.\n  - Prepare a clear and concise message explaining the specific information needed.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries:**\n   - WebSurfer: Search for \"Tri-Rail schedule May 27, 2019\" and \"Tri-Rail passenger data May 27, 2019.\"\n   - WebSurfer: Include terms like \"historical,\" \"archive,\" and \"records\" in the search queries.\n\n2. **Explore Official Resources:**\n   - WebSurfer: Navigate to the official Tri-Rail website (https://www.tri-rail.com/).\n   - WebSurfer: Look for sections like \"Archives,\" \"Historical Data,\" or \"Annual Reports.\"\n   - WebSurfer: Use the site's search function to look for specific keywords related to the date and data needed.\n\n3. **Use WebSurfer More Effectively:**\n   - WebSurfer: Scroll through search results and click on relevant links to find the specific train and its schedule.\n   - WebSurfer: Summarize the content of relevant pages to identify the specific train and its scheduled arrival time in Pompano Beach.\n\n4. **Contact Customer Service:**\n   - WebSurfer: Navigate to the \"Contact Us\" or \"Customer Service\" section on the Tri-Rail website.\n   - WebSurfer: Send an email or make a phone call inquiring about the historical schedule and passenger data for May 27, 2019.\n   - Prepare a clear and concise message explaining the specific information needed.\n\n5. **Verify and Format the Answer:**\n   - Assistant: Once the specific train and its scheduled arrival time are identified, verify the time format and ensure it is in the 12-hour digital clock format without leading zeros and includes AM or PM.\n   - Assistant: Provide the final answer based on the information gathered.\n\nBy following this new plan, we should be able to find the specific train and its scheduled arrival time in Pompano Beach for May 27, 2019."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat time was the Tri-Rail train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019 scheduled to arrive in Pompano Beach? Express your answer in the 12-hour digital clock format without leading zero if any, and include whether it is AM or PM.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The date in question is May 27, 2019.\n   - The location of interest is Pompano Beach.\n   - The transportation method is a Tri-Rail train.\n   - Tri-Rail set a ridership record in 2019, carrying 4,495,039 passengers, according to news articles and official reports.\n   - The official Tri-Rail website (https://www.tri-rail.com/) has sections for schedules, news, and reports, but does not readily provide historical schedules or specific passenger data for individual dates.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The detailed historical schedule of Tri-Rail trains for May 27, 2019.\n   - The specific train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019.\n   - The scheduled arrival time of the train that carried the most passengers in Pompano Beach.\n   - Historical records or archives of Tri-Rail schedules and passenger data for May 27, 2019, which might be available through customer service, transportation department records, or news articles covering the event.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019, by comparing the passenger counts of different trains.\n   - The corresponding scheduled arrival time for that train in Pompano Beach.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on typical commuter patterns, a train that carries the most passengers might be one that runs during peak hours, such as morning or evening rush hours.\n   - The arrival time could be around 5:00 PM or 8:00 PM, assuming these are common times for high passenger volume. However, this is speculative and needs verification.\n   - Given that May 27, 2019, was a Monday, it is likely that the train with the highest passenger count was during the evening rush hour, as many commuters return home after work.\n   - The Tri-Rail website and customer service might have archived data or reports from 2019 that could provide the specific train and its schedule for May 27, 2019. However, these data points are not easily accessible through the website's current structure.\n\n**NEXT STEPS:**\n- **Contact Tri-Rail Customer Service:**\n  - Use the contact information provided on the Tri-Rail website (1-800-TRI-RAIL or TTY 711) to inquire about the historical schedule and passenger data for May 27, 2019.\n  - Prepare a clear and concise message explaining the specific information needed, such as the train schedule and passenger data for the date in question.\n\n- **Check Additional Resources:**\n  - Search for any news articles or press releases from 2019 that might mention specific train schedules or passenger counts for Tri-Rail.\n  - Explore other transportation department records or archives that might have the required historical data.\n\n- **Use WebSurfer More Effectively:**\n  - Perform a more detailed exploration of the Tri-Rail website, including all sub-pages and sections.\n  - Use the site's search function to look for specific keywords related to the date and data needed.\n  - Scroll through search results and click on relevant links to find the specific train and its schedule.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to gather the necessary information to determine the scheduled arrival time of the Tri-Rail train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019, in Pompano Beach.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Timeout Errors:** The web surfing attempts encountered timeout errors, indicating that the pages took too long to load or the interactions were not completed within the expected timeframe.\n- **Ineffective Navigation:** The navigation to the 'Schedules' and 'News' sections did not yield the specific historical data needed, possibly due to the website's structure or the lack of direct links to the required information.\n- **Lack of Direct Access to Historical Data:** The Tri-Rail website does not seem to have a straightforward way to access historical schedules and passenger data for specific dates.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Perform a more targeted search using specific keywords like \"Tri-Rail historical schedule May 27, 2019\" and \"Tri-Rail passenger data May 27, 2019.\"\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use advanced search operators (e.g., `site:tri-rail.com` and `intitle:\"historical schedule\"`).\n\n2. **Explore Official Resources Thoroughly:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the 'News' and 'Reports' sections on the Tri-Rail website.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use the site's search function to look for specific keywords related to the date and data needed.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Scroll through search results and click on relevant links to find the specific train and its schedule.\n\n3. **Contact Customer Service:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the 'Contact Us' or 'Customer Service' section on the Tri-Rail website.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Send an email or make a phone call inquiring about the historical schedule and passenger data for May 27, 2019.\n   - **Prepare a Clear Message:** Explain the specific information needed, such as the train schedule and passenger data for the date in question.\n\n4. **Use WebSurfer More Effectively:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Ensure that the page is fully loaded before attempting to interact with it. Use the `sleep` function if necessary.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Take screenshots of relevant sections to ensure that the data is captured correctly.\n\n5. **Verify and Format the Answer:**\n   - **Assistant:** Once the specific train and its scheduled arrival time are identified, verify the time format and ensure it is in the 12-hour digital clock format without leading zeros and includes AM or PM.\n   - **Assistant:** Provide the final answer based on the information gathered.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Search for \"Tri-Rail historical schedule May 27, 2019\" and \"Tri-Rail passenger data May 27, 2019.\"\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use advanced search operators like `site:tri-rail.com` and `intitle:\"historical schedule\"`.\n\n2. **Explore Official Resources Thoroughly:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the 'News' and 'Reports' sections on the Tri-Rail website.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use the site's search function to look for specific keywords related to the date and data needed.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Scroll through search results and click on relevant links to find the specific train and its schedule.\n\n3. **Contact Customer Service:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the 'Contact Us' or 'Customer Service' section on the Tri-Rail website.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Send an email or make a phone call inquiring about the historical schedule and passenger data for May 27, 2019.\n   - **Prepare a Clear Message:** Explain the specific information needed, such as the train schedule and passenger data for the date in question.\n\n4. **Use WebSurfer More Effectively:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Ensure that the page is fully loaded before interacting with it.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat time was the Tri-Rail train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019 scheduled to arrive in Pompano Beach? Express your answer in the 12-hour digital clock format without leading zero if any, and include whether it is AM or PM.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with new insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The date in question is May 27, 2019.\n   - The location of interest is Pompano Beach.\n   - The transportation method is a Tri-Rail train.\n   - Tri-Rail set a ridership record in 2019, carrying 4,495,039 passengers, according to news articles and official reports.\n   - The official Tri-Rail website (https://www.tri-rail.com/) has sections for schedules, news, and reports, but does not readily provide historical schedules or specific passenger data for individual dates.\n   - The contact information for Tri-Rail Customer Service is 1-800-TRI-RAIL (874-7245) or TTY 711 (1-800-955-8771).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The detailed historical schedule of Tri-Rail trains for May 27, 2019.\n   - The specific train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019.\n   - The scheduled arrival time of the train that carried the most passengers in Pompano Beach.\n   - Historical records or archives of Tri-Rail schedules and passenger data for May 27, 2019, which might be available through customer service, transportation department records, or news articles covering the event.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The exact train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019, by comparing the passenger counts of different trains.\n   - The corresponding scheduled arrival time for that train in Pompano Beach.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on typical commuter patterns, a train that carries the most passengers might be one that runs during peak hours, such as morning or evening rush hours.\n   - The arrival time could be around 5:00 PM or 8:00 PM, assuming these are common times for high passenger volume. However, this is speculative and needs verification.\n   - Given that May 27, 2019, was a Monday, it is likely that the train with the highest passenger count was during the evening rush hour, as many commuters return home after work.\n   - The Tri-Rail website and customer service might have archived data or reports from 2019 that could provide the specific train and its schedule for May 27, 2019. However, these data points are not easily accessible through the website's current structure.\n   - **New Guess:** The train that carried the most passengers might be one of the later evening trains, possibly around 6:00 PM or 7:00 PM, as these times often see a high volume of commuters returning home after work.\n\n### NEXT STEPS:\n1. **Contact Tri-Rail Customer Service:**\n   - Use the contact information provided on the Tri-Rail website (1-800-TRI-RAIL or TTY 711) to inquire about the historical schedule and passenger data for May 27, 2019.\n   - Prepare a clear and concise message explaining the specific information needed, such as the train schedule and passenger data for the date in question.\n\n2. **Check Additional Resources:**\n   - Search for any news articles or press releases from 2019 that might mention specific train schedules or passenger counts for Tri-Rail.\n   - Explore other transportation department records or archives that might have the required historical data.\n\n3. **Use WebSurfer More Effectively:**\n   - Perform a more detailed exploration of the Tri-Rail website, including all sub-pages and sections.\n   - Use the site's search function to look for specific keywords related to the date and data needed.\n   - Scroll through search results and click on relevant links to find the specific train and its schedule.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. **Contact Tri-Rail Customer Service:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the 'Contact Us' or 'Customer Service' section on the Tri-Rail website.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Send an email or make a phone call inquiring about the historical schedule and passenger data for May 27, 2019.\n   - **Prepare a Clear Message:** Explain the specific information needed, such as the train schedule and passenger data for the date in question.\n\n2. **Check Additional Resources:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search using specific keywords like \"Tri-Rail historical schedule May 27, 2019\" and \"Tri-Rail passenger data May 27, 2019.\"\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use advanced search operators like `site:tri-rail.com` and `intitle:\"historical schedule\"`.\n\n3. **Use WebSurfer More Effectively:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Ensure that the page is fully loaded before interacting with it. Use the `sleep` function if necessary.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Take screenshots of relevant sections to ensure that the data is captured correctly.\n\n4. **Verify and Format the Answer:**\n   - **Assistant:** Once the specific train and its scheduled arrival time are identified, verify the time format and ensure it is in the 12-hour digital clock format without leading zeros and includes AM or PM.\n   - **Assistant:** Provide the final answer based on the information gathered.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to gather the necessary information to determine the scheduled arrival time of the Tri-Rail train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019, in Pompano Beach.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Repetitive Navigation:** The previous attempts involved repeatedly navigating to the same sections of the Tri-Rail website without making significant progress.\n- **Lack of Specificity in Searches:** The web searches were not specific enough to yield the required historical data.\n- **Ineffective Use of WebSurfer:** The WebSurfer was not used effectively to navigate through the website and extract the necessary information.\n- **Failure to Contact Customer Service:** Despite identifying the need to contact customer service, the actual step to do so was not executed.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Web Searches:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Perform a more targeted web search using specific keywords and advanced search operators.\n     - Search for \"Tri-Rail historical schedule May 27, 2019 site:tri-rail.com intitle:'historical schedule'\".\n     - Use additional keywords like \"Tri-Rail ridership data May 27, 2019\" and \"Tri-Rail most passengers May 27, 2019\".\n\n2. **Explore Tri-Rail Website Thoroughly:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the 'News' and 'Reports' sections on the Tri-Rail website.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use the site's search function to look for specific keywords related to the date and data needed.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Scroll through search results and click on relevant links to find the specific train and its schedule.\n\n3. **Contact Customer Service:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the 'Contact Us' or 'Customer Service' section on the Tri-Rail website.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Send an email or make a phone call inquiring about the historical schedule and passenger data for May 27, 2019.\n   - **Prepare a Clear Message:** Explain the specific information needed, such as the train schedule and passenger data for the date in question.\n\n4. **Use WebSurfer More Effectively:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Ensure that the page is fully loaded before interacting with it. Use the `sleep` function if necessary.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Take screenshots of relevant sections to ensure that the data is captured correctly.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Summarize the entire page or answer questions based on the content of the page to extract the necessary information.\n\n5. **Verify and Format the Answer:**\n   - **Assistant:** Once the specific train and its scheduled arrival time are identified, verify the time format and ensure it is in the 12-hour digital clock format without leading zeros and includes AM or PM.\n   - **Assistant:** Provide the final answer based on the information gathered.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Refine Web Searches:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Search for \"Tri-Rail historical schedule May 27, 2019 site:tri-rail.com intitle:'historical schedule'\".\n   - **WebSurfer:** Search for \"Tri-Rail ridership data May 27, 2019\".\n   - **WebSurfer:** Search for \"Tri-Rail most passengers May 27, 2019\".\n\n2. **Explore Tri-Rail Website Thoroughly:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the 'News' section on the Tri-Rail website.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use the site's search function to look for \"historical schedule May 27, 2019\".\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the 'Reports' section on the Tri-Rail website.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use the site's search function to look for \"ridership data May 27, 2019\".\n\n3. **Contact Customer Service:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Navigate to the 'Contact Us' section on the Tri-Rail website.\n   - **WebSurfer:** Send an email to the customer service with the following message:\n     ```\n     Subject: Historical Schedule and Passenger Data for May 27, 2019\n\n     Dear Tri-Rail Customer Service,\n\n     I am writing to inquire about the historical schedule and passenger data for May 27, 2019.
