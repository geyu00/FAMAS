Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about Ted Danson.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Rotten Tomatoes ratings for all series Ted Danson has starred in.\n- Which series with more than 1 season Ted Danson has starred in.\n- Availability of these series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- Rotten Tomatoes score of each series to determine the worst-rated.\n  \n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Comparison of Rotten Tomatoes scores to determine the worst-rated series.\n- Matching the availability on Amazon Prime Video with the list of worst-rated series.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Ted Danson is widely known for popular shows such as \"Cheers\", \"The Good Place\", and \"CSI\". A less popular series could potentially have a lower rating.\n\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is a short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n- Use WebSurfer to search for a list of series that Ted Danson has starred in and confirm which of those have more than 1 season.\n- Find the Rotten Tomatoes scores for each of those series.\n- Determine which of those series are available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- Identify the worst-rated series (according to Rotten Tomatoes) among those that Ted Danson has starred in and are available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\nWe will start by having WebSurfer gather the required information about Ted Danson's series.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.

Some pretty funny lines, two very attractive lead female characters which never hurts, and as well, a great message about bonds that are formed in life. Especially in the later stages, when things truly matter for the right reasons.\\n\\nI also found this show resonating with me, being that it touches upon dementia. Losing my father recently, and who battled this terrible disease, simply made me feel more connected. Yet, as each episode progressed, I became more invested, and found each character to be charming and endearing in their own unique way.\\n\\nI definitely recommend this series, and I also look forward to another season. It is feel good, not totally gut wrenching like some scenes in the classic film &quot;on Golden Pond&quot;, and all an all, just a relaxing and well written show.\",\n            \"reviewRating\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Rating\",\n                \"worstRating\": 1,\n                \"bestRating\": 10,\n                \"ratingValue\": 8\n            }\n        },\n        \"aggregateRating\": {\n            \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n            \"ratingCount\": 20469,\n            \"bestRating\": 10,\n            \"worstRating\": 1,\n            \"ratingValue\": 7.7\n        },\n        \"contentRating\": \"TV-14\",\n        \"genre\": [\n            \"Comedy\",\n            \"Crime\"\n        ],\n        \"datePublished\": \"2024-11-21\",\n        \"keywords\": \"based on documentary,criminal,investigation,undercover,resident\",\n        \"actor\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001101/\",\n                \"name\": \"Ted Danson\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1634944/\",\n                \"name\": \"Mary Elizabeth Ellis\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3499685/\",\n                \"name\": \"Lilah Richcreek Estrada\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"creator\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0070636/\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0447669/\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0505292/\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"trailer\": {\n            \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n            \"name\": \"Official Trailer\",\n            \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi748734745\",\n            \"thumbnail\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"contentUrl\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWYzMTM5MWItN2ZiMS00YWQyLWExY2YtYzA2YjY1OTRiNWY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg\"\n            },\n            \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWYzMTM5MWItN2ZiMS00YWQyLWExY2YtYzA2YjY1OTRiNWY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi748734745/\",\n            \"description\": \"Charles, a retired man, gets a new lease on life when he answers an ad from a private investigator and becomes a mole in a secret investigation in a nursing home.\",\n            \"duration\": \"PT2M26S\",\n            \"uploadDate\": \"2024-10-28T16:14:28.804Z\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width\",\n        \"description\": \"A Man on the Inside: With Ted Danson, Mary Elizabeth Ellis, Lilah Richcreek Estrada, Stephanie Beatriz.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "New plan:\n\nWe are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the worst rated series (according to Rotten Tomatoes) with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nSure, here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about Ted Danson.\n- Ted Danson has starred in multiple TV series, including but not limited to \"Cheers\", \"The Good Place\", \"CSI\", \"CSI: Cyber\", \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\", \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", \"Damages\", \"The Orville\", \"Mr. Mayor\", \"Fargo\", \"Bored to Death\", \"Help Me Help You\", and \"A Man on the Inside\".\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Rotten Tomatoes ratings for all series Ted Danson has starred in.\n- Which series with more than 1 season Ted Danson has starred in.\n- Availability of these series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- Rotten Tomatoes score of each series to determine the worst-rated.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Comparison of Rotten Tomatoes scores to determine the worst-rated series.\n- Matching the availability on Amazon Prime Video with the list of worst-rated series.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Ted Danson is widely known for popular shows such as \"Cheers\", \"The Good Place\", and \"CSI\". A less popular series could potentially have a lower rating.\n- \"CSI: Cyber\" is one of the less popular spin-offs of the CSI franchise and might have a lower rating compared to other series Ted Danson has been involved with.\n\nYour additional context about less popular shows like \"CSI: Cyber\" potentially having lower ratings can be helpful in narrowing down potential candidates for the worst-rated series.\n\nOur next step will be to find and compare the Rotten Tomatoes ratings for the series Ted Danson has starred in and then check their availability on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n## Root Cause of Failure\nThe failure resulted from several issues:\n- Repetitive searches and navigation to pages that did not provide the consolidated list of Ted Danson's TV series.\n- Inefficient retrieval of the relevant information from the sources like IMDb and TV Guide.\n- Lack of a systematic approach to gather ratings and availability details.\n\n## New Plan with Steps to Overcome Prior Challenges\n1. **Gather Comprehensive List of Ted Danson's TV Series:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Search for a consolidated list of TV series that Ted Danson has starred in from a reliable source (IMDb, TV Guide, or Wikipedia).\n     \n2. **Identify Series with More than One Season:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Confirm which of those TV series have more than one season. \n\n3. **Collect Rotten Tomatoes Ratings:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Look up individual Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each confirmed TV series.\n\n4. **Check Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US):**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Verify which of those series are available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n5. **Determine the Worst-Rated Series:**\n   - **Assistant:** Compare the ratings of the TV series available on Amazon Prime Video and confirm the worst-rated series based on Rotten Tomatoes scores.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n- **Step 1:** WebSurfer to search for \"Ted Danson complete TV series list IMDb\". Gather all relevant series in one attempt without switching between multiple pages.\n- **Step 2:** Identify which series from the list have more than one season.\n- **Step 3:** WebSurfer to search and note down Rotten Tomatoes scores for each series identified in Step 2.\n- **Step 4:** Verify the availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video in the US.\n- **Step 5:** Based on the data collected, Assistant to compare and identify the worst-rated series available on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures efficient retrieval of necessary information, saving time, and minimizing redundancy."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "New plan:\n\nWe are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the worst rated series (according to Rotten Tomatoes) with more than 1 season that Ted Danson has starred in and is available on Amazon Prime Video (US)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nSure, here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about Ted Danson.\n- Ted Danson has starred in multiple TV series, including but not limited to \"Cheers\", \"The Good Place\", \"CSI\", \"CSI: Cyber\", \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\", \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", \"Damages\", \"The Orville\", \"Mr. Mayor\", \"Fargo\", \"Bored to Death\", \"Help Me Help You\", \"Becker”, and \"A Man on the Inside\".\n- Ted Danson also starred in other series such as \"American Dad!\", \"Frasier\", \"The Simpsons\", and \"King of the Hill\".\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Rotten Tomatoes ratings for all series Ted Danson has starred in.\n- Which series with more than 1 season Ted Danson has starred in.\n- Availability of these series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n- Rotten Tomatoes score of each series to determine the worst-rated.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Comparison of Rotten Tomatoes scores to determine the worst-rated series.\n- Matching the availability on Amazon Prime Video with the list of worst-rated series.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES AND HUNCHES\n- Ted Danson is widely known for popular shows such as \"Cheers\", \"The Good Place\", and \"CSI\". A less popular series could potentially have a lower rating.\n- \"CSI: Cyber\" is one of the less popular spin-offs of the CSI franchise and might have a lower rating compared to other series Ted Danson has been involved with.\n- Based on preliminary information about ratings, series like \"Becker\" and \"Help Me Help You\" might be candidates for lower ratings as they are less frequently mentioned compared to Ted Danson’s more popular series.\n\nThis systematic approach will help in pinpointing the least-rated series involving Ted Danson on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\nOur next step is to collect Rotten Tomatoes ratings for these series and then verify their availability on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n## Root Cause of Failure\nThe failure resulted from several issues:\n- Inefficient navigation through the IMDb list to get all series information.\n- Lack of consolidated data collection in a single session, leading to repetitive tasks and incomplete data extraction.\n- Insufficient progress in verifying series with more than one season.\n\n## New Plan with Steps to Overcome Prior Challenges\n1. **Gather Comprehensive List of Ted Danson's TV Series:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Search for a consolidated and detailed list of TV series Ted Danson has starred in. Aggregate all names from IMDb and other reliable sources like TV Guide or Wikipedia in one go.\n   \n2. **Identify Series with More than One Season:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Confirm which of those TV series have more than one season. List these series separately.\n\n3. **Collect Rotten Tomatoes Ratings:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Search for and note down Rotten Tomatoes scores for each confirmed TV series with more than one season.\n\n4. **Check Availability on Amazon Prime Video (US):**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Verify which of the series are available on Amazon Prime Video (US). List them separately.\n\n5. **Determine the Worst-Rated Series:**\n   - **Assistant:** Compare the Rotten Tomatoes ratings of the TV series available on Amazon Prime Video and confirm which one is the worst-rated.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n- **Step 1:** WebSurfer to search for \"Ted Danson full TV series list IMDb Wikipedia TV Guide.\" Gather all Ted Danson's series in one session without switching between multiple pages.\n- **Step 2:** WebSurfer to filter out which series have more than one season.\n- **Step 3:** WebSurfer to search and compile Rotten Tomatoes ratings for these series.\n- **Step 4:** WebSurfer to verify Amazon Prime Video availability for each series.\n- **Step 5:** Assistant to compare: identify the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score among series available on Amazon Prime.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient completion of the task by avoiding redundant searches and focusing on progressive data collection and comparison."}
