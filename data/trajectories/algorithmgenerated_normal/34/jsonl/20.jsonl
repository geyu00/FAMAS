{"agent": "Verification_Expert", "content": "The total number of wheels for the steam locomotives listed in the file is 112.\n\nTo verify, let's break down the calculations step by step:\n\n1. '0-4-0': 0 (leading) + 4 (driving) + 0 (trailing) = 4 * 2 = 8 wheels\n2. '4-4-0': 4 (leading) + 4 (driving) + 0 (trailing) = 8 * 2 = 16 wheels\n3. '2-6-0': 2 (leading) + 6 (driving) + 0 (trailing) = 8 * 2 = 16 wheels\n4. '2-8-0': 2 (leading) + 8 (driving) + 0 (trailing) = 10 * 2 = 20 wheels\n5. '2-6-4': 2 (leading) + 6 (driving) + 4 (trailing) = 12 * 2 = 24 wheels\n6.
