{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Magic: The Gathering Standard card (non-foil paper version released in its original set) that was banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns (including Oko, Crown of Thorns) had the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The card must be a non-foil paper version released in its original set.\n   - The card was banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns (including Oko, Crown of Thorns).\n   - We need to find the card with the highest price decrease from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The exact date when Oko, Thief of Crowns (and Oko, Crown of Thorns) were banned.\n   - The list of cards banned at the same time as Oko, Thief of Crowns.\n   - The historical price data for each of these cards, including their all-time highs and all-time lows.\n   - The source for historical price data, such as TCGplayer, MTG Goldfish, or similar authoritative platforms.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Calculate the price decrease for each card from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n   - Identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Based on the popularity and impact of Oko, Thief of Crowns, it is likely that several powerful or popular cards were banned alongside it.\n   - Cards that were highly sought after before the ban and saw a significant drop in demand after the ban are likely candidates for having a large price decrease.\n   - Cards like Teferi, Time Raveler, Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, and Lurrus of the Dream-Den are potential candidates, given their power level and impact on the meta.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Determine the Ban Date**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for the official Wizards of the Coast (WotC) announcement or article that details the ban of Oko, Thief of Crowns and Oko, Crown of Thorns. Extract the exact date of the ban and the list of cards banned at the same time.\n\n- **Step 2: Gather Historical Price Data**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Use the ban date to search for historical price data for each of the banned cards on authoritative sources like TCGplayer, MTG Goldfish, or similar platforms. Collect the all-time high and all-time low prices for each card.\n\n- **Step 3: Calculate Price Decrease**\n  - **Assistant**: Write a Python script to calculate the price decrease for each card from its all-time high to its all-time low.\n  - **ComputerTerminal**: Run the Python script provided by the Assistant to perform the calculations.\n\n- **Step 4: Identify the Card with the Highest Price Decrease**\n  - **Assistant**: Analyze the results from the Python script to identify the card with the highest price decrease.\n  - **Assistant**: Verify that the identified card meets all the criteria specified in the request (non-foil paper version released in its original set).\n\n- **Step 5: Present the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant**: Summarize the findings and provide the name of the card with the highest price decrease, along with the relevant price data."}
