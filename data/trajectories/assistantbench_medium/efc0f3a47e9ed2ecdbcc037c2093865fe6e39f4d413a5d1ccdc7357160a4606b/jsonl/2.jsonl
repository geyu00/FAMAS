{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser.

It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The mutual fund in question is a Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund.\n   - The transaction fees for the mutual fund are $0.\n   - The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n   - The Fidelity Hong Kong website is a potential source for finding the list of relevant mutual funds and their performance data.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds that have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance data (percentage increase) of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n   - These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news sites, or through financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The percentage increase for each relevant mutual fund over the specified period.\n   - The identification of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Fidelity likely has several international emerging markets equity mutual funds, but not all may have $0 transaction fees.\n   - The performance of these funds can vary significantly based on market conditions, so the fund with the lowest percentage increase might be one that invested in regions or sectors that underperformed during the given period.\n   - The Fidelity Hong Kong website may have a dedicated section for mutual funds with $0 transaction fees, which could simplify the search process.\n   - The Fidelity Hong Kong website's \"Funds\" section and \"Fund pricing and performance\" subsection are likely to contain the necessary information for identifying the relevant funds and their performance data.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Fidelity Hong Kong Website**: Given that we are repeatedly directed to the Fidelity Hong Kong website, it is reasonable to assume that this site contains comprehensive information about the mutual funds, including those with $0 transaction fees. The \"Funds\" section and \"Fund pricing and performance\" subsection are logical places to look for this information.\n- **Dedicated Section for $0 Transaction Fees**: Many financial websites have dedicated sections for fee-free transactions, which can help narrow down the search and make the process more efficient.\n- **Performance Data**: The \"Fund pricing and performance\" section is likely to have historical performance data, which is essential for calculating the percentage increase over the specified period.\n\nNext Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the Fidelity Hong Kong Website**:\n   - Go to the \"Funds\" section.\n   - Look for a dedicated section for mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n   - If not directly available, use the search function to find international emerging markets equity mutual funds with $0 transaction fees.\n2. **Gather Performance Data**:\n   - For each identified fund, collect the performance data (percentage increase) from May 2019 to May 2024.\n3. **Analyze and Identify the Fund**:\n   - Calculate the percentage increase for each fund.\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\nPlease proceed with navigating to the \"Funds\" section of the Fidelity Hong Kong website and locating the relevant mutual funds.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Navigation**: The WebSurfer was repeatedly directed to the main Fidelity Hong Kong homepage instead of the specific \"Funds\" section where the list of mutual funds and their performance data is located.\n2. **Lack of Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided to the WebSurfer were not specific enough to guide it through the navigation process, leading to repeated visits to the same page.\n3. **Overlooking User Confirmation**: The WebSurfer did not confirm the client category (e.g., Personal Investors) required to access the detailed fund information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Fidelity Hong Kong Website**:\n   - Open the Fidelity Hong Kong website: `https://www.fidelity.com.hk/en/`.\n   - Confirm the client category as \"Personal Investors\" to access the full range of mutual funds.\n\n2. **Locate the \"Funds\" Section**:\n   - Navigate to the \"Funds\" section from the main menu.\n   - Click on \"Overview\" to see the list of available funds.\n\n3. **Search for International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds**:\n   - Use the search function or filter options to find international emerging markets equity mutual funds.\n   - Ensure the search is filtered to show only funds with $0 transaction fees.\n\n4. **Gather Performance Data**:\n   - For each identified fund, navigate to the \"Fund pricing and performance\" section.\n   - Collect the performance data (percentage increase) from May 2019 to May 2024.\n\n5. **Analyze Data**:\n   - Compile the collected data into a structured format (e.g., a table or list).\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase over the specified period.\n\n6. **Verify and Confirm**:\n   - Double-check the identified fund's performance data to ensure accuracy.\n   - Summarize the findings and provide the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n### Detailed Instructions for WebSurfer\n\n1. **Open the Fidelity Hong Kong Website**:\n   ```sh\n   Open https://www.fidelity.com.hk/en/\n   ```\n\n2. **Confirm Client Category**:\n   - Scroll down to the \"Confirm your client category\" section.\n   - Select \"Personal Investors\".\n\n3. **Navigate to the \"Funds\" Section**:\n   - Click on \"Funds\" in the main menu.\n   - Click on \"Overview\" to see the list of available funds.\n\n4. **Search for International Emerging Markets Equity Mutual Funds**:\n   - Use the search bar to enter \"international emerging markets equity mutual funds\".\n   - Apply the filter to show only funds with $0 transaction fees.\n\n5. **Gather Performance Data**:\n   - For each identified fund, click on the fund name to go to its detailed page.\n   - Navigate to the \"Fund pricing and performance\" section.\n   - Note the percentage increase from May 2019 to May 2024.\n\n6. **Compile and Analyze Data**:\n   - Return to the assistant with the list of funds and their performance data.\n   - Identify the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n7. **Summarize Findings**:\n   - Provide the name of the fund with the lowest percentage increase and its performance data.\n\nPlease proceed with the new plan and detailed instructions."}

We are currently observing an increasing number of fraudulent events involving the misuse of the Fidelity name and branding as part of investment scams. These are primarily occurring via the WhatsApp messaging platform and on social media channels and involve fraudsters contacting people out of the blue whilst posing as Fidelity representatives or employees. Individuals are then offered investment opportunities which are in no way affiliated to Fidelity. Any communication of this nature is fraudulent.\nIn some instances, Fidelity employees such as Anthony Bolton have directly been impersonated. Deepfake videos are used to make the content appear more realistic and appear that the investment recommendations provided are legitimate. This activity is fraudulent and not in any way affiliated to Fidelity or Anthony Bolton.\nFidelity or Fidelity fund managers will never make unsolicited contact offering investment opportunities or ask for individuals to share any personal information via WhatsApp, phone, email, SMS or social media. Be particularly vigilant over any unsolicited contact and do not share any personal information. Please report any instances to the Fidelity social media platform. More information of how to stay safe online can be found \nhere.\n2. Beware of scams and fraudsters impersonating Fidelity.

We are currently observing an increasing number of fraudulent events involving the misuse of the Fidelity name and branding as part of investment scams. These are primarily occurring via the WhatsApp messaging platform and on social media channels and involve fraudsters contacting people out of the blue whilst posing as Fidelity representatives or employees. Individuals are then offered investment opportunities which are in no way affiliated to Fidelity. Any communication of this nature is fraudulent.\nIn some instances, Fidelity employees such as Anthony Bolton have directly been impersonated. Deepfake videos are used to make the content appear more realistic and appear that the investment recommendations provided are legitimate. This activity is fraudulent and not in any way affiliated to Fidelity or Anthony Bolton.\nFidelity or Fidelity fund managers will never make unsolicited contact offering investment opportunities or ask for individuals to share any personal information via WhatsApp, phone, email, SMS or social media. Be particularly vigilant over any unsolicited contact and do not share any personal information. Please report any instances to the Fidelity social media platform. More information of how to stay safe online can be found \nhere.\n2. Beware of scams and fraudsters impersonating Fidelity. We\n will not make unsolicited contact with members of the public via phone call, email, mail or instant messaging platforms (e.g. Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat, Facebook/Instagram personal accounts etc.), nor will we ask for your bank, credit card, investment, insurance, MPF account or other key personal information via embedded hyperlinks, unless arising from requests by you or your employers. Any such contact is fraudulent and will very likely be an investment scam or a message purported to be coming from our institution.\nLearn more about common threats and how to protect yourself \nhere.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n#### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The mutual fund in question is a Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund.\n- The transaction fees for the mutual fund are $0.\n- The time period of interest is from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- We are looking for the fund with the lowest percentage increase over this period.\n- The Fidelity Hong Kong website is a potential source for finding the list of relevant mutual funds and their performance data.\n- The Fidelity Hong Kong website requires confirmation of the client category as \"Personal Investors\" to access detailed fund information.\n- The Fidelity Hong Kong website has a mandatory step to accept important risk disclosures before accessing detailed fund information.\n- The Fidelity Hong Kong website contains an \"Important Notice\" section with warnings about fraud and security measures.\n\n#### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual funds that have $0 transaction fees.\n- The performance data (percentage increase) of these funds from May 2019 to May 2024.\n- These details can be found on Fidelity's official website, financial news sites, or through financial databases like Morningstar.\n\n#### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The percentage increase for each relevant mutual fund over the specified period.\n- The identification of the fund with the lowest percentage increase.\n\n#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Dedicated Section for $0 Transaction Fees**: The Fidelity Hong Kong website likely has a dedicated section or filter for mutual funds with $0 transaction fees, which can help narrow down the search.\n- **Performance Data Location**: The \"Fund pricing and performance\" section within the \"Funds\" section is likely to contain the necessary historical performance data.\n- **Market Conditions Impact**: The performance of these funds can vary significantly based on market conditions, so the fund with the lowest percentage increase might be one that invested in regions or sectors that underperformed during the given period.\n- **User Interface**: The website may have a user interface that requires multiple steps to navigate, including confirming the client category and accepting risk disclosures.\n- **Additional Filters**: There may be additional filters or categories within the \"Funds\" section that can help refine the search, such as \"Emerging Markets\" or \"Equity Funds.\"\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Dedicated Section for $0 Transaction Fees**: Financial websites often have filters or dedicated sections for fee-free transactions to help users quickly find relevant funds.\n- **Performance Data Location**: The \"Fund pricing and performance\" section is a standard location for historical performance data on financial websites.\n- **Market Conditions Impact**: Economic and geopolitical factors can significantly impact the performance of emerging markets, leading to varying returns among different funds.\n- **User Interface**: Financial websites often have multiple steps to ensure users are aware of the risks and are properly categorized.\n- **Additional Filters**: Adding this guess helps streamline the search process by leveraging specific categories that might be available on the website.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Navigate to the Fidelity Hong Kong Website**:\n   -

We are currently observing an increasing number of fraudulent events involving the misuse of the Fidelity name and branding as part of investment scams. These are primarily occurring via the WhatsApp messaging platform and on social media channels and involve fraudsters contacting people out of the blue whilst posing as Fidelity representatives or employees. Individuals are then offered investment opportunities which are in no way affiliated to Fidelity. Any communication of this nature is fraudulent.\nIn some instances, Fidelity employees such as Anthony Bolton have directly been impersonated. Deepfake videos are used to make the content appear more realistic and appear that the investment recommendations provided are legitimate. This activity is fraudulent and not in any way affiliated to Fidelity or Anthony Bolton.\nFidelity or Fidelity fund managers will never make unsolicited contact offering investment opportunities or ask for individuals to share any personal information via WhatsApp, phone, email, SMS or social media. Be particularly vigilant over any unsolicited contact and do not share any personal information. Please report any instances to the Fidelity social media platform. More information of how to stay safe online can be found \nhere.\n2. Beware of scams and fraudsters impersonating Fidelity. We\n will not make unsolicited contact with members of the public via phone call, email, mail or instant messaging platforms (e.g. Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat, Facebook/Instagram personal accounts etc.), nor will we ask for your bank, credit card, investment, insurance, MPF account or other key personal information via embedded hyperlinks, unless arising from requests by you or your employers. Any such contact is fraudulent and will very likely be an investment scam or a message purported to be coming from our institution.\nLearn more about common threats and how to protect yourself \nhere.
