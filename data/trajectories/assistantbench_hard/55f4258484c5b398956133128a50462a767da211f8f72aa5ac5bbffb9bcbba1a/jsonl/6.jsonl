Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The series must have more than 1 season.\n   - Ted Danson must have starred in the series.\n   - The series must be available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - The series must be rated on Rotten Tomatoes.\n   - The goal is to find the worst-rated series according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - List of all series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Number of seasons for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n   - Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series starring Ted Danson.\n   - Specific Rotten Tomatoes ratings for series with more than 1 season and available on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Identify which series starring Ted Danson meet all the criteria (more than 1 season, available on Amazon Prime Video, and rated on Rotten Tomatoes).\n   - Determine the worst-rated series among those that meet the criteria.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Ted Danson has starred in several well-known series, such as \"Cheers,\" \"The Good Place,\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" but these are generally highly rated.\n   - Lesser-known or more recent series might be less critically acclaimed and could potentially have lower Rotten Tomatoes scores.\n   - Series like \"Bored to Death\" or \"Damages\" might be worth checking, as they are less mainstream and could have lower ratings.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: WebSurfer Search**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for a comprehensive list of Ted Danson's TV series.\n  - Verify the number of seasons for each series.\n  - Check the availability of each series on Amazon Prime Video (US).\n\n- **Step 2: Rotten Tomatoes Ratings**\n  - Use WebSurfer to find the Rotten Tomatoes ratings for each series that meets the criteria (more than 1 season and available on Amazon Prime Video).\n\n- **Step 3: Filter and Compare**\n  - Filter the list to include only series with more than 1 season and available on Amazon Prime Video.\n  - Compare the Rotten Tomatoes ratings to identify the worst-rated series.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify and Confirm**\n  - Double-check the information to ensure accuracy.\n  - Provide the name of the worst-rated series that meets all the criteria."}
