The second chorus in \"Thriller\" appears after the first chorus, and it typically follows a repetition of key themes and lines from the first chorus.\n\nTo accurately determine the last word before the second chorus, I'll need to provide a full structured representation of the lyrics leading up to that point to identify the placement of the choruses.\n\nBased on the standard structure of \"Thriller,\" the second chorus would come after the verses that follow the first chorus.
