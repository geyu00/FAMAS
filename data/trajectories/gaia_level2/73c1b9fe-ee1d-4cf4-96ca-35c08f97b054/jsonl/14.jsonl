American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998).Disclaimer:\nThe Nonindigenous Occurrences section of the NAS species profiles has a new structure. The section is now dynamically updated from the NAS database to ensure that it contains the most current and accurate information. Occurrences are summarized in Table 1, alphabetically by state, with years of earliest and most recent observations, and the tally and names of drainages where the species was observed. The table contains hyperlinks to collections tables of specimens based on the states, years, and drainages selected.

The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

The alligators spotted in Essex County, New Jersey, may have escaped a lagoon in Military Park, Newark (Anonymous in Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n Perhaps they had been part of a public animal display.\n The \nA. mississippiensis collected from Mesa County, Colorado, escaped from a roadside zoo (Livo et al., 1998), while the one collected from the Colorado River in California had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978).\n Conant (1977) suggested that an animal dealer intentionally established the \nA. mississippiensis population found in the Brownsville area of Cameron County, Texas.\nStatus: All the American alligators found in New York have been collected (Anderson and Habuda, 2001; Anonymous, 2001a, b; Beebe, 2001c; Heaton-Jones, 2001; Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). They are not established in this state nor could they survive the cold winters, and the story of alligators dwelling in New York City sewers is simply a well-entrenched myth (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). One of the alligators found in Union County, New Jersey, was collected; although there is no further word about the success of the 1933 great gator hunt started on the Passaic River in Essex County (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n All \nA. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).\n Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous \nA. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are \"thriving.\" There is no evidence of reproduction.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as \"not well established\" in Arizona.\nImpact of Introduction: There is no evidence that any of the nonindigenous occurrences of American alligators have had any impact on indigenous ecosystems; however, an established population of these massive carnivores in a southwestern state could negatively impact indigenous fauna. The introductions in Oklahoma, and the presumptive introduction in Cameron County, Texas, could compromise the genetic integrity of extant indigenous populations. As mentioned above, the status of indigenous alligators in Oklahoma could be obfuscated, thus creating difficulties when deciding conservation measures and future protective legislation. A large alligator is a potentially dangerous carnivore.\n While attacks on humans are exceedingly rare, they do occur on occasion (Pooley et al., 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Anonymous, 2002).\nRemarks: The taxonomy of A. mississippiensis has been reviewed or summarized by Smith and Smith (1977), King (1989), Ross and Ernst (1994), and Crother et al. (2000). Liner (1994) provides a Spanish vernacular name for the American alligator.  Brisbin et al. (1986), Gibbons and Semlitsch (1991), and Ross and Ernst (1994) provide the best literature reviews of the natural history of alligators. A variety of authors have contributed to or summarized the natural history and biology of American alligators (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973, 1976; Mount, 1975; Lang, 1987, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Vliet, 1989; and a variety of contributions compiled by Webb et al., 1987). Scientific and standard English names follow Crother (2008).Alligator mississippiensis is an aquatic, omnicarnivorous reptile capable of living in many types of waterways, both natural and man-made, and feeding upon almost any fauna it can catch (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Mount, 1975; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Some alligators dig deep holes with connecting dens than can remain filled with water during droughts, thus maintaining an aquatic environment for indigenous fauna (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Grenard, 1991).\n Courtship and mating involves complex visual and auditory displays directed at prospective mates and competitors (McIlhenny, 1935; Lang, 1987, 1989; Vliet, 1989).\n The female buries her hard-shelled eggs in a nest she constructs of dead vegetation and the surrounding muck (McIlhenny, 1935; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Females exhibit varying degrees of parental care by guarding the nest, releasing hatchlings from the nest and eggs, and transporting them to water in her mouth (Kushlan and Simon, 1981; Lang, 1987; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n Young may remain in a protective crèche with the mother and sometimes other adults for a considerable length of time, sometimes exceeding a year (Lang, 1987, 1989; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n American alligators are subject to a variety of state and federal regulations (Levell, 1997); they should not be obtained by anyone before such legislation is understood along the responsibility that goes with keeping them as captives.\nReferences \n(click for full references) Ashton, R.

The earliest records of alligators in Texas date back to the 19th century, with reports indicating their presence in the lower Rio Grande Valley, including Brownsville, as early as the 1850s. This suggests that alligators were likely indigenous to this area rather than introduced. 2\nPopulation Recovery: After facing significant declines due to habitat loss and hunting, the American alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967. Conservation efforts, including legal protections and habitat restoration, allowed their populations to rebound significantly. By the 1980s, alligators were once again thriving in many parts of their historical range, including Texas. 1\nCurrent Status: Today, the American alligator is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem, playing a crucial role in maintaining the health of wetland habitats. Their presence in areas west of Texas, particularly in the Rio Grande Valley, is now well-established, and they are monitored as part of ongoing conservation efforts.

American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \"Crocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\" and \"Caiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\" on this website for comparison. The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998).Disclaimer:\nThe Nonindigenous Occurrences section of the NAS species profiles has a new structure.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking for the year when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source for this information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The American Alligator is native to the southeastern United States, with its range historically extending to the Gulf Coast and into parts of Texas.\n   - The earliest records of alligators in Texas date back to the 19th century, with reports indicating their presence in the lower Rio Grande Valley, including Brownsville, as early as the 1850s.\n   - The American alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967 and has since recovered significantly due to conservation efforts.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - This information can be found on the USGS website or in their published reports and databases related to wildlife distribution and historical records.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given request.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the historical presence of alligators in the lower Rio Grande Valley, including Brownsville, it is possible that the first recorded instance of the American Alligator west of Texas (not including Texas) occurred in the 19th century.\n   - However, the exact year when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas) is still unknown and needs to be verified from the USGS data.\n   - The recovery and expansion of the alligator population in the late 20th century might have led to more frequent sightings and records, but the earliest documented instance could still be from the 19th century.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Historical Presence in the Rio Grande Valley**: The information from the search results indicates that alligators were present in the lower Rio Grande Valley, including Brownsville, as early as the 1850s. This suggests that the alligators might have naturally extended their range slightly west of Texas during this period.\n- **Conservation Efforts**: The significant recovery of the alligator population in the late 20th century might have led to more frequent and widespread sightings, but the earliest documented instance could predate this recovery period.\n\nBy focusing on the historical records and the specific mention of the lower Rio Grande Valley, we can narrow down our search to the 19th century for the earliest documented instance of the American Alligator west of Texas.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Inefficient Search Strategy**: The initial search terms did not yield the specific information needed. The search terms were too broad and did not focus on the exact year.\n- **Lack of Direct Navigation**: We did not directly navigate to the most relevant sections of the USGS website, such as the \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\" table, which might contain the specific year.\n- **Insufficient Scrolling and Searching**: We did not scroll far enough or search thoroughly enough within the USGS page to find the relevant information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Refine Search Terms**: Use more specific search terms to find the exact year when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas.\n- **Direct Navigation**: Navigate directly to the \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\" section on the USGS page, which contains detailed records of sightings.\n- **Thorough Scrolling and Searching**: Scroll through the entire page and use the search function within the browser to find the specific year.\n\n### New Plan in Bullet Points\n\n- **Refine Search Terms**:\n  - Perform a web search using the term \"USGS American Alligator first documented west of Texas year\".\n- **Direct Navigation**:\n  - Navigate to the USGS page for the American Alligator species profile: [American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221).\n  - Scroll down to the \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\" section.\n- **Thorough Scrolling and Searching**:\n  - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to search for keywords like \"west of Texas\", \"year\", and \"first documented\".\n  - Scroll through the entire \"Nonindigenous Occurrences\" table to find the earliest record of the American Alligator found west of Texas.\n- **Extract and Verify Information**:\n  - Once the relevant information is found, extract the specific year and verify it from the USGS source.\n- **Report Findings**:\n  - Provide the year and any additional context or details found during the search."}

The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).

American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994).

The alligators spotted in Essex County, New Jersey, may have escaped a lagoon in Military Park, Newark (Anonymous in Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n Perhaps they had been part of a public animal display.\n The \nA. mississippiensis collected from Mesa County, Colorado, escaped from a roadside zoo (Livo et al., 1998), while the one collected from the Colorado River in California had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978).\n Conant (1977) suggested that an animal dealer intentionally established the \nA. mississippiensis population found in the Brownsville area of Cameron County, Texas.\nStatus: All the American alligators found in New York have been collected (Anderson and Habuda, 2001; Anonymous, 2001a, b; Beebe, 2001c; Heaton-Jones, 2001; Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). They are not established in this state nor could they survive the cold winters, and the story of alligators dwelling in New York City sewers is simply a well-entrenched myth (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001). One of the alligators found in Union County, New Jersey, was collected; although there is no further word about the success of the 1933 great gator hunt started on the Passaic River in Essex County (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).\n All \nA. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).\n Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous \nA. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are \"thriving.\" There is no evidence of reproduction.\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}

{"agent": "WebSurfer", "content": "I scrolled down one page in the browser.\n\nThe web browser is open to the page [American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221).\nThe viewport shows 16% of the webpage, and is positioned 61% down from the top of the page\nThe following text is visible in the viewport:\n\nAll \nA. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).\n Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous \nA. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are \"thriving.\" There is no evidence of reproduction.\n There is a possibility that introduced American alligators in Oklahoma may establish populations in or near the southeastern corner of the state; thus interacting with indigenous populations in this region ([Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]).\n The \nA. mississippiensis populations in the Brownsville area, Cameron County, and the surrounding lower Rio Grande Valley are established but some authors suggest they could be nonindigenous (Conant, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998).\n Since alligators were reported from the Brownsville region before the presumptive introductions took place (Baird, 1859), they are probably indigenous (Ross and Ernst, 1994).\n Indigenous populations may have simply been augmented by intentional introductions (Conant, 1977).\n The \nA. mississippiensis in Boulder, Colorado, was collected (Livo et al., 1998).\n Only one of the American alligators was collected from the Colorado River, Mesa County, Colorado; the other was never recaptured, but there is no evidence of an established population (Livo et al., 1998).\n The American alligators from Phoenix, Arizona, were collected (M. Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as \"not well established\" in Arizona.\nImpact of Introduction: There is no evidence that any of the nonindigenous occurrences of American alligators have had any impact on indigenous ecosystems; however, an established population of these massive carnivores in a southwestern state could negatively impact indigenous fauna. The introductions in Oklahoma, and the presumptive introduction in Cameron County, Texas, could compromise the genetic integrity of extant indigenous populations. As mentioned above, the status of indigenous alligators in Oklahoma could be obfuscated, thus creating difficulties when deciding conservation measures and future protective legislation. A large alligator is a potentially dangerous carnivore.\n While attacks on humans are exceedingly rare, they do occur on occasion (Pooley et al., 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Anonymous, 2002).\nRemarks: The taxonomy of A. mississippiensis has been reviewed or summarized by Smith and Smith (1977), King (1989), Ross and Ernst (1994), and Crother et al. (2000). Liner (1994) provides a Spanish vernacular name for the American alligator.  Brisbin et al. (1986), Gibbons and Semlitsch (1991), and Ross and Ernst (1994) provide the best literature reviews of the natural history of alligators. A variety of authors have contributed to or summarized the natural history and biology of American alligators (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973, 1976; Mount, 1975; Lang, 1987, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Vliet, 1989; and a variety of contributions compiled by Webb et al., 1987). Scientific and standard English names follow Crother (2008).Alligator mississippiensis is an aquatic, omnicarnivorous reptile capable of living in many types of waterways, both natural and man-made, and feeding upon almost any fauna it can catch (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Mount, 1975; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Some alligators dig deep holes with connecting dens than can remain filled with water during droughts, thus maintaining an aquatic environment for indigenous fauna (McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Carr, 1973; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Grenard, 1991).\n Courtship and mating involves complex visual and auditory displays directed at prospective mates and competitors (McIlhenny, 1935; Lang, 1987, 1989; Vliet, 1989).\n The female buries her hard-shelled eggs in a nest she constructs of dead vegetation and the surrounding muck (McIlhenny, 1935; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991).\n Females exhibit varying degrees of parental care by guarding the nest, releasing hatchlings from the nest and eggs, and transporting them to water in her mouth (Kushlan and Simon, 1981; Lang, 1987; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n Young may remain in a protective crèche with the mother and sometimes other adults for a considerable length of time, sometimes exceeding a year (Lang, 1987, 1989; Shine, 1988; Magnusson et al., 1989).\n American alligators are subject to a variety of state and federal regulations (Levell, 1997); they should not be obtained by anyone before such legislation is understood along the responsibility that goes with keeping them as captives.\nReferences \n(click for full references) Ashton, R.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to the USGS, in what year was the American Alligator first found west of Texas (not including Texas)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on the information we have gathered so far:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is asking for the year when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - The source for this information is the USGS (United States Geological Survey).\n   - The American Alligator is native to the southeastern United States, with its range historically extending to the Gulf Coast and into parts of Texas.\n   - The earliest records of alligators in Texas date back to the 19th century, with reports indicating their presence in the lower Rio Grande Valley, including Brownsville, as early as the 1850s.\n   - The American alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967 and has since recovered significantly due to conservation efforts.\n   - The USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database contains detailed records of nonindigenous occurrences of the American Alligator, including locations and dates.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific year when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n   - This information can be found on the USGS NAS database, specifically in the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific derivations are required based on the given request.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Given the historical presence of alligators in the lower Rio Grande Valley, including Brownsville, it is possible that the first recorded instance of the American Alligator west of Texas (not including Texas) occurred in the 19th century.\n   - However, the exact year when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas) is still unknown and needs to be verified from the USGS data.\n   - The recovery and expansion of the alligator population in the late 20th century might have led to more frequent sightings and records, but the earliest documented instance could predate this recovery period.\n   - Based on the USGS NAS database, the earliest nonindigenous occurrence of the American Alligator outside its native range could provide clues. However, the specific entry for occurrences west of Texas needs to be identified.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Historical Presence in the Rio Grande Valley**: The information from the search results indicates that alligators were present in the lower Rio Grande Valley, including Brownsville, as early as the 1850s. This suggests that the alligators might have naturally extended their range slightly west of Texas during this period.\n- **Conservation Efforts**: The significant recovery of the alligator population in the late 20th century might have led to more frequent and widespread sightings, but the earliest documented instance could predate this recovery period.\n- **USGS NAS Database**: The USGS NAS database is a comprehensive resource for nonindigenous occurrences. By focusing on the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section, we can find the specific year and location of the first recorded instance of the American Alligator found west of Texas.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Navigate to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section** on the USGS NAS database page for the American Alligator.\n- **Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F)** to search for 'west of Texas' or 'beyond Texas'.\n- **If this does not yield results**, try searching for 'nonindigenous occurrences' and look for the earliest record of the American Alligator found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n- **Extract and report the specific year and any additional context**.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps to find the exact year.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Navigation**: The web surfer navigated to the references page instead of staying on the main species profile page where the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section is located.\n- **Search Function Misuse**: The search function was used on the references page instead of the main species profile page, leading to irrelevant results.\n- **Lack of Specificity**: The search terms used were too broad and did not directly target the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section.\n\n### New Plan\n\n- **Navigate Correctly**:\n  - Ensure the web surfer is on the correct page: [American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221).\n  - Scroll down to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section.\n\n- **Use Search Function Effectively**:\n  - Use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to search for 'west of Texas' or 'beyond Texas' within the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section.\n  - If the specific phrase is not found, search for 'nonindigenous occurrences' and manually scan the table for the earliest record of the American Alligator found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n\n- **Extract and Verify Information**:\n  - Once the relevant information is found, extract the specific year and any additional context.\n  - Verify the information by cross-referencing with the table entries and any linked references.\n\n- **Report Findings**:\n  - Provide the year and any additional context or details found during the search.\n\n### New Plan in Bullet Points\n\n- **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n  - Open the page: [American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) - Species Profile](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=221).\n  - Scroll down to the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section.\n\n- **Use Search Function**:\n  - Use Ctrl + F to search for 'west of Texas' or 'beyond Texas' within the 'Nonindigenous Occurrences' section.\n  - If not found, search for 'nonindigenous occurrences' and manually scan the table for the earliest record of the American Alligator found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n\n- **Extract and Verify Information**:\n  - Extract the specific year and any additional context.\n  - Verify the information by cross-referencing with the table entries and any linked references.\n\n- **Report Findings**:\n  - Provide the year and any additional context or details found during the search."}

The general dorsal coloration is black, but light juvenile markings may be present in adults; young have bold, yellowish crossbands on a black background (Grenard, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1998). The voice of both males and females is a throaty, deep, bellowing roar (McIlhenny, 1935; Elliott, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998). Elliott (1994) has made a recording of this penetrating roar available on a CD. Females may grunt like pigs when calling to their young (McIlhenny, 1935; Conant and Collins, 1998). American alligators have been illustrated by numerous authors over the years; the list provided here is not exhaustive (Reese, 1912; McIlhenny, 1935; Neill, 1971; Guggisberg, 1972; Carr, 1973; Mount, 1975; Perrero, 1975; Smith and Smith, 1977; Behler and King, 1979; Toops, 1979; Martof et al., 1980; Smith and Brodie, 1982; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Webb et al., 1987; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; Hirschhorn, 1989; Lazell, 1989; Ross, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Glasgow, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Mahony, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Lamar, 1997; Conant and Collins, 1998; Magnusson, 1998; Powell et al., 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Zug et al., 2001).\nSize: total length of 1.8 - 5 mNative Range: The indigenous range of A. mississippiensis is from coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and the Keys, and westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma (Martof, 1956; Duellman and Schwartz, 1958; Webb, 1970; Mount, 1975; Stevenson, 1976; Martof et al., 1980; Lohoefener and Altig, 1983; Garrett and Barker, 1987; Groombridge, 1987; Moler, 1988; [Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]; Carpenter and Krupa, 1989; Dundee and Rossman, 1989; King, 1989, 2000; Lazell, 1989; Ross and Magnusson, 1989; Ashton and Ashton, 1991; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Gibbons and Semlitsch, 1991; Grenard, 1991; Ross and Ernst, 1994; Palmer and Braswell, 1995; Conant and Collins, 1998; Bartlett and Bartlett, 1999a, b; Behler, 1999; Dixon, 2000; Meshaka et al., 2000). American alligators may eventually be found in Mexico in localities adjacent to the Texas border (Smith and Smith, 1976, 1977, 1993; Ross and Ernst, 1994). Over much of its range A. mississippiensis has been eliminated, making an accurate determination of its modern distribution difficult (Ross and Ernst, 1994; Conant and Collins, 1998).\nHere is a screenshot of the page.\n<image>"}
