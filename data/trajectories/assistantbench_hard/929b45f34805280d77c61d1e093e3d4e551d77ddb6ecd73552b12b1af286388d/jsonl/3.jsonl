What is the link to the files that were most relevant in May 2020?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The dog genome was first mapped in 2004.\n   - The request is specifically interested in the most relevant files as of May 2020.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of the dog genome assembly that was most relevant in May 2020.\n   - The location or database where the most relevant files for the dog genome can be accessed as of May 2020.\n   - The specific file names or identifiers for the most relevant dog genome data as of May 2020.\n   - Authoritative sources such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Ensembl, or the Broad Institute, which are likely to host the most up-to-date and relevant genomic data.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - No specific facts need to be derived through logical deduction, simulation, or computation based on the given request.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most relevant files in May 2020 are likely to be part of a major update or release of the dog genome assembly, possibly a version like CanFam3.1 or a more recent iteration.\n   - The files are likely to be available in standard genomic formats such as FASTA, GFF, or VCF.\n   - The NCBI's Genome Database or the Ensembl Genome Browser are strong candidates for hosting these files.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify the Most Relevant Dog Genome Assembly (WebSurfer)**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for the most relevant version of the dog genome assembly as of May 2020.\n  - Focus on authoritative sources such as NCBI, Ensembl, or the Broad Institute.\n  - Note the specific version number and release date.\n\n- **Step 2: Locate the Files (WebSurfer)**\n  - Once the specific version is identified, use WebSurfer to navigate to the corresponding database or repository.\n  - Locate the download links or FTP paths for the relevant files.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify the File Links (WebSurfer)**\n  - Ensure that the links are active and lead to the correct files.\n  - Note any additional metadata or documentation that might be useful.\n\n- **Step 4: Provide the Link (Assistant)**\n  - Compile the information gathered and provide the direct link to the most relevant files as of May 2020.\n  - Include any additional context or instructions for accessing the files if necessary."}
