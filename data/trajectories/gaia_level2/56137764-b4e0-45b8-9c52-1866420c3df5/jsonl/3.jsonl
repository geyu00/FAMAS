{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a contributor to a specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is the one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n   - The contributors to that specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - These facts can be found in the OpenCV changelog or release notes, and in historical records or official government websites for the names of Chinese leaders.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Matching the names of the contributors to the specific version of OpenCV with the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor could be Deng Xiaoping, as his name is commonly transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Another possibility could be Jiang Zemin, another prominent former leader of China.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the Version of OpenCV with Mask-RCNN Support**\n  - Use WebSurfer to search for the specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added.\n  - Verify the version number from the OpenCV changelog or release notes.\n\n- **List Contributors to the Identified Version of OpenCV**\n  - Use WebSurfer to find the contributors to the identified version of OpenCV.\n  - If necessary, use FileSurfer to download and parse the contributors' list from the OpenCV GitHub repository.\n\n- **List Former Chinese Heads of Government**\n  - Use WebSurfer to compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n\n- **Match Contributor Names with Former Chinese Leaders**\n  - Compare the names of the contributors to the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n  - Identify any matches.\n\n- **Verify the Match**\n  - Double-check the identified match using multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Report the Findings**\n  - Summarize the findings and provide the name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional information and refined educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a contributor to a specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is the one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Support for Mask-RCNN was added in OpenCV version 4.0, which was officially released in December 2018.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The contributors to OpenCV 4.0.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - These facts can be found in the OpenCV changelog or release notes, and in historical records or official government websites for the names of Chinese leaders.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Matching the names of the contributors to OpenCV 4.0 with the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor could be Deng Xiaoping, as his name is commonly transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Another possibility could be Jiang Zemin, another prominent former leader of China.\n   - Given the context and the common transliterations, the name \"Deng\" or \"Jiang\" could be a strong indicator. For example, a contributor named \"Deng\" or \"Jiang\" in the OpenCV 4.0 contributors list would be a significant match.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The OpenCV 4.0 release notes and changelogs are extensive, and navigating through them to find the list of contributors can be challenging. However, focusing on the names \"Deng\" or \"Jiang\" in the contributors list would be a strategic approach.\n- Historical records indicate that Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin are two of the most prominent former Chinese heads of government, and their names are frequently used in international contexts, making them likely candidates for matching.\n\nLet's proceed by focusing on finding the contributors to OpenCV 4.0 and checking for names that match \"Deng\" or \"Jiang.\"\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Excessive Context Length**: The web surfing attempts failed due to exceeding the maximum context length allowed by the model (32768 tokens). This indicates that the interactions were too lengthy, possibly due to repeated or redundant instructions.\n- **Inefficient Navigation**: The attempts to navigate through the OpenCV changelogs and contributors list were not focused enough, leading to unnecessary scrolling and searching.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to the Contributors Section**:\n   - Use the search functionality on the OpenCV 4.0 release page to directly find the contributors list.\n   - If the contributors list is not directly available, navigate to the detailed changelog and look for a section that mentions contributors.\n\n2. **Focus on Specific Names**:\n   - Once the contributors list is found, focus on names that match \"Deng\" or \"Jiang\" to identify the potential match.\n   - If the list is long, use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to quickly find these names.\n\n3. **Avoid Redundant Interactions**:\n   - Minimize the number of scrolls and clicks by being precise with each action.\n   - Use the search function to quickly navigate to the relevant sections of the page.\n\n4. **Summarize and Verify**:\n   - Once the potential match is found, summarize the findings and verify the name against the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the OpenCV 4.0 release page.\n  - URL: [OpenCV 4.0.0 · opencv/opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0)\n\n- **Step 2**: Use the search function on the page to find the contributors list.\n  - Type \"contributors\" or \"list of contributors\" in the search bar (Ctrl + F).\n\n- **Step 3**: If the contributors list is not directly available, navigate to the detailed changelog.\n  - Click on the \"Changelog\" link if available, or scroll to the section that mentions contributors.\n\n- **Step 4**: Focus on names that match \"Deng\" or \"Jiang\".\n  - Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to quickly find these names in the list.\n\n- **Step 5**: Summarize the findings and verify the name against the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n  - Ensure the name matches the Latin alphabet transliteration of a former Chinese head of government.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Use Precise Search Terms**: When searching the page, use precise terms like \"contributors\" or \"list of contributors\" to quickly find the relevant section.\n- **Minimize Scrolling**: Avoid unnecessary scrolling by using the search function to jump to specific sections.\n- **Verify Names**: Double-check the names found against a reliable list of former Chinese heads of government to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet's proceed with this plan to efficiently find the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the latest information and refined educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a contributor to a specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is the one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Support for Mask-RCNN was added in OpenCV version 4.0, which was officially released in December 2018.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The contributors to OpenCV 4.0.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - These facts can be found in the OpenCV changelog or release notes, and in historical records or official government websites for the names of Chinese leaders.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Matching the names of the contributors to OpenCV 4.0 with the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor could be Deng Xiaoping, as his name is commonly transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Another possibility could be Jiang Zemin, another prominent former leader of China.\n   - Given the context and the common transliterations, the name \"Deng\" or \"Jiang\" could be a strong indicator. For example, a contributor named \"Deng\" or \"Jiang\" in the OpenCV 4.0 contributors list would be a significant match.\n   - **New Guess**: Another prominent former Chinese leader is Li Peng, whose name is also commonly transliterated to the Latin alphabet. This adds another potential name to check in the contributors list.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The OpenCV 4.0 release notes and changelogs are extensive, and navigating through them to find the list of contributors can be challenging. However, focusing on the names \"Deng,\" \"Jiang,\" and \"Li\" in the contributors list would be a strategic approach.\n- Historical records indicate that Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Li Peng are prominent former Chinese heads of government, and their names are frequently used in international contexts, making them likely candidates for matching.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to the Contributors Section**:\n   - Use the search functionality on the OpenCV 4.0 release page to directly find the contributors list.\n   - If the contributors list is not directly available, navigate to the detailed changelog and look for a section that mentions contributors.\n\n2. **Focus on Specific Names**:\n   - Once the contributors list is found, focus on names that match \"Deng,\" \"Jiang,\" or \"Li\" to identify the potential match.\n   - If the list is long, use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to quickly find these names.\n\n3. **Avoid Redundant Interactions**:\n   - Minimize the number of scrolls and clicks by being precise with each action.\n   - Use the search function to quickly navigate to the relevant sections of the page.\n\n4. **Summarize and Verify**:\n   - Once the potential match is found, summarize the findings and verify the name against the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the OpenCV 4.0 release page.\n  - URL: [OpenCV 4.0.0 · opencv/opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0)\n\n- **Step 2**: Use the search function on the page to find the contributors list.\n  - Type \"contributors\" or \"list of contributors\" in the search bar (Ctrl + F).\n\n- **Step 3**: If the contributors list is not directly available, navigate to the detailed changelog.\n  - Click on the \"Changelog\" link if available, or scroll to the section that mentions contributors.\n\n- **Step 4**: Focus on names that match \"Deng,\" \"Jiang,\" or \"Li\".\n  - Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to quickly find these names in the list.\n\n- **Step 5**: Summarize the findings and verify the name against the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n  - Ensure the name matches the Latin alphabet transliteration of a former Chinese head of government.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Use Precise Search Terms**: When searching the page, use precise terms like \"contributors\" or \"list of contributors\" to quickly find the relevant section.\n- **Minimize Scrolling**: Avoid unnecessary scrolling by using the search function to jump to specific sections.\n- **Verify Names**: Double-check the names found against a reliable list of former Chinese heads of government to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet's proceed with this plan to efficiently find the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Search Scope**: The search for \"contributors\" was performed in the wrong context, leading to a search results page instead of the desired contributors list.\n- **Lack of Precision in Navigation**: The steps to navigate to the contributors list were not precise enough, causing the web surfer to end up on a different page.\n- **Redundant Actions**: Repeated actions and unnecessary navigation steps led to inefficiency and confusion.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - Open the OpenCV 4.0 release page: [OpenCV 4.0.0 · opencv/opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0).\n\n2. **Use the Search Function Precisely**:\n   - Use the search function (Ctrl + F) on the page to find the contributors list.\n   - Type \"contributors\" or \"list of contributors\" in the search bar.\n\n3. **Check for Changelog and Detailed Sections**:\n   - If the contributors list is not directly available, click on the \"Changelog\" link or navigate to the detailed changelog section.\n   - Look for a section that mentions contributors.\n\n4. **Focus on Specific Names**:\n   - Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to find names that match \"Deng,\" \"Jiang,\" or \"Li\" in the contributors list.\n\n5. **Summarize and Verify**:\n   - Once a potential match is found, summarize the findings.\n   - Verify the name against a reliable list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Use Precise Search Terms**: When searching the page, use precise terms like \"contributors\" or \"list of contributors\" to quickly find the relevant section.\n- **Minimize Scrolling**: Avoid unnecessary scrolling by using the search function to jump to specific sections.\n- **Verify Names**: Double-check the names found against a reliable list of former Chinese heads of government to ensure accuracy.\n- **Stay on the Correct Page**: Ensure that the search is performed on the OpenCV 4.0 release page and not on a search results page.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Open the OpenCV 4.0 release page.\n  - URL: [OpenCV 4.0.0 · opencv/opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0)\n\n- **Step 2**: Use the search function (Ctrl + F) on the page to find the contributors list.\n  - Type \"contributors\" or \"list of contributors\" in the search bar.\n\n- **Step 3**: If the contributors list is not directly available, click on the \"Changelog\" link or navigate to the detailed changelog section.\n  - Look for a section that mentions contributors.\n\n- **Step 4**: Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to find names that match \"Deng,\" \"Jiang,\" or \"Li\" in the contributors list.\n\n- **Step 5**: Summarize the findings and verify the name against the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n### Execute the Plan\n\nWebSurfer, please navigate to the OpenCV 4.0 release page at [OpenCV 4.0.0 · opencv/opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0). Use the search function (Ctrl + F) on the page to find the contributors list. Focus on names that match \"Deng,\" \"Jiang,\" or \"Li\". If the contributors list is not directly available, navigate to the detailed changelog and look for a section that mentions contributors."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the latest information and refined educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a contributor to a specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is the one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Support for Mask-RCNN was added in OpenCV version 4.0, which was officially released in December 2018.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The contributors to OpenCV 4.0.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - These facts can be found in the OpenCV changelog or release notes, and in historical records or official government websites for the names of Chinese leaders.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Matching the names of the contributors to OpenCV 4.0 with the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor could be Deng Xiaoping, as his name is commonly transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Another possibility could be Jiang Zemin, another prominent former leader of China.\n   - Given the context and the common transliterations, the name \"Deng\" or \"Jiang\" could be a strong indicator. For example, a contributor named \"Deng\" or \"Jiang\" in the OpenCV 4.0 contributors list would be a significant match.\n   - **New Guess**: Another prominent former Chinese leader is Li Peng, whose name is also commonly transliterated to the Latin alphabet. This adds another potential name to check in the contributors list.\n   - **Additional Guess**: The name \"Li\" is very common in China and could appear in the contributors list. Therefore, checking for \"Li\" in addition to \"Deng\" and \"Jiang\" is a reasonable step.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The OpenCV 4.0 release notes and changelogs are extensive, and navigating through them to find the list of contributors can be challenging. However, focusing on the names \"Deng,\" \"Jiang,\" and \"Li\" in the contributors list would be a strategic approach.\n- Historical records indicate that Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Li Peng are prominent former Chinese heads of government, and their names are frequently used in international contexts, making them likely candidates for matching.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate Directly to the Contributors Section**:\n   - Use the search functionality on the OpenCV 4.0 release page to directly find the contributors list.\n   - If the contributors list is not directly available, navigate to the detailed changelog and look for a section that mentions contributors.\n\n2. **Focus on Specific Names**:\n   - Once the contributors list is found, focus on names that match \"Deng,\" \"Jiang,\" or \"Li\" to identify the potential match.\n   - If the list is long, use the browser's search function (Ctrl + F) to quickly find these names.\n\n3. **Avoid Redundant Interactions**:\n   - Minimize the number of scrolls and clicks by being precise with each action.\n   - Use the search function to quickly navigate to the relevant sections of the page.\n\n4. **Summarize and Verify**:\n   - Once the potential match is found, summarize the findings and verify the name against the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Navigate to the OpenCV 4.0 release page.\n  - URL: [OpenCV 4.0.0 · opencv/opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0)\n\n- **Step 2**: Use the search function on the page to find the contributors list.\n  - Type \"contributors\" or \"list of contributors\" in the search bar (Ctrl + F).\n\n- **Step 3**: If the contributors list is not directly available, navigate to the detailed changelog.\n  - Click on the \"Changelog\" link if available, or scroll to the section that mentions contributors.\n\n- **Step 4**: Focus on names that match \"Deng,\" \"Jiang,\" or \"Li\".\n  - Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to quickly find these names in the list.\n\n- **Step 5**: Summarize the findings and verify the name against the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n  - Ensure the name matches the Latin alphabet transliteration of a former Chinese head of government.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Use Precise Search Terms**: When searching the page, use precise terms like \"contributors\" or \"list of contributors\" to quickly find the relevant section.\n- **Minimize Scrolling**: Avoid unnecessary scrolling by using the search function to jump to specific sections.\n- **Verify Names**: Double-check the names found against a reliable list of former Chinese heads of government to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Execute the Plan\n\nWebSurfer, please navigate to the OpenCV 4.0 release page at [OpenCV 4.0.0 · opencv/opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0). Use the search function (Ctrl + F) on the page to find the contributors list. Focus on names that match \"Deng,\" \"Jiang,\" or \"Li\". If the contributors list is not directly available, navigate to the detailed changelog and look for a section that mentions contributors.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n- **Incorrect Search Scope**: The search for \"contributors\" was performed in the wrong context, leading to a search results page instead of the desired contributors list.\n- **Lack of Precision in Navigation**: The steps to navigate to the contributors list were not precise enough, causing the web surfer to end up on a different page.\n- **Redundant Actions**: Repeated actions and unnecessary navigation steps led to inefficiency and confusion.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:\n   - Open the OpenCV 4.0 release page: [OpenCV 4.0.0 · opencv/opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0).\n\n2. **Use the Search Function Precisely**:\n   - Use the search function (Ctrl + F) on the page to find the contributors list.\n   - Type \"contributors\" or \"list of contributors\" in the search bar.\n\n3. **Check for Changelog and Detailed Sections**:\n   - If the contributors list is not directly available, click on the \"Changelog\" link or navigate to the detailed changelog section.\n   - Look for a section that mentions contributors.\n\n4. **Focus on Specific Names**:\n   - Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to find names that match \"Deng,\" \"Jiang,\" or \"Li\" in the contributors list.\n\n5. **Summarize and Verify**:\n   - Once a potential match is found, summarize the findings.\n   - Verify the name against a reliable list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n### Hints\n\n- **Use Precise Search Terms**: When searching the page, use precise terms like \"contributors\" or \"list of contributors\" to quickly find the relevant section.\n- **Minimize Scrolling**: Avoid unnecessary scrolling by using the search function to jump to specific sections.\n- **Verify Names**: Double-check the names found against a reliable list of former Chinese heads of government to ensure accuracy.\n- **Stay on the Correct Page**: Ensure that the search is performed on the OpenCV 4.0 release page and not on a search results page.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1**: Open the OpenCV 4.0 release page.\n  - URL: [OpenCV 4.0.0 · opencv/opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0)\n\n- **Step 2**: Use the search function (Ctrl + F) on the page to find the contributors list.\n  - Type \"contributors\" or \"list of contributors\" in the search bar.\n\n- **Step 3**: If the contributors list is not directly available, click on the \"Changelog\" link or navigate to the detailed changelog section.\n  - Look for a section that mentions contributors.\n\n- **Step 4**: Use the search function (Ctrl + F) to find names that match \"Deng,\" \"Jiang,\" or \"Li\" in the contributors list.\n\n- **Step 5**: Summarize the findings and verify the name against the list of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n### Execute the Plan\n\nWebSurfer, please navigate to the OpenCV 4.0 release page at [OpenCV 4.0.0 · opencv/opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.0.0).
