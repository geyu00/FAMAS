Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The language of Tizin arranges sentences as Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n   - \"Pa\" is the nominative form of oneself.\n   - \"Mato\" is the accusative form of oneself.\n   - \"Sing\" is the genitive form of oneself.\n   - \"Maktay\" is the root verb indicating an intense like for something.\n   - \"Maktay\" is used in its root form in the present tense.\n   - \"Tay\" is the preterit past form of \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Aktay\" is the imperfect past form of \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Maktay\" translates better as \"is pleasing to\", where the thing being liked is the object.\n   - \"Apple\" is the nominative form of apples in Tizin.\n   - \"Zapple\" is the accusative form of apples in Tizin.\n   - \"Izapple\" is the genitive form of apples in Tizin.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - No specific facts need to be looked up as all necessary information is provided in the request.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The correct form of the verb \"Maktay\" to use in the present tense.\n   - The correct order of words in the sentence based on the given grammatical structure.\n   - The correct form of \"apples\" as the direct object in the sentence.\n   - The correct form of \"I\" as the subject in the sentence.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The sentence structure will follow the Verb + Direct Object + Subject format.\n   - \"Maktay\" will be used in its root form since the sentence is in the present tense.\n   - \"Zapple\" will be used as the direct object because it is the accusative form of apples.\n   - \"Pa\" will be used as the subject because it is the nominative form of oneself.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Confirm the sentence structure in Tizin: Verb + Direct Object + Subject.\n- Identify the correct verb form for \"like\" in the present tense: \"Maktay\".\n- Use the accusative form of \"apples\" as the direct object: \"Zapple\".\n- Use the nominative form of \"I\" as the subject: \"Pa\".\n- Construct the sentence in Tizin: \"Maktay Zapple Pa\".\n- Review the constructed sentence to ensure it follows the grammatical rules provided.\n- Provide the final translation to the user."}
