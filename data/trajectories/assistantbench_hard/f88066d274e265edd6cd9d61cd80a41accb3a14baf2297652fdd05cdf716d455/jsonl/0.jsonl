It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and new insights:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The trails must be in Yosemite National Park.\n   - The trails must lead to waterfalls.\n   - The trails must have more than 1,000 reviews on TripAdvisor.\n   - The trails must be recommended as fully accessible to wheelchairs by at least three different people.\n   - The trails must have an average rating of 4.5/5 or more on TripAdvisor.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - Specific names of popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park.\n   - Number of reviews for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n   - Average ratings for each trail on TripAdvisor.\n   - Recommendations for wheelchair accessibility for each trail, specifically noting if at least three different people have recommended them as fully accessible.\n\n   **WHERE SPECIFICALLY THEY MIGHT BE FOUND:**\n   - Official Yosemite National Park website for trail information.\n   - TripAdvisor for review counts and average ratings.\n   - Accessible travel guides or forums for recommendations on wheelchair accessibility.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Cross-reference the trails that meet the criteria of having more than 1,000 reviews and a 4.5/5 or higher rating.\n   - Identify which of these trails have been recommended as fully accessible to wheelchairs by at least three different people.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Trails like the Lower Yosemite Falls Trail and the Bridalveil Fall Trail are often mentioned as being more accessible, but their specific ratings and review counts need verification.\n   - The Mist Trail, while popular, is likely not fully accessible to wheelchairs due to its steepness and uneven terrain.\n   - Other popular trails that might be accessible include the Valley Loop Trail and the Cook's Meadow Loop, but their specific accessibility recommendations and ratings need to be verified.\n\n**NEW INSIGHTS AND ADJUSTMENTS:**\n- **Lower Yosemite Falls Trail**: This trail is frequently mentioned as being accessible and is known for its flat terrain, making it a strong candidate for meeting the accessibility criteria.\n- **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: Another trail often cited as accessible, but we need to verify the review counts and ratings.\n- **Valley Loop Trail and Cook's Meadow Loop**: These trails are generally considered easy and might be accessible, but we need to confirm their popularity and ratings on TripAdvisor.\n- **Mist Trail**: While very popular, it is unlikely to meet the accessibility criteria due to its challenging terrain.\n\n**NEXT STEPS:**\n- **Verify Specific Trails on TripAdvisor**:\n  - Navigate to the TripAdvisor pages for the Lower Yosemite Falls Trail, Bridalveil Fall Trail, Valley Loop Trail, and Cook's Meadow Loop.\n  - Check the number of reviews, average ratings, and user comments regarding wheelchair accessibility.\n- **Cross-Reference with Accessible Travel Guides**:\n  - Search for accessible travel guides or forums to find additional recommendations and verify the accessibility of the trails.\n\nBy focusing on these specific trails and verifying the necessary details, we can narrow down the list to those that meet all the criteria.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inadequate Navigation and Information Extraction**:\n   - The initial search did not yield the specific trail names and details needed.\n   - The subsequent navigation to the AllTrails page did not result in the extraction of the required information, possibly due to incomplete scrolling or lack of focus on the relevant sections of the page.\n\n2. **Lack of Clear Instructions**:\n   - The instructions provided to WebSurfer were not specific enough to ensure that the necessary information was extracted from the pages.\n\n3. **Insufficient Verification**:\n   - There was no clear step to verify the review counts, ratings, and accessibility recommendations on TripAdvisor.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Search for Popular Trails**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a search for \"popular waterfall trails in Yosemite National Park\" on a reliable source like AllTrails or a similar hiking guide.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down the page and extract the names of the trails listed as popular waterfall trails.\n\n2. **Navigate to TripAdvisor Pages**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: For each trail identified, navigate to the corresponding TripAdvisor page.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Verify the number of reviews and the average rating for each trail.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Check user comments and reviews for mentions of wheelchair accessibility. Specifically look for at least three different users recommending the trail as fully accessible.\n\n3. **Compile and Present Findings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Summarize the findings, including the names of the trails that meet all the criteria.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Provide links to the relevant TripAdvisor pages for reference.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n- **Step 1: Search for Popular Trails**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"popular waterfall trails in Yosemite National Park\" on AllTrails.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Scroll down the page and note down the names of the trails listed as popular waterfall trails.\n\n- **Step 2: Navigate to TripAdvisor Pages**\n  - **WebSurfer**: For each trail identified, navigate to the corresponding TripAdvisor page.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Verify the number of reviews and the average rating for each trail.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Check user comments and reviews for mentions of wheelchair accessibility.

EDUCATED GUESSES\n- **Lower Yosemite Falls Trail**: This trail is frequently mentioned as being accessible and is known for its flat terrain, making it a strong candidate for meeting the accessibility criteria.\n- **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: Another trail often cited as accessible, but we need to verify the review counts and ratings.\n- **Valley Loop Trail and Cook's Meadow Loop**: These trails are generally considered easy and might be accessible, but we need to confirm their popularity and ratings on TripAdvisor.\n- **Mist Trail**: While very popular, it is unlikely to meet the accessibility criteria due to its challenging terrain.\n- **Vernal Fall Footbridge and Nevada Fall Trail**: These trails are popular but are less likely to be fully accessible due to their terrain.\n\n**NEW INSIGHTS AND ADJUSTMENTS:**\n- **Lower Yosemite Falls Trail**: This trail is frequently mentioned as being accessible and is known for its flat terrain, making it a strong candidate for meeting the accessibility criteria.\n- **Bridalveil Fall Trail**: Another trail often cited as accessible, but we need to verify the review counts and ratings.\n- **Valley Loop Trail and Cook's Meadow Loop**: These trails are generally considered easy and might be accessible, but we need to confirm their popularity and ratings on TripAdvisor.\n- **Mist Trail**: While very popular, it is unlikely to meet the accessibility criteria due to its challenging terrain.\n- **Vernal Fall Footbridge and Nevada Fall Trail**: These trails are popular but are less likely to be fully accessible due to their terrain.\n\n**ADDITIONAL HUNCHES:**\n- **Mirror Lake Trail**: This trail is known for its relatively flat terrain and is often recommended for its scenic beauty.
