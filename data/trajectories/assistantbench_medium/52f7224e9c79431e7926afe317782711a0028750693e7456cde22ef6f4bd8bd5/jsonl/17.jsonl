{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the highest rated (according to IMDB) Isabelle Adjani feature film that is less than 2 hours and is available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) to buy or rent?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The film must be a feature film starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The film must have an IMDB rating.\n   - The film must be less than 2 hours long.\n   - The film must be available on Vudu (now called Fandango at Home) for purchase or rental.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The list of all feature films starring Isabelle Adjani.\n   - The IMDB ratings for each of these films.\n   - The runtime of each of these films.\n   - The availability of each of these films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The highest-rated film among those that meet all the criteria (IMDB rating, runtime, and availability on Fandango at Home).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Isabelle Adjani has starred in several critically acclaimed films, so it is likely that one of her films meets the criteria.\n   - Given her prominence in French cinema, some of her films may have high IMDB ratings.\n   - Many classic and contemporary films are available on streaming platforms like Fandango at Home, so it is plausible that at least one of her films is available there.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Step 1**: Use WebSurfer to search for a comprehensive list of Isabelle Adjani's feature films on a reliable source like IMDb.\n- **Step 2**: Use WebSurfer to navigate to each film's IMDb page to gather the following information:\n  - IMDB rating\n  - Runtime\n- **Step 3**: Filter the list to include only films that are less than 2 hours long.\n- **Step 4**: Use WebSurfer to check the availability of the filtered films on Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).\n- **Step 5**: Identify the highest-rated film from the filtered and available list.\n- **Step 6**: Verify the final selection and provide the answer."}
