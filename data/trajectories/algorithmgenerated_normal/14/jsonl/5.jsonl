To accurately find it, I will perform a search to identify the book in which two James Beard Award winners recommended the Frontier Restaurant or the breakfast burrito.\n\nBased on my knowledge, I believe the book \"New Mexican Cuisine: Recipes from the Land of Enchantment\" is a possibility as it features several recommendations that might include the Frontier Restaurant and its famous breakfast burrito. However, we need to confirm the title of this book and see if it indeed includes recommendations by two James Beard Award winners.\n\nPlease allow me to verify this information accurately. \n\nIf there are any other known books that might contain recommendations from the award-winning chefs, I would also consider those.\n\n### Suggested Book Search Code\n```python\n# This Python code can be used to search for books related to New Mexican cuisine\n# and check for mentions of James Beard Award winners and the Frontier Restaurant.\n\nimport requests\n\ndef search_books(query):\n    url = \"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes\"\n    params = {\n        'q': query,\n        'maxResults': 10,\n        'key': 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'  # Replace with a valid Google Books API key\n    }\n    response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n    return response.json()\n\n# Searching for the book using the terms\nbook_results = search_books(\"New Mexican Cuisine Frontier Restaurant James Beard Award\")\nbook_results\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to gather information on the relevant books.
