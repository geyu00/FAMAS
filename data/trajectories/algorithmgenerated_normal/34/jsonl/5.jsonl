How many wheels do the listed steam locomotives have in total?

Segregate the steam locomotive configurations from others.\n2. Calculate the total number of wheels for each steam locomotive configuration using the Whyte notation.\n3. Sum the total number of wheels for all the steam locomotives.\n\n## Output format\nThe total number of wheels on the listed steam locomotives.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The file must be correctly read and interpreted.\n- The wheel configuration must be accurately identified for each steam locomotive.\n- The total wheel count must be verified for accuracy.\n\n## Results (including code blocks) and reason from last response\n- File path: ../2023/validation/54612da3-fd56-4941-80f4-5eb82330de25.xlsx\n- Relevant code block:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the Excel file\nfile_path = \"../2023/validation/54612da3-fd56-4941-80f4-5eb82330de25.xlsx\"\ndata = pd.read_excel(file_path)\n\n# Extract the 'Type/Wheel Configuration' column\nwheel_configurations = data['Type/Wheel Configuration'].dropna().unique()\n\n# Display the unique wheel configurations\nprint(wheel_configurations)\n```"}

Each digit in the notation represents the number of wheels on each part of the locomotive: leading wheels, driving wheels, and trailing wheels. \n\nHere is the breakdown for each configuration:\n- '0-4-0': 0 + 4 + 0 = 4 wheels\n- '4-4-0': 4 + 4 + 0 = 8 wheels\n- '2-6-0': 2 + 6 + 0 = 8 wheels\n- '2-8-0': 2 + 8 + 0 = 10 wheels\n- '2-6-4': 2 + 6 + 4 = 12 wheels\n- '2-8-4': 2 + 8 + 4 = 14 wheels\n\nNow I'll compute the total number of wheels for these configurations. Let's implement that in code. \n\n```python\n# Wheel configurations\nwheel_configurations = ['0-4-0', '4-4-0', '2-6-0', '2-8-0', '2-6-4', '2-8-4']\n\n# Function to calculate total wheels based on Whyte notation\ndef calculate_wheels(wheel_config):\n    parts = list(map(int, wheel_config.split('-')))\n    return sum(parts)\n\n# Calculate total wheels for each configuration\ntotal_wheels = sum(calculate_wheels(config) for config in wheel_configurations)\n\n# Display the total number of wheels\nprint(total_wheels)\n```"}
