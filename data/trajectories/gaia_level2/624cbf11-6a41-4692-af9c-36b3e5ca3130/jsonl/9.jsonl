Established in 1997, the graveyard features granite headstones for flavors that have been retired, each with a clever epitaph and dates of birth and death. The graveyard began with just four flavors, including Dastardly Mash, Economic Crunch, Ethan Almond, and Tuskegee Chunk. Over the years, it has expanded to include many more flavors, with a total of around 35 flavors currently represented. Tasting Table\n+1\nDastardly Mash\nFlavor Profile: Dastardly Mash was a unique blend that combined various ingredients, making it a memorable offering during its time.\nDates: This flavor was one of the first to be retired, marking its headstone as the oldest in the graveyard. The exact dates of its introduction and retirement are often humorously inscribed on the headstone, reflecting the playful spirit of Ben & Jerry's branding.\nVisual Representation\nWhile I cannot provide a detailed photo from 2022, the headstone for Dastardly Mash, like others in the graveyard, features a granite marker with a witty epitaph that captures the essence of the flavor. Visitors to the graveyard can see these headstones during factory tours, which often include a narrative about the flavors and their stories.\nRead more\nThe Truth About Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard - Tasting Table\nBen & Jerry's created the Flavor Graveyard as a way for customers to mourn the loss of their favorite flavors that were no longer available in stores.

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and new insights:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The reference point for the information is the end of 2022.\n   - The oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard commemorates the flavor \"Dastardly Mash,\" which was one of the original flavors interred when the graveyard opened in 1997.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The photo of the Dastardly Mash headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The text, specifically the last line of the rhyme, under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the Dastardly Mash headstone.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard likely contains detailed information about retired flavors, including photos and rhymes.\n   - The oldest flavor's headstone (Dastardly Mash) is probably prominently featured or clearly labeled on the website.\n   - The background headstone in the photo might be a well-known or significant flavor, which could help in identifying the specific rhyme.\n   - Given the difficulty in accessing the official Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page, alternative sources such as fan sites, blog posts, or archived images might provide the necessary details.\n   - The headstone visible in the background of the Dastardly Mash headstone photo might be one of the other original flavors interred in 1997, such as \"Economic Crunch,\" \"Ethan Almond,\" or \"Tuskegee Chunk.\"\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Alternative Sources:** Since the official Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page is inaccessible, it is reasonable to assume that fan sites, blog posts, and archived images might have detailed photos and descriptions of the graveyard, including the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n- **Original Flavors:** The original flavors interred in 1997 are likely to be prominently featured in any detailed description or photo of the graveyard, making them strong candidates for the background headstone in the Dastardly Mash headstone photo.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Access Issues**: The official Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page was inaccessible, leading to a dead end in our primary source of information.\n2. **Limited Search Results**: Searches for detailed blog posts or fan sites did not yield specific information about the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n3. **Inadequate Image Search**: The image search did not provide high-resolution images or detailed descriptions of the headstones.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific and targeted search queries to find detailed descriptions or high-resolution images of the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n   - Example queries: \"Ben & Jerry's Dastardly Mash headstone detailed photo 2022\", \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard original flavors 1997 detailed photos\".\n\n2. **Explore Multiple Sources**:\n   - Search for fan sites, travel blogs, and articles that provide detailed descriptions or tours of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example sources: travel blogs, ice cream enthusiast forums, and local Vermont tourism websites.\n\n3. **Use Image Recognition Tools**:\n   - If detailed photos are found, use image recognition tools to enhance the visibility of the background headstone and extract the text.\n   - Example tools: Google Lens, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.\n\n4. **Check Social Media and Forums**:\n   - Search social media platforms and forums for user-generated content, such as photos and descriptions of visits to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example platforms: Instagram, Reddit, Facebook groups.\n\n5. **Contact WebSurfer for Detailed Searches**:\n   - Ask WebSurfer to perform detailed searches on the identified sources and extract specific information about the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n   - Example: \"Search for detailed blog posts or fan sites that describe the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, particularly focusing on the Dastardly Mash headstone and the headstone visible in the background, from the end of 2022.\"\n\n6. **Summarize and Verify**:\n   - Once the information is gathered, summarize the findings and verify the last line of the rhyme on the background headstone.\n   - Example: \"Provide the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the Dastardly Mash headstone.\"\n\n### Steps to Execute the New Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Refine search queries and explore multiple sources.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a detailed search using the refined queries.\n  - **Example Query**: \"Ben & Jerry's Dastardly Mash headstone detailed photo 2022\"\n\n- **Step 2**: Check social media and forums for user-generated content.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups for photos and descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n\n- **Step 3**: Use image recognition tools if detailed photos are found.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Download high-resolution images and use Google Lens or OCR to extract text.\n\n- **Step 4**: Contact WebSurfer for detailed searches on identified sources.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for detailed blog posts or fan sites that describe the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, particularly focusing on the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n\n- **Step 5**: Summarize and verify the information.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Extract the last line of the rhyme on the background headstone.\n  - **Assistant**: Provide the final answer.\n\nBy following this new plan, we aim to overcome the previous challenges and successfully find the last line of the rhyme on the background headstone."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and new insights:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The reference point for the information is the end of 2022.\n   - The oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard commemorates the flavor \"Dastardly Mash,\" which was one of the original flavors interred when the graveyard opened in 1997.\n   - The official Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page is currently inaccessible.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - High-resolution photos of the Dastardly Mash headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The text, specifically the last line of the rhyme, under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the Dastardly Mash headstone.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Fan Sites and Blog Posts:** Alternative sources such as fan sites, travel blogs, and local Vermont tourism websites are likely to have detailed descriptions or tours of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, including high-resolution photos of the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n   - **Original Flavors:** The headstone visible in the background of the Dastardly Mash headstone photo might be one of the other original flavors interred in 1997, such as \"Economic Crunch,\" \"Ethan Almond,\" or \"Tuskegee Chunk.\"\n   - **Social Media and User-Generated Content:** Platforms like Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups might contain user-generated content, such as photos and descriptions of visits to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, which could provide the necessary details.\n   - **Archived Images:** Archived images or screenshots of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard from 2022 might still be available through web archives or image search engines.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Alternative Sources:** Given the inaccessibility of the official Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page, fan sites, travel blogs, and local Vermont tourism websites are strong candidates for detailed information and high-resolution photos.\n- **Original Flavors:** The original flavors interred in 1997 are likely to be prominently featured in any detailed description or photo of the graveyard, making them strong candidates for the background headstone in the Dastardly Mash headstone photo.\n- **Social Media and User-Generated Content:** User-generated content on social media platforms can often provide valuable insights and detailed photos that are not available on official websites.\n- **Archived Images:** Web archives and image search engines can sometimes provide historical data and images that are no longer available on the current version of a website.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Search Fan Sites and Travel Blogs:**\n   - Perform a detailed search on fan sites, travel blogs, and local Vermont tourism websites for detailed descriptions or tours of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example queries: \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard tour 2022\", \"Ben & Jerry's Dastardly Mash headstone detailed photo 2022\".\n\n2. **Check Social Media and User-Generated Content:**\n   - Search social media platforms like Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups for user-generated content, such as photos and descriptions of visits to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example platforms: Instagram, Reddit, Facebook groups.\n\n3. **Use Web Archives and Image Search Engines:**\n   - Search web archives and image search engines for archived images or screenshots of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard from 2022.\n   - Example tools: Wayback Machine, Google Images.\n\n4. **Contact WebSurfer for Detailed Searches:**\n   - Ask WebSurfer to perform detailed searches on the identified sources and extract specific information about the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n   - Example: \"Search for detailed blog posts or fan sites that describe the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, particularly focusing on the Dastardly Mash headstone and the headstone visible in the background, from the end of 2022.\"\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to gather the necessary information to identify the last line of the rhyme on the background headstone.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Ineffective Search Queries**: The search queries used were not specific enough to yield the detailed information needed, such as high-resolution photos of the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n2. **Limited Exploration of Sources**: The search was primarily focused on search engines and did not fully leverage fan sites, travel blogs, social media, and web archives.\n3. **Inadequate Image Analysis**: There was no attempt to use image recognition tools or detailed image analysis to extract text from the photos found.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific and targeted search queries to find detailed descriptions or high-resolution images of the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n   - Example queries: \"Ben & Jerry's Dastardly Mash headstone detailed photo 2022 high resolution\", \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard original flavors 1997 detailed photos\".\n\n2. **Explore Multiple Sources**:\n   - Search fan sites, travel blogs, and local Vermont tourism websites for detailed descriptions or tours of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example sources: travel blogs, ice cream enthusiast forums, and local Vermont tourism websites.\n\n3. **Check Social Media and User-Generated Content**:\n   - Search social media platforms like Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups for user-generated content, such as photos and descriptions of visits to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example platforms: Instagram, Reddit, Facebook groups.\n\n4. **Use Web Archives and Image Search Engines**:\n   - Search web archives and image search engines for archived images or screenshots of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard from 2022.\n   - Example tools: Wayback Machine, Google Images.\n\n5. **Utilize Image Recognition Tools**:\n   - If detailed photos are found, use image recognition tools to enhance the visibility of the background headstone and extract the text.\n   - Example tools: Google Lens, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.\n\n6. **Contact WebSurfer for Detailed Searches**:\n   - Ask WebSurfer to perform detailed searches on the identified sources and extract specific information about the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n   - Example: \"Search for detailed blog posts or fan sites that describe the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, particularly focusing on the Dastardly Mash headstone and the headstone visible in the background, from the end of 2022.\"\n\n7. **Summarize and Verify Information**:\n   - Once the information is gathered, summarize the findings and verify the last line of the rhyme on the background headstone.\n   - Example: \"Provide the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the Dastardly Mash headstone.\"\n\n### Steps to Execute the New Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Refine search queries and explore multiple sources.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a detailed search using the refined queries.\n  - **Example Query**: \"Ben & Jerry's Dastardly Mash headstone detailed photo 2022 high resolution\"\n\n- **Step 2**: Check social media and user-generated content.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups for photos and descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n\n- **Step 3**: Use web archives and image search engines.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search the Wayback Machine and Google Images for archived images or screenshots of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard from 2022.\n\n- **Step 4**: Utilize image recognition tools.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Download high-resolution images and use Google Lens or OCR to extract text.\n\n- **Step 5**: Contact WebSurfer for detailed searches on identified sources.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for detailed blog posts or fan sites that describe the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, particularly focusing on the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n\n- **Step 6**: Summarize and verify the information.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Extract the last line of the rhyme on the background headstone.\n  - **Assistant**: Provide the final answer."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat's the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard as of the end of 2022?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and new insights:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The reference point for the information is the end of 2022.\n   - The oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard commemorates the flavor \"Dastardly Mash,\" which was one of the original flavors interred when the graveyard opened in 1997.\n   - The official Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page is currently inaccessible.\n   - The Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard is a physical location in Waterbury, Vermont, and is also featured online.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - High-resolution photos of the Dastardly Mash headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The text, specifically the last line of the rhyme, under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the Dastardly Mash headstone.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Fan Sites and Blog Posts:** Alternative sources such as fan sites, travel blogs, and local Vermont tourism websites are likely to have detailed descriptions or tours of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, including high-resolution photos of the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n     - **Reasoning:** These sources often provide detailed and personal accounts of visits to the flavor graveyard, which may include high-resolution photos and specific details about the headstones.\n   - **Original Flavors:** The headstone visible in the background of the Dastardly Mash headstone photo might be one of the other original flavors interred in 1997, such as \"Economic Crunch,\" \"Ethan Almond,\" or \"Tuskegee Chunk.\"\n     - **Reasoning:** The original flavors are likely to be prominently featured and well-documented in any detailed description or photo of the graveyard.\n   - **Social Media and User-Generated Content:** Platforms like Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups might contain user-generated content, such as photos and descriptions of visits to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, which could provide the necessary details.\n     - **Reasoning:** User-generated content can often provide valuable insights and detailed photos that are not available on official websites.\n   - **Archived Images:** Archived images or screenshots of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard from 2022 might still be available through web archives or image search engines.\n     - **Reasoning:** Web archives and image search engines can sometimes provide historical data and images that are no longer available on the current version of a website.\n   - **Local Vermont Tourism Websites:** Local tourism websites and blogs may have detailed guides or articles about the Ben & Jerry's factory and the flavor graveyard, which could include high-resolution photos and specific details.\n     - **Reasoning:** Local tourism websites often provide comprehensive information to attract visitors, including detailed descriptions and high-quality images.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Search Fan Sites and Travel Blogs:**\n   - Perform a detailed search on fan sites, travel blogs, and local Vermont tourism websites for detailed descriptions or tours of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example queries: \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard tour 2022\", \"Ben & Jerry's Dastardly Mash headstone detailed photo 2022\".\n\n2. **Check Social Media and User-Generated Content:**\n   - Search social media platforms like Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups for user-generated content, such as photos and descriptions of visits to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example platforms: Instagram, Reddit, Facebook groups.\n\n3. **Use Web Archives and Image Search Engines:**\n   - Search web archives and image search engines for archived images or screenshots of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard from 2022.\n   - Example tools: Wayback Machine, Google Images.\n\n4. **Contact WebSurfer for Detailed Searches:**\n   - Ask WebSurfer to perform detailed searches on the identified sources and extract specific information about the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n   - Example: \"Search for detailed blog posts or fan sites that describe the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, particularly focusing on the Dastardly Mash headstone and the headstone visible in the background, from the end of 2022.\"\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to gather the necessary information to identify the last line of the rhyme on the background headstone.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Ineffective Search Queries**: The search queries used were too broad and did not yield the specific high-resolution photos or detailed descriptions needed.\n2. **Limited Exploration of Sources**: The search was primarily focused on search engines and did not fully leverage fan sites, travel blogs, social media, and web archives.\n3. **Lack of Specificity**: The search terms did not target the exact information required, such as the last line of the rhyme on the background headstone.\n4. **No Image Analysis**: There was no attempt to use image recognition tools to extract text from the photos found.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific and targeted search queries to find detailed descriptions or high-resolution images of the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n   - Example queries: \"Ben & Jerry's Dastardly Mash headstone detailed photo 2022 high resolution\", \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard original flavors 1997 detailed photos\".\n\n2. **Explore Multiple Sources**:\n   - Search fan sites, travel blogs, and local Vermont tourism websites for detailed descriptions or tours of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example sources: travel blogs, ice cream enthusiast forums, and local Vermont tourism websites.\n\n3. **Check Social Media and User-Generated Content**:\n   - Search social media platforms like Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups for user-generated content, such as photos and descriptions of visits to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example platforms: Instagram, Reddit, Facebook groups.\n\n4. **Use Web Archives and Image Search Engines**:\n   - Search web archives and image search engines for archived images or screenshots of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard from 2022.\n   - Example tools: Wayback Machine, Google Images.\n\n5. **Utilize Image Recognition Tools**:\n   - If detailed photos are found, use image recognition tools to enhance the visibility of the background headstone and extract the text.\n   - Example tools: Google Lens, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.\n\n6. **Contact WebSurfer for Detailed Searches**:\n   - Ask WebSurfer to perform detailed searches on the identified sources and extract specific information about the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n   - Example: \"Search for detailed blog posts or fan sites that describe the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, particularly focusing on the Dastardly Mash headstone and the headstone visible in the background, from the end of 2022.\"\n\n7. **Summarize and Verify Information**:\n   - Once the information is gathered, summarize the findings and verify the last line of the rhyme on the background headstone.\n   - Example: \"Provide the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the Dastardly Mash headstone.\"\n\n### Steps to Execute the New Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Refine search queries and explore multiple sources.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a detailed search using the refined queries.\n  - **Example Query**: \"Ben & Jerry's Dastardly Mash headstone detailed photo 2022 high resolution\"\n\n- **Step 2**: Check social media and user-generated content.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups for photos and descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n\n- **Step 3**: Use web archives and image search engines.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search the Wayback Machine and Google Images for archived images or screenshots of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard from 2022.\n\n- **Step 4**: Utilize image recognition tools.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Download high-resolution images and use Google Lens or OCR to extract text.\n\n- **Step 5**: Contact WebSurfer for detailed searches on identified sources.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for detailed blog posts or fan sites that describe the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, particularly focusing on the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n\n- **Step 6**: Summarize and verify the information.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Extract the last line of the rhyme on the background headstone.\n  - **Assistant**: Provide the final answer."}

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet based on our progress and new insights:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The reference point for the information is the end of 2022.\n   - The oldest flavor's headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard commemorates the flavor \"Dastardly Mash,\" which was one of the original flavors interred when the graveyard opened in 1997.\n   - The official Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard page is currently inaccessible.\n   - The Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard is a physical location in Waterbury, Vermont, and is also featured online.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - High-resolution photos of the Dastardly Mash headstone in the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard.\n   - The text, specifically the last line of the rhyme, under the flavor name on the headstone visible in the background of the photo of the Dastardly Mash headstone.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - None.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **Fan Sites and Blog Posts:** Alternative sources such as fan sites, travel blogs, and local Vermont tourism websites are likely to have detailed descriptions or tours of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, including high-resolution photos of the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n     - **Reasoning:** These sources often provide detailed and personal accounts of visits to the flavor graveyard, which may include high-resolution photos and specific details about the headstones.\n   - **Original Flavors:** The headstone visible in the background of the Dastardly Mash headstone photo might be one of the other original flavors interred in 1997, such as \"Economic Crunch,\" \"Ethan Almond,\" or \"Tuskegee Chunk.\"\n     - **Reasoning:** The original flavors are likely to be prominently featured and well-documented in any detailed description or photo of the graveyard.\n   - **Social Media and User-Generated Content:** Platforms like Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups might contain user-generated content, such as photos and descriptions of visits to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, which could provide the necessary details.\n     - **Reasoning:** User-generated content can often provide valuable insights and detailed photos that are not available on official websites.\n   - **Archived Images:** Archived images or screenshots of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard from 2022 might still be available through web archives or image search engines.\n     - **Reasoning:** Web archives and image search engines can sometimes provide historical data and images that are no longer available on the current version of a website.\n   - **Local Vermont Tourism Websites:** Local tourism websites and blogs may have detailed guides or articles about the Ben & Jerry's factory and the flavor graveyard, which could include high-resolution photos and specific details.\n     - **Reasoning:** Local tourism websites often provide comprehensive information to attract visitors, including detailed descriptions and high-quality images.\n   - **Specific Search Terms:** Using more specific and targeted search terms might help in finding the required high-resolution photos or detailed descriptions.\n     - **Reasoning:** Broad search terms have not yielded the desired results, so narrowing down the search terms could be more effective.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries:**\n   - Use more specific and targeted search queries to find detailed descriptions or high-resolution images of the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n   - Example queries: \"Ben & Jerry's Dastardly Mash headstone detailed photo 2022 high resolution\", \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard original flavors 1997 detailed photos\".\n\n2. **Explore Multiple Sources:**\n   - Search fan sites, travel blogs, and local Vermont tourism websites for detailed descriptions or tours of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example sources: travel blogs, ice cream enthusiast forums, and local Vermont tourism websites.\n\n3. **Check Social Media and User-Generated Content:**\n   - Search social media platforms like Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups for user-generated content, such as photos and descriptions of visits to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example platforms: Instagram, Reddit, Facebook groups.\n\n4. **Use Web Archives and Image Search Engines:**\n   - Search web archives and image search engines for archived images or screenshots of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard from 2022.\n   - Example tools: Wayback Machine, Google Images.\n\n5. **Utilize Image Recognition Tools:**\n   - If detailed photos are found, use image recognition tools to enhance the visibility of the background headstone and extract the text.\n   - Example tools: Google Lens, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.\n\n6. **Contact WebSurfer for Detailed Searches:**\n   - Ask WebSurfer to perform detailed searches on the identified sources and extract specific information about the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n   - Example: \"Search for detailed blog posts or fan sites that describe the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, particularly focusing on the Dastardly Mash headstone and the headstone visible in the background, from the end of 2022.\"\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries:**\n   - Use the following specific and targeted search queries:\n     - \"Ben & Jerry's Dastardly Mash headstone detailed photo 2022 high resolution\"\n     - \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard original flavors 1997 detailed photos\"\n     - \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard tour 2022 high resolution photos\"\n\n2. **Explore Multiple Sources:**\n   - Search fan sites, travel blogs, and local Vermont tourism websites for detailed descriptions or tours of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - Example sources: travel blogs, ice cream enthusiast forums, and local Vermont tourism websites.\n\n3. **Check Social Media and User-Generated Content:**\n   - Search social media platforms like Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups for user-generated content, such as photos and descriptions of visits to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   -

Example: \"Search for detailed blog posts or fan sites that describe the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, particularly focusing on the Dastardly Mash headstone and the headstone visible in the background, from the end of 2022.\"\n\n### Steps to Execute the Updated Plan\n\n- **Step 1**: Refine search queries and explore multiple sources.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Perform a detailed search using the refined queries.\n  - **Example Query**: \"Ben & Jerry's Dastardly Mash headstone detailed photo 2022 high resolution\"\n\n- **Step 2**: Check social media and user-generated content.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups for photos and descriptions of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n\n- **Step 3**: Use web archives and image search engines.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search the Wayback Machine and Google Images for archived images or screenshots of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard from 2022.\n\n- **Step 4**: Utilize image recognition tools.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Download high-resolution images and use Google Lens or OCR to extract text.\n\n- **Step 5**: Contact WebSurfer for detailed searches on identified sources.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for detailed blog posts or fan sites that describe the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard, particularly focusing on the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n\n- **Step 6**: Summarize and verify the information.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Extract the last line of the rhyme on the background headstone.\n  - **Assistant**: Provide the final answer.\n\nPlease proceed with the refined search queries and explore the identified sources.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Broad and Ineffective Search Queries**: The search queries used were too broad and did not yield the specific high-resolution photos or detailed descriptions needed.\n2. **Limited Exploration of Sources**: The search was primarily focused on search engines and did not fully leverage fan sites, travel blogs, social media, and web archives.\n3. **Lack of Specificity**: The search terms did not target the exact information required, such as the last line of the rhyme on the background headstone.\n4. **No Image Analysis**: There was no attempt to use image recognition tools to extract text from the photos found.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - Use more specific and targeted search queries to find detailed descriptions or high-resolution images of the Dastardly Mash headstone and the background headstone.\n   - **Example Queries**:\n     - \"Ben & Jerry's Dastardly Mash headstone detailed photo 2022 high resolution\"\n     - \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard original flavors 1997 detailed photos\"\n     - \"Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard tour 2022 high resolution photos\"\n\n2. **Explore Multiple Sources**:\n   - Search fan sites, travel blogs, and local Vermont tourism websites for detailed descriptions or tours of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - **Example Sources**:\n     - Travel blogs (e.g., Atlas Obscura, TripAdvisor)\n     - Ice cream enthusiast forums\n     - Local Vermont tourism websites\n\n3. **Check Social Media and User-Generated Content**:\n   - Search social media platforms like Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook groups for user-generated content, such as photos and descriptions of visits to the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard.\n   - **Example Platforms**:\n     - Instagram (search hashtags like #BenAndJerrysGraveyard, #DastardlyMash)\n     - Reddit (subreddits like r/icecream, r/benandjerrys)\n     - Facebook groups (search for Ben & Jerry's fan groups)\n\n4. **Use Web Archives and Image Search Engines**:\n   - Search web archives and image search engines for archived images or screenshots of the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard from 2022.\n   - **Example Tools**:\n     - Wayback Machine\n     - Google Images\n\n5. **Utilize Image Recognition Tools**:\n   -
