The image processing expert will analyze the image and extract all the fractions using / as the fraction line.\n2. The mathematical problem-solving expert will solve the extracted fractions.\n3. The checker will verify the accuracy of the extracted fractions and their solutions.\n## Output format\nProvide a comma-separated list with no whitespace, containing all the fractions and their solutions in the order they appear in the image.\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure all fractions using / as the fraction line are accurately extracted.\n- Ensure all sample problems are correctly solved.\n- Provide the output in the specified format.\n## Results from last response\nFinal Result: 3/4,1/4,2/4,5/35,1/21,30/5,3/4,1/4,1/2,1/7,1/21,6\n## Reason for the results\nThe team followed a structured plan:\n1. The ImageProcessing_Expert used OCR to extract text from the image, identifying the fractions.\n2. The ProblemSolving_Expert simplified and solved the fractions.\n3. The Verification_Expert compiled and verified the results.\n## Errors or issues in the conversation\n- The final result includes unsimplified fractions (2/4, 5/35, 30/5) alongside their simplified forms (1/2, 1/7, 6).
