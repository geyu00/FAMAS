Retrieve the original article from Project MUSE using the provided DOI.\n2. Locate the quoted text on pages 45-46 of the article.\n3. Compare the quoted text with the in-line citation to check for any discrepancies.\n4. Verify the accuracy of the comparison.\n\n## Output format\n- Answer Yes if the quoted text matches the article.\n- If not, provide the word in the citation that does not match with the correct one (without any article).\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Ensure the original article is retrieved and the quoted text is accurately compared.\n- Provide a clear and concise answer based on the comparison."}

This could be due to the placeholder search criteria not matching the actual structure of the retrieved article. \n\nGiven that we do not have the real content of the article to work with, I would recommend adjusting the method of extraction based on the actual text formatting. \n\nHowever, we need to compare the relevant quote found on pages 45-46 with the in-line citation provided. Instead of relying on the content extraction, I will assume that we proceed with a manual comparison if the actual text from those pages could be referenced.\n\nOnce we have the actual text from pages 45-46, we can check the quoted text from the in-line citation:\n\n> “obscured not by a 'cloak of print' but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission” (Greetham 45-46).\n\nIf we were able to retrieve and analyze that text, we would compare it directly for any discrepancies. \n\nFor now, if we could have the accurate text or confirm if there was another way to access the original text more directly, we could resolve the verification process.

Given the current circumstances, since we weren't able to extract the text directly and are lacking the accurate quote from the article, I suggest the following next steps:\n\n1. **Manual Verification**: If someone can access the article from Project MUSE using the DOI directly, they can retrieve the exact wording from pages 45-46 and perform the comparison manually.\n  \n2. **Providing Original Text**: If you happen to have access to the original text or know someone who does, sharing the relevant quote here would allow us to verify the in-line citation immediately.\n\n3. **Alternative Text Verification**: If there's an alternate source or database from which we can obtain this article or a reference to it, I would gladly assist in verifying the quote.\n\nLet me know how you would like to proceed!"}
