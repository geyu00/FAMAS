Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nFind the year in which the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas) according to the USGS.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The USGS data specialist will search the historical records for the first sighting of the American Alligator west of Texas.\n2. The wildlife biologist will provide context and additional information about the sighting.\n3.
