Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The sentence structure in Tizin is Verb-Object-Subject.\n   - \"Pa\" is the nominative form of oneself.\n   - \"Mato\" is the accusative form of oneself.\n   - \"Sing\" is the genitive form of oneself.\n   - \"Maktay\" is the root verb indicating an intense like for something.\n   - \"Maktay\" in the present tense is used in its root form.\n   - \"Tay\" is the preterit past form of \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Aktay\" is the imperfect past form of \"Maktay\".\n   - \"Maktay\" translates better as \"is pleasing to\".\n   - \"Apple\" is the nominative form of apples.\n   - \"Zapple\" is the accusative form of apples.\n   - \"Izapple\" is the genitive form of apples.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - No specific facts need to be looked up as all necessary information is provided in the request.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The correct form of \"Maktay\" to use in the present tense (which is given as \"Maktay\").\n   - The correct order of words in the sentence based on the provided structure (Verb-Object-Subject).\n   - The correct forms of \"Pa\" and \"Apple\" to use in the sentence based on their roles (object and subject).\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The sentence \"I like apples\" in Tizin will likely use the present tense form of \"Maktay\" since it describes a current state.\n   - The sentence structure will follow the Verb-Object-Subject order.\n   - \"Apple\" will be in the accusative form \"Zapple\" because it is the object of the sentence.\n   - \"Pa\" will be in the nominative form because it is the subject of the sentence.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Confirm the sentence structure and verb conjugation rules from the given information.\n- Identify the correct forms of the words to be used in the sentence.\n- Construct the sentence \"I like apples\" in Tizin using the identified forms and structure.\n- Verify the constructed sentence against the given rules to ensure accuracy.\n- Provide the final translation to the user."}
