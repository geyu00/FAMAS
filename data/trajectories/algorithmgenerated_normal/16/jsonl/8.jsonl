Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nIdentify the specific number mentioned by the narrator directly after dinosaurs are first shown in the YouTube 360 VR video from March 2018 narrated by the voice actor of Lord of the Rings' Gollum.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Ensure the correct usage of the YouTube Data API to locate the specific video.\n2. Locate the specific YouTube 360 VR video from March 2018 narrated by the voice actor of Lord of the Rings' Gollum.\n3. Watch the video and find the moment when dinosaurs are first shown.\n4. Listen to the narration immediately after the dinosaurs are shown to identify the number mentioned.\n\n## Output format\n- The specific number mentioned by the narrator directly after dinosaurs are first shown.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The task is completed when the specific number mentioned by the narrator directly after the dinosaurs are first shown is identified and provided.\n\n## Results from last response\nThe experts were unable to identify the specific YouTube video ID required to locate and analyze the video.

{"agent": "Video_Analyst_Expert", "content": "To proceed with the task, I'll start by using the YouTube Data API to search for the specific 360 VR video from March 2018 narrated by the voice actor known for playing Gollum. \n\nLet's set up a Python script to search for this video based on the specified criteria: \n\n1. Search for videos from March 2018.\n2. Filter by relevant keywords to identify the one narrated by the voice actor of Gollum.\n\nHere’s the code I will run on the Computer_terminal:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport datetime\n\n# YouTube Data API key\nAPI_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'  # Make sure to use a valid YouTube Data API key\nSEARCH_TERM = '360 VR Gollum'\n\n# Set the time frame for March 2018\nstart_date = '2018-03-01T00:00:00Z'\nend_date = '2018-03-31T23:59:59Z'\n\n# Function to search videos\ndef search_youtube_videos(api_key, search_term, start_date, end_date):\n    search_url = f'https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?key={api_key}&q={search_term}&type=video&part=snippet&publishedAfter={start_date}&publishedBefore={end_date}&maxResults=50'\n    response = requests.get(search_url)\n    return response.json()\n\n# Search for videos\nvideos_data = search_youtube_videos(API_KEY, SEARCH_TERM, start_date, end_date)\nvideos_data\n```\n\nI will run this code to identify any potential videos that match the criteria."}
