Thankfully reruns play so at least that&apos;s in order.\\n\\nMeet Dr. John Becker who runs a practice in the Bronx played by Cheers Ted Danson, an arrogant and outspoken man in his middle ages who very deep inside has a heart of gold. But you have to look really deep. And in the right area. In the practice set in the Bronx we have Margaret Wyborn care of Hattie Winston, a driven and more than capable nurse who sometimes seems to appear to be the boss not always so happily married to Louis, and the assistant Linda who is ditzily portrayed by Shawnee Smith, the polar opposite who does hardly any work if at all and has an ever-changing appearance and extremely active social life and whose excuses are usually preceded by the classic &quot;Here&apos;s the thing.&quot; And the diner Becker regularly visits we get to know Regina &quot;Reggie&quot; Kostas who is played by DS9&apos;s Terry Farrell, whose late father gave her the inheritance of Becker&apos;s favorite diner. Very unfortunately she was fired from the show in the fourth season and was replaced by Nancy Travis who played Christina &quot;Chris&quot; Connor who became a love interest for Becker later in the seasons and takes over the diner after Reggie leaves town. Also at the diner there is Jake, who is exemplarily portrayed as a blind man who has a newsstand there and is John&apos;s best friend because as he said in one episode &quot;I don&apos;t listen to him. That&apos;s why we&apos;re friends.&quot; Oh, and Bob, a divorced man who at first is openly interested in Reggie who was a fellow high-schooler and has a tendency to be self-seeking and talk in third person narrative. He was a recurring guest for twelve episodes and later left the show and his absence was explained by his being on vacation and it was left at that. His replacement was somewhat inadequate, Hector Lopez, the brother of one of Jake&apos;s old friends.\\n\\nIt never does get old with this show. There are really only three basic settings (the practice, the diner, and Becker&apos;s apartment) which makes for familiarity once you really get into it, which isn&apos;t all that hard. There are so many good one-liners and retorts and comebacks from really everybody, which makes for a well-balanced if not super famous cast. With such good scripts it&apos;s appalling that they couldn&apos;t at least think of better reasons for Reggie and Bob&apos;s departure from the show. Neither of their replacements had the old charm of the original characters. Much harm was done if you ask me, but the show continued being funny although in my opinion the first four seasons with Reggie were the best, no question about it. At first glance you might not think much of it, as I had at first but once you get over how boring it looks you realize how accurately &apos;don&apos;t judge a book by its cover&apos; works for this show. I really hope the six seasons turn into DVD&apos;s and that the show returns on air because it really was a great show. Fortunately there are still remnants of it: reruns play regularly and if you&apos;re lucky you&apos;ll have time to watch them.\"\n        },\n        \"aggregateRating\": {\n            \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n            \"ratingCount\": 15043,\n            \"bestRating\": 10,\n            \"worstRating\": 1,\n            \"ratingValue\": 7.3\n        },\n        \"contentRating\": \"TV-PG\",\n        \"genre\": [\n            \"Comedy\"\n        ],\n        \"datePublished\": \"1998-11-02\",\n        \"keywords\": \"character name as series title,male protagonist,sitcom comedy,laugh track,21st century\",\n        \"actor\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001101/\",\n                \"name\": \"Ted Danson\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935589/\",\n                \"name\": \"Hattie Winston\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000395/\",\n                \"name\": \"Terry Farrell\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"creator\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0093795/\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0024345/\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0053559/\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0352396/\",\n                \"name\": \"Dave Hackel\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"trailer\": {\n            \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n            \"name\": \"Becker: The First Season\",\n            \"embedUrl\": \"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2783445273/\",\n            \"thumbnail\": {\n                \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n                \"contentUrl\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGUyNjE2NTItYTliYi00YzBkLWJkNTUtNmUxZTI2YmY1ZGUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg\"\n            },\n            \"thumbnailUrl\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGUyNjE2NTItYTliYi00YzBkLWJkNTUtNmUxZTI2YmY1ZGUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2783445273/\",\n            \"description\": \"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment\",\n            \"duration\": \"PT31S\",\n            \"uploadDate\": \"2008-06-30T03:06:47Z\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"meta_tags\": {\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width\",\n        \"description\": \"Becker: Created by Dave Hackel.

These actors only get better with age and are wonderfully cast in this sweet Comedy Series! The script gets a little lost trying to solve the mystery and gets more in depth with the character&apos;s storylines. That&apos;s ok because you have a pretty good idea who is the culprit about half way through. You don&apos;t mind that it isn&apos;t really a mystery because you are just having a fun time watching these golden oldies work and show their stuff. It&apos;s really no mystery. Just a tribute to how brave you have to be an older citizen and still active and feel seen in our youth oriented society. What a sweet tribute to those who support and help us navigate the minefields of getting old this series was.

But it doesn't take long for Eleanor to realize she's there by mistake. She hides in plain sight from the Good Place's architect, Michael, and his all-knowing assistant, Janet. Her seemingly perfect neighbors, Tahani and Jason, and open-hearted soul mate, Chidi, help her realize that it's never too late to change. With the help of her new friends -- and a few enemies -- Eleanor becomes determined to shed her old way of life in hopes of discovering a new one in the afterlife. \nWatch on Fandango at Home\n Buy Now \nWhat to Watch\nIn Theaters\nAt Home\nTV Shows\nNew TV Tonight\n View All \nNew TV TonightUntamed\n88%\n\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\n\n{\n    \"jsonld\": {\n        \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"TVSeries\",\n        \"actor\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Kristen Bell\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/kristen_bell\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/m2MwG8IfvbmUVXoF5UC3TThDzlE=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/267864_v9_bb.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Ted Danson\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ted_danson\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/mbpkYQOqQ9xCBz8C3msqV7To5c0=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/GNLZZGG0024P4MZ.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"William Jackson Harper\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/william_jackson_harper\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/dDrYSMIjzwKWPJIlqmysh9yH20Q=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/729179_v9_bb.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"Jameela Jamil\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/jameela_jamil\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/OdCNaO7el89jxk5fppkX-ZBXKaI=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/600043_v9_bb.jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Person\",\n                \"name\": \"D'Arcy Carden\",\n                \"sameAs\": \"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/darcy_carden\",\n                \"image\": \"https://resizing.flixster.com/J_dR-9UxvaiU_vD2swKRWXE-rio=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/-XZAfHZM39UwaGJIFWKAE8fS0ak=/v3/t/assets/968678_v9_bc.jpg\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"aggregateRating\": {\n            \"@type\": \"AggregateRating\",\n            \"bestRating\": \"100\",\n            \"description\": \"The Tomatometer rating \\u2013 based on the published opinions of hundreds of film and television critics \\u2013 is a trusted measurement of movie and TV programming quality for millions of moviegoers.

Becker is a traditional style sitcom, much in the blend of the popular ones which went before it like Frasier and Cheers.Who plays Dr John Becker?\nThe run down is simple, Ted Danson plays Dr John Becker a dedicated and talented doctor who has a very gruff exterior. The episodes revolve around his work in his practise and his interactions with his friends at his local diner.Does John Becker have a 'sitcom'?\nThe only other thing the 2 share is that the star of Frasier, Kelsey Grammar, also features in a cameo in an episode of it. The situation part of the 'sitcom' of Becker is that John Becker, a slightly bitter and abrasively outspoken doctor has set up a crummy practice in the middle of New York's Bronx.Who is Dr John Becker?\nSynopsis Dr. John Becker is easily annoyed -- by noisy neighbors, a ridiculous comment, a flickering streetlight, the antics of his misfit staff members. He's a talented and dedicated doctor and goes the extra mile for those in need, but he doesn't waste a chance to give anyone a piece of his mind.When was the first part of 'Becker vs Becker' released?\nThe first part premiered at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival on 19 February 2023. The film was released in two parts on Apple TV+ from April 7, 2023.
