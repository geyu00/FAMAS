{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a contributor to a specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The specific version of OpenCV where support for Mask-RCNN was added.\n   - The contributors to that specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Authoritative sources for these facts could include the official OpenCV GitHub repository, release notes, and historical records of Chinese political leaders.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Matching the names of contributors to the OpenCV version with the names of former Chinese heads of government based on their Latin alphabet transliterations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most likely former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor's name could be Deng Xiaoping, as his name is commonly transliterated and relatively well-known.\n   - Another possibility could be Zhou Enlai, another prominent figure in Chinese history.\n   - The contributor's name might be a common Chinese name, which could increase the likelihood of a match.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **Identify the specific version of OpenCV where Mask-RCNN support was added:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search to find the specific version of OpenCV that added support for Mask-RCNN. Look for official release notes or documentation.\n  \n- **List the contributors to that version of OpenCV:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Once the specific version is identified, navigate to the OpenCV GitHub repository and find the contributors for that version. This can often be found in the release notes or the commit history.\n\n- **List the names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search to compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin alphabet transliteration.\n\n- **Match the names of contributors to the names of former Chinese heads of government:**\n  - **Assistant:** Compare the list of contributors to the list of former Chinese heads of government to identify any matches.\n\n- **Verify the match:**\n  - **WebSurfer:** If a potential match is found, verify the contributor's involvement in the specific version of OpenCV by checking their contributions in the GitHub repository.\n\n- **Compile and present the final answer:**\n  - **Assistant:** Summarize the findings and provide the name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a contributor to a specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - The specific version of OpenCV where support for Mask-RCNN was added is 4.0.0-pre, as indicated by the issue #11412 on the OpenCV GitHub repository.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The contributors to the OpenCV version 4.0.0-pre, specifically those who worked on the DNN module during that time.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Authoritative sources for these facts could include the official OpenCV GitHub repository, release notes, and historical records of Chinese political leaders.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Matching the names of contributors to the OpenCV version 4.0.0-pre with the names of former Chinese heads of government based on their Latin alphabet transliterations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most likely former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor's name could be Deng Xiaoping, as his name is commonly transliterated and relatively well-known.\n   - Another possibility could be Zhou Enlai, another prominent figure in Chinese history.\n   - The contributor's name might be a common Chinese name, which could increase the likelihood of a match.\n   - Given the focus on the DNN module, key contributors to this module should be prioritized. From the contributors list, alalek (Alexander Alekhin) has a significant number of commits, but his name does not match any known former Chinese head of government. Therefore, we should look at other contributors who were active around the time of the 4.0.0-pre release.\n\n**Additional Hunches:**\n   - Since the DNN module is crucial for Mask-RCNN support, we should focus on contributors who have a history of working on deep learning and neural network-related features in OpenCV.\n   - The name \"Deng\" is a common Chinese surname, and there are several contributors with Chinese names in the OpenCV repository. We should check the commit history and contributor list for names that start with \"Deng\" or other common Chinese surnames.\n   - It might be useful to cross-reference the commit history of the 4.0.0-pre release with the names of former Chinese heads of government to see if any names match.\n\nLet's proceed by focusing on the contributors to the DNN module in the 4.0.0-pre version and cross-referencing their names with the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\nThe root cause of the failure was the repeated attempts to navigate through the OpenCV GitHub repository and find the contributors for the 4.0.0-pre version, which led to an excessive context length error in the web surfing process. This error indicates that the messages and context being processed exceeded the maximum token limit allowed by the model, causing the request to fail.\n\n### New Plan\n\nTo avoid repeating the same mistakes and ensure we efficiently find the required information, the new plan will focus on:\n\n1. **Minimize Context Length**:\n   - Break down the tasks into smaller, more manageable steps to reduce the amount of context in each request.\n   - Use more targeted searches and interactions to gather the necessary information without overwhelming the model.\n\n2. **Focus on Specific Information**:\n   - Directly navigate to the specific parts of the OpenCV GitHub repository that contain the commit history and contributor information for the 4.0.0-pre version.\n   - Use the search functionality within the repository to find relevant commits and contributors.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference with Historical Data**:\n   - Once the contributors are identified, cross-reference their names with the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n### Concise Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the OpenCV 4.0.0-pre Release Notes**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Go to the OpenCV GitHub repository and navigate to the release notes for version 4.0.0-pre.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Extract the date of the 4.0.0-pre release and any relevant information about the contributors involved in the DNN module.\n\n- **Step 2: Find Contributors to the DNN Module in 4.0.0-pre**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Use the search functionality within the OpenCV GitHub repository to find commits related to the DNN module in the 4.0.0-pre version.\n  - **WebSurfer:** List the contributors who made significant contributions to the DNN module during that period.\n\n- **Step 3: Cross-Reference Contributor Names with Former Chinese Heads of Government**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin alphabet transliteration.\n  - **Assistant:** Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government to identify any matches.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify the Match**\n  - **WebSurfer:** If a potential match is found, verify the contributor's involvement in the 4.0.0-pre version by checking their contributions in the GitHub repository.\n\n- **Step 5: Compile and Present the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant:** Summarize the findings and provide the name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**: When searching within the OpenCV repository, use specific terms like \"Mask-RCNN 4.0.0-pre\" and \"DNN module 4.0.0-pre\" to narrow down the results.\n- **Limit Context in Each Request**: Break down the tasks into smaller steps and only include the necessary context in each request to avoid exceeding the token limit.\n- **Utilize Repository Features**: Make use of the repository's search and filter features to find relevant commits and contributors more efficiently."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a contributor to a specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - The specific version of OpenCV where support for Mask-RCNN was added is 4.0.0-pre, as indicated by the issue #11412 on the OpenCV GitHub repository.\n   - The 4.0.0-pre release was part of the development leading to the 4.0.0 release, which introduced significant improvements in the DNN module.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The contributors to the OpenCV version 4.0.0-pre, specifically those who worked on the DNN module during that time.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Authoritative sources for these facts could include the official OpenCV GitHub repository, release notes, and historical records of Chinese political leaders.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Matching the names of contributors to the OpenCV version 4.0.0-pre with the names of former Chinese heads of government based on their Latin alphabet transliterations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most likely former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor's name could be Deng Xiaoping, as his name is commonly transliterated and relatively well-known.\n   - Another possibility could be Zhou Enlai, another prominent figure in Chinese history.\n   - The contributor's name might be a common Chinese name, which could increase the likelihood of a match.\n   - Given the focus on the DNN module, key contributors to this module should be prioritized. From the contributors list, alalek (Alexander Alekhin) has a significant number of commits, but his name does not match any known former Chinese head of government. Therefore, we should look at other contributors who were active around the time of the 4.0.0-pre release.\n   - The name \"Deng\" is a common Chinese surname, and there are several contributors with Chinese names in the OpenCV repository. We should check the commit history and contributor list for names that start with \"Deng\" or other common Chinese surnames.\n   - It might be useful to cross-reference the commit history of the 4.0.0-pre release with the names of former Chinese heads of government to see if any names match.\n\n### Additional Hunches:\n   - Since the DNN module is crucial for Mask-RCNN support, we should focus on contributors who have a history of working on deep learning and neural network-related features in OpenCV.\n   - The name \"Deng\" is a common Chinese surname, and there are several contributors with Chinese names in the OpenCV repository. We should check the commit history and contributor list for names that start with \"Deng\" or other common Chinese surnames.\n   - It might be useful to cross-reference the commit history of the 4.0.0-pre release with the names of former Chinese heads of government to see if any names match.\n   - Given the significance of the DNN module, contributors who have made substantial contributions to this module are more likely to be listed in the release notes or changelogs. We should focus on these contributors first.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the 4.0.0-pre Release Notes**:\n   - Go to the OpenCV GitHub repository and navigate to the release notes for version 4.0.0-pre.\n   - Extract the date of the 4.0.0-pre release and any relevant information about the contributors involved in the DNN module.\n\n2. **Find Contributors to the DNN Module in 4.0.0-pre**:\n   - Use the search functionality within the OpenCV GitHub repository to find commits related to the DNN module in the 4.0.0-pre version.\n   - List the contributors who made significant contributions to the DNN module during that period.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference Contributor Names with Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - Compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin alphabet transliteration.\n   - Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government to identify any matches.\n\n4. **Verify the Match**:\n   - If a potential match is found, verify the contributor's involvement in the 4.0.0-pre version by checking their contributions in the GitHub repository.\n\n5. **Compile and Present the Final Answer**:\n   - Summarize the findings and provide the name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step by navigating to the 4.0.0-pre release notes and extracting the necessary information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\nThe root cause of the failure was the inability to efficiently locate and extract the specific information needed from the OpenCV GitHub repository. The repeated attempts to navigate through the changelog and release notes led to inefficiencies and did not yield the required details about the contributors and their involvement in the DNN module for the 4.0.0-pre release.\n\n### New Plan\n\nTo avoid repeating the same mistakes and ensure we efficiently find the required information, the new plan will focus on:\n\n1. **Minimize Context Length**:\n   - Break down the tasks into smaller, more manageable steps to reduce the amount of context in each request.\n   - Use more targeted searches and interactions to gather the necessary information without overwhelming the model.\n\n2. **Focus on Specific Information**:\n   - Directly navigate to the specific parts of the OpenCV GitHub repository that contain the commit history and contributor information for the 4.0.0-pre version.\n   - Use the search functionality within the repository to find relevant commits and contributors.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference with Historical Data**:\n   - Once the contributors are identified, cross-reference their names with the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n### Concise Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the 4.0.0-pre Release Page**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Go to the OpenCV GitHub repository and navigate to the release page for version 4.0.0-pre.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Extract the date of the 4.0.0-pre release and any relevant information about the contributors involved in the DNN module.\n\n- **Step 2: Find Relevant Commits and Contributors**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Use the search functionality within the OpenCV GitHub repository to find commits related to the DNN module in the 4.0.0-pre version.\n  - **WebSurfer:** List the contributors who made significant contributions to the DNN module during that period.\n\n- **Step 3: Cross-Reference Contributor Names with Former Chinese Heads of Government**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin alphabet transliteration.\n  - **Assistant:** Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government to identify any matches.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify the Match**\n  - **WebSurfer:** If a potential match is found, verify the contributor's involvement in the 4.0.0-pre version by checking their contributions in the GitHub repository.\n\n- **Step 5: Compile and Present the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant:** Summarize the findings and provide the name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**: When searching within the OpenCV repository, use specific terms like \"Mask-RCNN 4.0.0-pre\" and \"DNN module 4.0.0-pre\" to narrow down the results.\n- **Limit Context in Each Request**: Break down the tasks into smaller steps and only include the necessary context in each request to avoid exceeding the token limit.\n- **Utilize Repository Features**: Make use of the repository's search and filter features to find relevant commits and contributors more efficiently.\n- **Focus on Key Contributors**: Prioritize contributors who have a history of working on deep learning and neural network-related features in OpenCV.\n\n### Action Items\n\n- **WebSurfer:** Go to the OpenCV GitHub repository and navigate to the release page for version 4.0.0-pre.\n- **WebSurfer:** Extract the date of the 4.0.0-pre release and any relevant information about the contributors involved in the DNN module.\n- **WebSurfer:** Use the search functionality within the OpenCV GitHub repository to find commits related to the DNN module in the 4.0.0-pre version.\n- **WebSurfer:** List the contributors who made significant contributions to the DNN module during that period.\n- **WebSurfer:** Compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin alphabet transliteration.\n- **Assistant:** Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government to identify any matches.\n- **WebSurfer:** Verify the contributor's involvement in the 4.0.0-pre version by checking their contributions in the GitHub repository.\n- **Assistant:** Summarize the findings and provide the name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government."}

{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhich contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with additional insights and educated guesses:\n\n### Fact Sheet\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The request is about finding a contributor to a specific version of OpenCV.\n   - The version of OpenCV in question is one where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model.\n   - The contributor's name must match the name of a former Chinese head of government when both are transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - The specific version of OpenCV where support for Mask-RCNN was added is 4.0.0-pre, as indicated by the issue #11412 on the OpenCV GitHub repository.\n   - The 4.0.0-pre release was part of the development leading to the 4.0.0 release, which introduced significant improvements in the DNN module.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The contributors to the OpenCV version 4.0.0-pre, specifically those who worked on the DNN module during that time.\n   - The names of former Chinese heads of government, transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n   - Authoritative sources for these facts could include the official OpenCV GitHub repository, release notes, and historical records of Chinese political leaders.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Matching the names of contributors to the OpenCV version 4.0.0-pre with the names of former Chinese heads of government based on their Latin alphabet transliterations.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - The most likely former Chinese head of government whose name might match a contributor's name could be Deng Xiaoping, as his name is commonly transliterated and relatively well-known.\n   - Another possibility could be Zhou Enlai, another prominent figure in Chinese history.\n   - The contributor's name might be a common Chinese name, which could increase the likelihood of a match.\n   - Given the focus on the DNN module, key contributors to this module should be prioritized. From the contributors list, alalek (Alexander Alekhin) has a significant number of commits, but his name does not match any known former Chinese head of government. Therefore, we should look at other contributors who were active around the time of the 4.0.0-pre release.\n   - The name \"Deng\" is a common Chinese surname, and there are several contributors with Chinese names in the OpenCV repository. We should check the commit history and contributor list for names that start with \"Deng\" or other common Chinese surnames.\n   - It might be useful to cross-reference the commit history of the 4.0.0-pre release with the names of former Chinese heads of government to see if any names match.\n\n### Additional Hunches:\n   - Since the DNN module is crucial for Mask-RCNN support, we should focus on contributors who have a history of working on deep learning and neural network-related features in OpenCV.\n   - The name \"Deng\" is a common Chinese surname, and there are several contributors with Chinese names in the OpenCV repository. We should check the commit history and contributor list for names that start with \"Deng\" or other common Chinese surnames.\n   - It might be useful to cross-reference the commit history of the 4.0.0-pre release with the names of former Chinese heads of government to see if any names match.\n   - Given the significance of the DNN module, contributors who have made substantial contributions to this module are more likely to be listed in the release notes or changelogs. We should focus on these contributors first.\n\n### Updated Educated Guesses:\n   - **Deng Xiaoping** is a strong candidate because his name is well-known and commonly transliterated. If there is a contributor named \"Deng\" or a similar variant, this could be a match.\n   - **Zhou Enlai** is another prominent figure whose name is commonly transliterated. If there is a contributor named \"Zhou,\" this could also be a match.\n   - **Li Peng** is another former Chinese head of government whose name is commonly transliterated. If there is a contributor named \"Li,\" this could be a match.\n   - **Hu Jintao** is a former Chinese head of government whose name is commonly transliterated. If there is a contributor named \"Hu,\" this could be a match.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Navigate to the 4.0.0-pre Release Notes**:\n   - Go to the OpenCV GitHub repository and navigate to the release notes for version 4.0.0-pre.\n   - Extract the date of the 4.0.0-pre release and any relevant information about the contributors involved in the DNN module.\n\n2. **Find Contributors to the DNN Module in 4.0.0-pre**:\n   - Use the search functionality within the OpenCV GitHub repository to find commits related to the DNN module in the 4.0.0-pre version.\n   - List the contributors who made significant contributions to the DNN module during that period.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference Contributor Names with Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n   - Compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin alphabet transliteration.\n   - Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government to identify any matches.\n\n4. **Verify the Match**:\n   - If a potential match is found, verify the contributor's involvement in the 4.0.0-pre version by checking their contributions in the GitHub repository.\n\n5. **Compile and Present the Final Answer**:\n   - Summarize the findings and provide the name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n\n### Action Items:\n- **WebSurfer:** Go to the OpenCV GitHub repository and navigate to the release notes for version 4.0.0-pre.\n- **WebSurfer:** Extract the date of the 4.0.0-pre release and any relevant information about the contributors involved in the DNN module.\n- **WebSurfer:** Use the search functionality within the OpenCV GitHub repository to find commits related to the DNN module in the 4.0.0-pre version.\n- **WebSurfer:** List the contributors who made significant contributions to the DNN module during that period.\n- **WebSurfer:** Compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin alphabet transliteration.\n- **Assistant:** Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government to identify any matches.\n- **WebSurfer:** Verify the contributor's involvement in the 4.0.0-pre version by checking their contributions in the GitHub repository.\n- **Assistant:** Summarize the findings and provide the name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n\nLet's proceed with the next step by navigating to the 4.0.0-pre release notes and extracting the necessary information.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\nThe root cause of the failure was the inability to effectively search and locate the specific commits and contributors related to the DNN module and Mask-RCNN support in the 4.0.0-pre version of OpenCV. The search queries used were too broad or incorrect, leading to zero results. Additionally, the search functionality within the GitHub repository was not utilized effectively to filter and find the relevant information.\n\n### New Plan\n\nTo avoid repeating the same mistakes and ensure we efficiently find the required information, the new plan will focus on:\n\n1. **Minimize Context Length**:\n   - Break down the tasks into smaller, more manageable steps to reduce the amount of context in each request.\n\n2. **Focus on Specific Information**:\n   - Use more targeted and specific search queries to find the relevant commits and contributors.\n\n3. **Utilize Repository Features**:\n   - Make use of the repository's search and filter features to find relevant commits and contributors more efficiently.\n\n4. **Cross-Reference with Historical Data**:\n   - Once the contributors are identified, cross-reference their names with the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n### Concise Plan\n\n- **Step 1: Navigate to the 4.0.0-pre Release Notes**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Go to the OpenCV GitHub repository and navigate to the release notes for version 4.0.0-pre.\n  - **WebSurfer:** Extract the date of the 4.0.0-pre release and any relevant information about the contributors involved in the DNN module.\n\n- **Step 2: Find Relevant Commits and Contributors**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Use the search functionality within the OpenCV GitHub repository to find commits related to the DNN module and Mask-RCNN support in the 4.0.0-pre version.\n  - **WebSurfer:** List the contributors who made significant contributions to the DNN module during that period.\n\n- **Step 3: Cross-Reference Contributor Names with Former Chinese Heads of Government**\n  - **WebSurfer:** Compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin alphabet transliteration.\n  - **Assistant:** Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government to identify any matches.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify the Match**\n  - **WebSurfer:** If a potential match is found, verify the contributor's involvement in the 4.0.0-pre version by checking their contributions in the GitHub repository.\n\n- **Step 5: Compile and Present the Final Answer**\n  - **Assistant:** Summarize the findings and provide the name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n\n### Hints to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n- **Use Specific Search Terms**:\n  - Use the search query `repo:opencv/opencv DNN module Mask-RCNN 4.0.0-pre` to find relevant commits.\n  - If no results are found, try broader terms like `repo:opencv/opencv DNN module Mask-RCNN` and filter by date range around the 4.0.0-pre release.\n\n- **Limit Context in Each Request**:\n  - Break down the tasks into smaller steps and only include the necessary context in each request to avoid exceeding the token limit.\n\n- **Utilize Repository Features**:\n  - Use the repository's advanced search and filter features to find relevant commits and contributors more efficiently.\n\n- **Focus on Key Contributors**:\n  - Prioritize contributors who have a history of working on deep learning and neural network-related features in OpenCV.\n\n### Action Items\n\n- **WebSurfer:** Go to the OpenCV GitHub repository and navigate to the release notes for version 4.0.0-pre.\n- **WebSurfer:** Extract the date of the 4.0.0-pre release and any relevant information about the contributors involved in the DNN module.\n- **WebSurfer:** Use the search functionality within the OpenCV GitHub repository to find commits related to the DNN module and Mask-RCNN support in the 4.0.0-pre version.\n- **WebSurfer:** List the contributors who made significant contributions to the DNN module during that period.\n- **WebSurfer:** Compile a list of former Chinese heads of government and their names in Latin alphabet transliteration.\n- **Assistant:** Compare the list of contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government to identify any matches.\n- **WebSurfer:** Verify the contributor's involvement in the 4.0.0-pre version by checking their contributions in the GitHub repository.\n- **Assistant:** Summarize the findings and provide the name of the contributor who matches the name of a former Chinese head of government."}
