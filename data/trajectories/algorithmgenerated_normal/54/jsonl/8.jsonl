{"agent": "ClinicalTrials_Expert", "content": "It appears that we are consistently receiving a 404 error across multiple attempts to access different endpoints of the NIH clinical trials API.

Go to the NIH Clinical Trials website at [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov).\n2. In the search bar, enter \"H. pylori acne vulgaris\" to find related trials.\n3. Filter the results by the date range from January 2018 to May 2018 to narrow down to the specific trials conducted within that timeframe.\n4. Check each trial's details for the enrollment count.\n\nAfter obtaining the information, we can ensure its accuracy and validity together. Please let me know what you find!"}
