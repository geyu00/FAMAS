{"agent": "MagenticOneOrchestrator", "content": "We are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhat is the closest eatery to Harkness Memorial State Park that is still open at 11pm on Wednesdays?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nCertainly! Here is the updated fact sheet with the new information and educated guesses:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - The location of interest is Harkness Memorial State Park.\n   - The time of interest is 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n   - The exact address of Harkness Memorial State Park is 275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385.\n   - Waterford Pizza Palace is closed at 11 PM on Wednesdays (opens at 11 AM and closes at 9 PM).\n   - Tony D's is closed at 11 PM on Wednesdays (opens at 11 AM and closes at 7 PM).\n   - Mambo Bar & Restaurant is open until 2:00 AM on Wednesdays (opens at 11 AM).\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - A list of nearby eateries around Harkness Memorial State Park.\n   - Operating hours for Crown Pizza, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Paul's Pasta Shop, specifically on Wednesdays.\n   - Current information about any closures or special hours that might affect the availability of these eateries at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n   - Sources: Google Maps, Yelp, local business directories, official websites of the eateries.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - The distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each nearby eatery.\n   - The closest eatery that is still open at 11 PM on Wednesdays based on the operating hours and distances.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - It is likely that fast food chains or late-night diners will be more likely to be open at 11 PM on Wednesdays compared to fine dining restaurants.\n   - The closest eatery might be within a 1-2 mile radius of Harkness Memorial State Park, as this is a common distance for nearby businesses.\n   - Given the operating hours of Mambo Bar & Restaurant, it is a strong candidate for being the closest eatery open at 11 PM on Wednesdays, provided it is within a reasonable distance from Harkness Memorial State Park.\n   - Buffalo Wild Wings is known for having extended hours, so it is also a likely candidate to be open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n**Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:**\n- **Mambo Bar & Restaurant**: Since it is open until 2:00 AM on Wednesdays, it is a strong candidate if it is within the 1-2 mile radius.\n- **Buffalo Wild Wings**: Known for extended hours, it is another likely candidate to be open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n- **Distance Consideration**: The 1-2 mile radius remains a reasonable estimate for nearby businesses, and verifying the distances will help confirm the closest eatery.\n\nNext steps:\n- Verify the operating hours for Crown Pizza, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Paul's Pasta Shop on Wednesdays.\n- Measure the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park to each of these eateries.\n- Confirm the final result based on the operating hours and distances.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Incorrect Target Location**: The search for Crown Pizza led to a different location (Best Pizza Havemeyer in Brooklyn) instead of the intended location near Harkness Memorial State Park.\n2. **Inefficient Search Strategy**: The search queries were too broad and did not specify the location (Waterford, CT) for the eateries, leading to irrelevant results.\n3. **Lack of Verification**: The operating hours for some eateries were not verified thoroughly, leading to incomplete or incorrect information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Crown Pizza Waterford, CT operating hours Wednesday\" to get the correct location and operating hours.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Buffalo Wild Wings Waterford, CT operating hours Wednesday\" to get the correct location and operating hours.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Paul's Pasta Shop Waterford, CT operating hours Wednesday\" to get the correct location and operating hours.\n\n2. **Verify Operating Hours**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Visit the official websites or Google Maps listings for Crown Pizza, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Paul's Pasta Shop to verify their operating hours for Wednesdays.\n\n3. **Measure Distances**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to measure the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park (275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385) to each of the verified eateries.\n   - **WebSurfer**: Note down the distances and operating hours for each eatery.\n\n4. **Identify the Closest Eateries Open at 11 PM on Wednesdays**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile a list of eateries that are open at 11 PM on Wednesdays based on the verified operating hours.\n   - **Assistant**: Identify the closest eatery from the list based on the measured distances.\n\n5. **Final Verification**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Double-check the operating hours and distance of the closest eatery to ensure accuracy.\n   - **Assistant**: Present the final result, including the name, address, and distance of the closest eatery open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n### Steps to Follow\n\n- **Step 1: Refine Search Queries**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Crown Pizza Waterford, CT operating hours Wednesday\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Buffalo Wild Wings Waterford, CT operating hours Wednesday\".\n  - **WebSurfer**: Search for \"Paul's Pasta Shop Waterford, CT operating hours Wednesday\".\n\n- **Step 2: Verify Operating Hours**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Visit the official websites or Google Maps listings for Crown Pizza, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Paul's Pasta Shop to verify their operating hours for Wednesdays.\n\n- **Step 3: Measure Distances**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Use Google Maps to measure the distance from Harkness Memorial State Park (275 Great Neck Road, Waterford, CT 06385) to each of the verified eateries.\n  - **WebSurfer**: Note down the distances and operating hours for each eatery.\n\n- **Step 4: Identify the Closest Eateries Open at 11 PM on Wednesdays**\n  - **Assistant**: Compile a list of eateries that are open at 11 PM on Wednesdays based on the verified operating hours.\n  - **Assistant**: Identify the closest eatery from the list based on the measured distances.\n\n- **Step 5: Final Verification**\n  - **WebSurfer**: Double-check the operating hours and distance of the closest eatery to ensure accuracy.\n  - **Assistant**: Present the final result, including the name, address, and distance of the closest eatery open at 11 PM on Wednesdays."}

**Buffalo Wild Wings**: Known for extended hours, it is another likely candidate to be open at 11 PM on Wednesdays, despite being slightly farther away.\n   - **Distance Consideration**: The 1-2 mile radius remains a reasonable estimate for nearby businesses, but given the current distances, Mambo Bar & Restaurant is the closest eatery that is open at 11 PM on Wednesdays.\n\n### Reasoning for Updated Educated Guesses:\n- **Mambo Bar & Restaurant**: Since it is open until 2:00 AM on Wednesdays and is the closest eatery that is open at 11 PM, it is the strongest candidate.\n- **Buffalo Wild Wings**: Despite being open until 11 PM, it is farther away (7.1 miles) compared to Mambo Bar & Restaurant.\n- **Distance Consideration**: The 1-2 mile radius is a reasonable estimate, but the current distances show that Mambo Bar & Restaurant is the closest option that meets the criteria.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Verify the exact distance to Mambo Bar & Restaurant from Harkness Memorial State Park.\n- Confirm the final result based on the operating hours and distances.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the verified operating hours and distances, the closest eatery to Harkness Memorial State Park that is still open at 11 PM on Wednesdays is **Mambo Bar & Restaurant**.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n\n1. **Inefficient Search Queries**: The search queries were too broad and did not specify the location (Waterford, CT) for the eateries, leading to irrelevant results.\n2. **Lack of Verification**: The operating hours for some eateries were not verified thoroughly, leading to incomplete or incorrect information.\n3. **Inconsistent Data Collection**: The distances and operating hours were not consistently collected and noted, leading to confusion and repeated searches.\n4. **Overcomplicated Search Requests**: Combining multiple search requests (operating hours and distances) in a single query made it difficult to extract the necessary information.\n\n### New Plan\n\n1. **Refine Search Queries**:\n   -
